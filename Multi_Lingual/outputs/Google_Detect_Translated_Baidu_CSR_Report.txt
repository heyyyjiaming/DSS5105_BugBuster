Baidu believes that AI ethics is the cornerstone of the future development of intelligent society. The rapid rise of AI big models has brought new opportunities to the industry and society, while the widespread application of AI big models has also brought many challenges in science and technology ethics. Baidu firmly believes that the mission of AI is to serve people. To this end, Baidu continues to improve AI ethics standards to ensure that AI technology brings benefits to mankind.
# AI Ethics Practice
Baidu strengthens communication and cooperation with industry organizations, research institutions and other relevant parties, actively explores and promotes the research of scientific and technological ethics norms and standards, and participates in and improves the construction of AI ethics standards.

Baidu founder Robin Li proposed the “Four Principles of AI Ethics” in 2018, namely:
- The highest principle of AI is safety and controllability;
- The innovative vision of AI is to promote more equal access to technology and capabilities for humans;
- The value of AI is to teach people to learn and help them grow, not to surpass or replace them;
- The ultimate goal of AI is to bring more freedom and possibilities to humans.
This principle aims to establish a common concept and rules for all AI products and technologies to be followed by the whole society, create responsible and sustainable AI products, and solve the problem of harmonious coexistence between AI and humans.
# AI Ethics Training
In 2023, Baidu invited professors from the Data Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law to conduct a training on the theme of &quot;International Governance of Artificial Intelligence and Technological Ethics&quot;, and conducted in-depth discussions on courses such as the legality and compliance of large AI models, fairness and impartiality during operation, and AI accountability mechanisms. The training is aimed at Baidu&#39;s Technology Strategy Committee and T9 (Chief Architect) and above employees, aiming to deepen the understanding of technological ethics from the top level, provide a more solid ethical foundation for the company&#39;s technological development and strategic decision-making, and lead the direction of future technological development.

Baidu has built a complete heterogeneous data set and optimized AI fairness from the acquisition aspect. In addition, Baidu continues to improve its recommendation strategy in the development and application of large-model products, effectively avoiding the problem of information cocoons and presenting a broader world to users.
# AI Safety and Ethical Standards
In 2023, Baidu formulated a number of AI safety and ethics standards, covering algorithms, privacy protection, deep learning, autonomous driving, smart terminals, system services and many other aspects, and is committed to building a healthy and reliable artificial intelligence industry development ecosystem.

The system covers stakeholders such as employees, users, supply chains, and communities, and is applicable to Baidu, entities owned by the company, entities in which the company holds a majority stake, and institutions managed by the company. At the same time, we invite Baidu&#39;s partners and suppliers to follow the system and encourage them to develop human rights protection systems that suit their actual conditions.
Following the guidance of the UNGPs, we have built Baidu&#39;s human rights tracking indicator system, which covers various human rights issues in Baidu&#39;s key business scenarios, including: the right to privacy and information self-determination, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to equality and freedom from discrimination, the right to freedom from harassment and violence, anti-corruption and human rights, the right to life and health, the right to social security, the right to fair and favorable working conditions, etc.
We work with third-party human rights experts to regularly conduct company-wide due diligence on human rights impacts. We track internal and external human rights protections annually to identify potential impacts and risks in order to avoid or mitigate potential human rights risks in the company and its value chain. At the same time, we provide or take fair and just remedial measures for the negative human rights impacts that have been identified as a result of the company&#39;s business activities. Baidu discloses the risk identification, tracking and response to various human rights issues in this report (see Appendix - Human Rights Tracking Indicator Index Table for details).

# How does Baidu use AI technology to protect people’s right to life?
Baidu is always thinking about how to use warm technology to create a happier life for society and residents. In urban scenarios related to water, we have explored a way to apply AI technology to protect the lives of residents.
# How does Baidu enable climate change monitoring?
In 2023, Baidu participated in the construction of the smart water project in Lintao County, Gansu Province, implemented the &quot;Special Action for Water Safety&quot;, and provided AI video analysis capabilities for the Taohe River Basin.
In order to achieve the smart meteorological goals of &quot;intelligent observation, accurate forecast, open service, scientific management and continuous innovation&quot;, Baidu combines meteorological edge-cloud fusion perception technology with AI intelligent analysis technology to launch a new model of intelligent meteorological observation. In the &quot;City Brain&quot; system in Haidian, we added the &quot;Sky Face Recognition&quot; solution, using urban video resources and artificial intelligence visual recognition algorithm technology to conduct comprehensive intelligent recognition of various weather and social scenes such as rainfall, snowfall, snow accumulation, road icing, and willow catkins, so as to achieve &quot;real-time, fixed-point, and full-volume&quot; collection of meteorological observation data and provide &quot;precise, accurate, and detailed&quot; meteorological services, so as to better serve the society and ensure people&#39;s quality of life and the safe operation of the city.
The crowded overpass area is a key location for observing and monitoring high-risk rivers. Baidu&#39;s AI cameras accurately observe and analyze the behavior of people around the river flowing through the bustling commercial district. Once any potential suicidal behavior is captured, such as climbing over the railing, approaching the edge of the water, and wandering in the dangerous area, the system will immediately issue an early warning to ensure that rescuers take measures as soon as possible.
By working closely with local police patrols and fire brigades, the project not only improves emergency response speed, but also greatly enhances rescue efficiency. When an early warning is issued, relevant departments can quickly arrive at the scene, persuade people in potential danger to leave, and provide emergency rescue when necessary, effectively avoiding drowning accidents.
Baidu&#39;s smart water project not only created a new model of intelligent safety management, but also served as an invisible safety net, raising the hope of life for the residents of Lintao County. The successful implementation of this project has made an important contribution to promoting the modernization of regional social governance.
