# 73-year-old grandma teaches people pinyin live
73-year-old Yang Weiyun has been a teacher for 50 years and started to have a most special group of students last year.
There are tens of thousands of these students from all over the country, ranging in age from preschool to 72 years old, mostly middle-aged, and most of them are women. They are illiterate or do not know pinyin, which has caused many obstacles in their lives.
Yang Weiyun&#39;s &quot;Xiyangyang Pinyin Classroom&quot; broadcasts live every morning and evening to teach pinyin and literacy. Over the past year, she has witnessed the changes of many students. Some have mastered pinyin and simple Chinese characters and can read stories to their 5-year-old daughter; some have started to learn ancient poems and have no obstacles in communicating with others.
This made Yang Weiyun more determined to continue live streaming. She knew that there were tens of thousands of people waiting for her in the live streaming room, and that this was a way for her to move towards a broader life. She also felt that &quot;this was truly a way to be useful in old age.&quot;

# Low-carbon development, addressing climate change
Low-carbon development to address climate change
Douyin Group has taken active actions to address climate change, practiced green operations, and minimized its impact on the environment through green technological innovation; and relied on Toutiao, Douyin, and Xigua Video to popularize green knowledge and advocate green development.
# Pursue Low-Carbon Development and Respond to Climate Change
# Green Operations
Douyin Group actively responds to the United Nations’ call for “net zero emissions” and practices low-carbon operations. By building green data centers and promoting green offices, it continues to explore new possibilities for the industry’s low-carbon emission reduction paths.
# Green Data Center
During the data center site selection stage, the Group selects suppliers by examining factors such as low-carbon energy-saving levels and local climate conditions. It encourages each supplier to implement policies in a classified manner, promote green electricity transformation plans, and conduct refined management throughout the entire design and operation and maintenance process to maximize the energy efficiency of the data center.
In 2022, Douyin Group focused on improving the resource utilization of data centers. The PUE of large customized data centers can reach 1.15, and several customized data center parks have won the title of &quot;Carbon Neutral Data Center Leader&quot;. At the same time, we gradually increase the proportion of green energy in data centers through green electricity trading, green certificate purchase, renewable energy and energy storage construction. During the year, the data center used more than 100 million kWh of wind and solar power, and supported computer room partners to apply for source-grid-load-storage projects, effectively increasing the proportion of green electricity in the data center.
# Take multiple measures to improve the efficiency of data center resource utilization
In 2022, Douyin Group proposed a number of self-developed innovative technologies with the core goal of optimizing the cooling method of heat-generating devices to solve the problem of cooling difficulties in high-density data centers.
# High-efficiency liquid cooling technology
It includes cold plate liquid cooling (indirect liquid cooling) and immersion liquid cooling (direct liquid cooling) technologies, which have the advantage of greatly improving heat dissipation efficiency and can provide heat source for large-scale preheating recovery.
# High-density wind wall technology
The solution saves pump power consumption and extends the natural cooling time by increasing the supply liquid temperature and the supply and return liquid temperature difference. It optimizes the natural cooling time by using dew point evaporative cooling technology on the cold source side to achieve ultimate energy saving.
# Waterless cooling technology
The pump-driven phase change technology replaces the indirect evaporative cooling technology to achieve waterless natural cooling. This technology has a better cooling effect and can achieve complete separation between indoor and outdoor areas, avoiding the risk of air leakage.

# Green Office
Douyin Group continues to optimize the digital management of its office park, creating a comfortable and convenient green office space by improving building energy-saving measures and innovative designs. It also helps employees strengthen their awareness of ecological protection and contributes to the group&#39;s long-term, stable and sustainable development.
In terms of work area management, Douyin Group has proposed an intelligent concept, hoping to manage and allocate information such as personnel, equipment, and energy consumption in the work area through the smart park energy efficiency management platform. Among them, the information collection and calculation in the carbon management platform refer to the ISO 14064 series of standards, and are compatible with the Greenhouse Gas Accounting System (GHG Protocol) to achieve refined management of carbon emissions in building workplace scenarios. In 2022, we launched the Smart Park Energy Efficiency Management Platform in the Dazhongsi Work Area, which provided strong support for the group&#39;s low-carbon operations. In addition, the Group also uses asset reuse management methods to recycle employee office equipment under the premise of safety and compliance to avoid direct waste.
# Dazhongsi Smart Park Energy Efficiency Management Platform
The Douyin Group Dazhongsi Smart Park Energy Efficiency Management Platform aims to achieve online system management of work area energy consumption, personnel, space and security, so as to conduct targeted analysis of carbon reduction paths based on relevant data based on statistics of daily water and electricity consumption, and scope 1 and scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions in the work area. The launch of the Smart Park Energy Efficiency Management Platform provides solutions for IoT technology to empower work area management and environmental data monitoring.

# Pursue Low-Carbon Development and Respond to Climate Change
In terms of building energy conservation, for self-built buildings, Douyin Group participates in the building design process with environmental protection requirements that are higher than national standards, and strives to increase the green building certification coverage of its own buildings. The Beijing office area was renovated on the basis of the building structure, and a waste heat recovery device or system was installed while establishing a roof garden. Highly water-efficient sanitary ware was used to increase the water-saving efficiency increment and obtain a two-star green building certification. For leased buildings, we installed an energy metering system and connected it to the group&#39;s energy efficiency management platform. Douyin Group also actively introduced and promoted the use of prefabricated decoration technology to enhance the building&#39;s carbon reduction capacity and environmental benefits by reusing building materials.
# Building Energy Efficiency Design
# Design of double-layer external breathing curtain wall
A double-layer curtain wall design is adopted, and CFD simulation is used to optimize the curtain wall structure details, taking into account both ventilation and energy-saving effects.
# Layout of water-saving appliances
In order to meet the energy-saving requirements for water supply in large public buildings, the Group installed first-class water-saving devices - box-type non-negative pressure water supply devices in all work areas to comprehensively improve the water-saving effect of the work areas.
# Electrical and Mechanical Innovation Design
By adopting intelligent lighting control systems, installing light sensors near windows, and installing occupancy sensors in meeting rooms and office areas, we can save electricity to the greatest extent possible.
# Prefabricated decoration
In the E World Work Area, prefabricated decoration has replaced traditional decoration. It has been calculated that the total emission reduction over the entire life cycle is 46.603 tCO2 compared with traditional decoration, thus achieving effective carbon reduction.
Advocate for environmental protection among employees: Douyin Group hopes to enhance employees&#39; awareness of low-carbon environmental protection by starting with small things in their daily lives, such as water and electricity usage, transportation, and equipment use. At the same time, the Group combines employee public welfare with environmental protection activities to advocate low-carbon living among employees.
