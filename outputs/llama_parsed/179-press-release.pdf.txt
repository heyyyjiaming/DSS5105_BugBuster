Women's Day, we celebrated the successes of 18 inspiring female sellers across Southeast Asia who actively grew their businesses by expanding online via our platform, enrolling in digital commerce courses and participating in Lazada's mega campaigns:

We also want to do more for the communities that we are a part of and be a pillar of support in times of need: When Typhoon Odette swept across the Philippines and severe floods affected Malaysia in 2021, we partnered with disaster-relief organizations to donate essentials to those in need and provided an avenue through our platform for the public to make donations and contribute to relief efforts. At the height of the pandemic, we partnered with various governments across Southeast Asia to roll out vaccination exercises to ensure the health and safety of our frontliners and users:

As we scale our impact; we remain committed to protecting businesses by championing their intellectual property rights to ensure that these financial benefits that the full recognition businesses can earn they deserve. We are the first Southeast Asian digital commerce company with a dedicated Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Protection Team: We use AI algorithms to automatically detect and remove suspected counterfeit listings, and we actively respond to takedown requests through our Intellectual Property Protection Platform technology, the (IPP platform):

Thanks to our ever-improving average time needed to process takedown requests on IPP platform has dropped by more than 40% from 2020 to 2021. In many instances, once counterfeit product listings are removed, users return to purchasing authentic products, boosting sales for these brands.

As a growing business, we also recognize the importance of being responsible stewards and protecting the environment for future generations. In this report; we share more about Lazada's environmental impact and the initiatives that we are currently implementing to provide more sustainable options for our services. We will remain proactive in developing new sustainable initiatives.

# EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES

Opportunity for her to continue the legacy of her family business beyond its brick-and-mortar stores. Elyse knows that her late grandmother, who started Papemelroti 55 years ago, would have been proud of her can-do attitude and entrepreneurial spirit in expanding the business online.

# Empowering the Community

Nadya Amatullah graduated with a degree in communications but decided to pursue her passion by working in the fashion retail industry. She eventually created her own nature-inspired fashion label, Nadjani, and started selling garments on Lazada in 2020.

Nadya employed stay-at-home mothers from her neighborhood to provide job opportunities for the local community. Now, she runs a team of more than 40 people in Bandung, Indonesia, who navigate the environment and challenges together. Since the start of the pandemic, Nadya has challenged her team to brainstorm new ideas to serve the community while exploring alternative revenue streams. As a result, they pivoted to producing reusable fabric masks and products such as aprons and gardening kits for stay-at-home consumers. They also collaborated with influencers to drive sales and participated in Jakarta Fashion Week, which was held in partnership with Lazada.

While Nadya continues to grow Nadjani, she also aims to create more impact in the digital ecosystem by helping to grow and nurture the seller community and to support the livelihoods of those in the local community.

# Pivoting for Success

Kong Wai Theng, a pharmacist by training, owns a small pharmacy in her neighborhood in Selangor named Big Care Mart. In 2015, the local store started to lose customer footfall amid intensifying competition from bigger brands and businesses. Wai Theng realized that digital commerce was picking up pace in Malaysia and decided to bring Big Care Mart onto Lazada, in a bid to make up for lost revenue and to overcome her financial challenges. Despite having no prior experience in digital commerce, she worked hard to equip herself with the necessary know-how and skills via the Lazada University in order to grow her business online.

Today, Wai Theng is an esteemed top seller on Lazada, having been recognized with the Lazada Top Seller Award in the Health category in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Her willingness to experiment with Lazada tools such as vouchers, free shipping options, and marketing solutions has deeply contributed to her success in driving more sales and conversion.

# FROM OUR LEADERS

# EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES

Through Experience

Learning through experience forms the important first pillar of our approach to developing our people: This typically involves regular on-the-job learning and exposure to assignments that appropriately stretch and train our employees. We also believe in nurturing the future generation and work actively with interns to provide them with opportunities to learn about the industry. At the same time, we benefit from the fresh perspectives they bring. Our number of interns has grown exponentially since FY2021, especially in our Regional offices: Indonesia and Vietnam.

Through Others

The second pillar of our approach involves learning through others via close mentoring, collaborative work, and performance reviews. We conduct regular performance reviews and career discussions to support our employees on their career paths at Lazada. The feedback and discussions from our coaching, mentorship, and mobility programs flow into employees' Individual Development Plans, which are incorporated into annual performance reviews.

Through Structured Training

The third pillar we rely on to develop our people is learning through structured training: From the moment a Lazadian begins their journey with us, we provide a holistic learning experience to assimilate them into our culture, integrate them into their teams, and develop their careers and skill sets. In FY2021 and FY2022, we invested in various initiatives and programs to facilitate employee learning and upskilling. We utilized various tools and platforms to provide learning opportunities at every turn for our employees.

# FUTURE-READY WORKFORCE

We developed our own in-house digital learning platform, GROW, to prioritize our employees' learning and work experiences. Launched in February 2020, GROW delivers an interactive and engaging digital learning experience to all Lazadians, enabling them to upskill and go higher, further, and faster. With GROW, we can create unique learning paths with curated learning materials specific to each employee's needs. In recent years, especially with COVID-19, digital learning has taken on an increasingly important role. With GROW, we are able to break past physical barriers and bring digital learning to all Lazadians, providing them with easy access to a wide variety of e-learning courses and opportunities to increase their capabilities, unlock their potential, and transform their careers.

# Developing Talent within the Lazada Ecosystem

Besides investing in our employees, we want to invest in the digital commerce ecosystem to build the workforce of the future. As such, we established initiatives such as LazBeat, Lazada Insider, Lazada University, and the Lazada Learning Festival to engage our sellers and the public.

# LazBeat

LazBeat is the official news hub of Lazada Group. With Lazada at the center of the vibrant and growing digital commerce landscape in Southeast Asia, LazBeat is the go-to destination for the public to gain insights into our Group and regional digital commerce trends. Our coverage spans.

# Takedown Requests:

Lazada's Intellectual Property Protection Platform

Key - to our IP Protection Program is the Intellectual Property Protection (IPP) Platform, an easy-to-use portal for rights holders to submit takedown requests for alleged infringement of intellectual property rights. The IPP Platform accepts takedown requests based on trademarks, copyright, and patent rights and provides comprehensive information regarding takedown requests. This platform allows for bulk submissions and provides real-time updates and visibility on the status of each takedown request. The platform has more than 1,000 registered users. Due to ever-improving technology, the average time needed to process a takedown request dropped by more than 40% between 2020 and 2021.

# Proactive Measures

In March 2020, we piloted a proactive detection program to takedown currently counterfeit goods. The program is being deployed by participating brands and uses technology coupled with data, such as product-specific information from rights holders, to target listings of counterfeit goods even before rights holders report them. In FY2022, we doubled the number of brands participating in this program to reach more than 65 enrolled brands. The program was met with great success, with 98% of proactive removals occurring before transactions took place.

# IPP Plus Program

IPP Plus was introduced in January 2020, offering enhanced service support and expedited takedown processing. Participants are invited into the program.

|33%|Growth in registered accounts on IPP in 2021 compared to the previous year|
|---|---|
|Within 72 hours|Processing time for nearly 90% of all takedown requests filed through IPP|
|45,850 hours|Spent in human review of incoming takedown requests|

# Online-to-Offline Law Enforcement Actions

We work closely with INTERPOL, national law enforcement agencies, and rights holders in counterfeit cases to facilitate information sharing and to provide the necessary evidence and other support. We uphold our high IP standards and contribute where we can to safeguard buyers against counterfeit goods. Over the years, our efforts have included raid actions for key consumer brands, including HP, BMW, and Panasonic. For instance, our efforts and cooperation with the Thai police over the course of several months contributed to the successful dismantling of a Panasonic counterfeiting ring in July 2021 and allowed for the recovery of over 82,000 fake batteries bearing Panasonic's trademark.

# Direct GHG Emissions

Direct GHG emissions occurring from sources owned or controlled by Lazada's operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam in the reporting year: Lazada's Scope 1 emissions sources include:

# Fuel Consumption

Total fuel consumed within Lazada's operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam in the reporting year, expressed in multiples of watt-hours. This consists of direct fuel consumption in RedMart's operations and Lazada Logistics services in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. Lazada Logistics operations in Singapore were excluded as Singapore mainly works with third-party logistics providers and emissions for third-party logistics providers are included under scope 3 emissions.

Singapore emission factors for the RedMart vehicles were sourced from Singapore's Fourth Biennial Update Report (2020). For other countries, the default emissions factors were sourced from the GHG Protocol Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools (2017) while Global Warming Potential (GWP) values were sourced from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014). Gases considered in the calculation include CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O.

# Indirect GHG Emissions

Indirect GHG emissions occurring from the generation of purchased electricity that is consumed in Lazada's owned or controlled operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam in the reporting year. Lazada's Scope 2 emissions sources include:

# Electricity Consumption

Total purchased electricity consumed by Lazada's hubs/facilities in Indonesia (offices, warehouses/fulfillment centers, sortation centers) and in Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam in the reporting year, expressed in multiples of watt-hours. Where electricity consumption data was unavailable for a facility, electricity consumption data was estimated using the electricity consumption intensity corresponding to its facility type relative to its geographical location.

For consistency, grid emission factors used for the reporting year are the latest published operating margin factors available at the time of publication. Gases considered in the calculation include CO₂. Grid emission factors used for the reporting year were taken from government sources including the Energy Market Authority of Singapore and Ministry of Energy of Thailand; and from international reports including the IGES List of Grid Emission Factors and the Climate Transparency report.

# Other Indirect GHG Emissions

Other indirect GHG emissions that are a consequence of Lazada's activities and reporting year but occur from sources that are not owned or controlled by Lazada: Lazada's reported Scope 3 emissions sources were selected based on the significance of their contribution to total emissions, influence Lazada has over the emissions category, and data feasibility. They include:
