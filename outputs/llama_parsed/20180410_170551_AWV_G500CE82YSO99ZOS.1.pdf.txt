Captii invests in technology and innovation. In 2017 we invested in 4 new start-ups from Singapore and Indonesia, bringing our investees in the venture investment portfolio to a total of 14 companies from 6 countries. Some of our investees are global enterprises with customers from all over the world. A number are regional players in South East Asia and the rest firmly focused on winning in their large home markets of Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

Our venture investment portfolio has grown significantly from when we first started out in 2015. By the end of 2017 our portfolio was fair-valued at S$9.3 million versus investment cost of S$6.7 million. The companies we have invested in are engaged in a variety of businesses but the portfolio has a strong bias towards fintech and B2B ventures. More than three-quarters of our investees are fintech or enterprise-application start-ups.

One fintech start-up in the portfolio is entirely home-grown. PostPay (formerly known as Mobilization) evolved from our Unifiedcomms business over the past 3 years. This business has shown promising growth in terms of revenue and also technology. We are hopeful that it is the first of many home-grown start-ups to develop from within our group. Growth at PostPay this year has complemented the continued advance of GlobeOSS in the telco big data and analytics field. GlobeOSS now counts all of the telcos in Malaysia as customers and further grew its market share in 2017. It is now one of the most prominent telecoms-focused solution providers and systems integrators in the industry. Unifiedcomms including our Ahead Mobile business, however, did not see growth in its underlying business. For this business, 2017 developed into a year of consolidation for the market for their products and services. Much effort was invested in enhancing the application and platform product portfolio as well as in bolstering technical capabilities and capacity to address an increasingly more internet driven landscape for telecoms service providers.

# Annual Report 2017

# Executive Chairman’s Letter

Dear Captii Shareholder:

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present the Annual Report of Captii Limited for the financial year ended 31 December 2017.

# A year of contrasts

Our Group entered 2017 on a strong footing having delivered nine consecutive years of profits.

Our GlobeOSS business generated higher revenue this year while our Unifiedcomms business unfortunately did not. Group system sale contract revenues was relatively flat for 2017. GlobeOSS posted revenue of S$13.1 million, an increase of 19.2% from the S$11.0 million recorded in 2016. Unifiedcomms revenue in contrast declined by 4.5% to S$11.7 million in 2017 compared to the S$12.3 million achieved the year before. The higher revenue delivered by GlobeOSS – which more than offset the decline in Unifiedcomms revenue performance – was the main driver for the S$1.4 million improvement in overall Group revenue for the year to S$24.8 million.

# Investing in technology and innovation

Gross profit recorded was lower this year and in spite of the 5.8% increase in Group revenue, Group gross profit declined by 9.2%. This reflected the considerably lower average gross profit margin for the year of 45.7%, which resulted from the less favourable sales mix for 2017. This year the lower margin system sale contract revenues of GlobeOSS comprised a much greater proportion of our Group revenue.

Group profit before tax came in at S$2.8 million for the year, 62% lower compared to the S$7.4 million recorded for 2016. Although our Group bottom line benefitted from the better performance of GlobeOSS this year, the absence of a significant fair value gain on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio that was enjoyed in 2016 had resulted in a much lower profit before tax for our Group for 2017.

# Balance sheet strength and dividends

In the last quarter of 2017, each of our venture investments was appraised and in this process, several were fair-valued with a different valuation model that was assessed as being more appropriate under the circumstances than what was employed in previous periods. We continued to have a strong balance sheet at year-end 2017 with zero borrowings and ample cash and cash equivalents of S$7.4 million. This was also after declaring and paying to shareholders a dividend for the eighth year running. We had on 12 September 2017, paid a tax-exempt interim dividend of 2.5 Singapore Cents per share, in-line with the dividend per share paid in 2016.

# In gratitude

Our 10th consecutive year of profit but lower ROE. 2017 represented our tenth consecutive year of profitability. However as a result of the decline in bottom-line performance, our Group’s return on equity (ROE) was reduced to 3.2% this year from 15.7% the year before.

# Flat system sale contract revenues and improved managed service contract performance this year

Efforts to grow the managed service business persisted in 2017 proved to be a broadly positive year for our Group. We ended the year with improved revenue and operating profit results courtesy of a strong year at GlobeOSS and the early results of the PostPay business at Unifiedcomms. Unfortunately, the venture investment activities at Captii Ventures did not yield any realised or fair value gain this year to contribute to our overall Group bottom line.

We look forward to doing better in the year ahead and will strive to deliver an improvement in Group financial performance for 2018.

# Annual Report 2017

# Executive Chairman’s Letter

For the year that was, I extend my deepest gratitude to the talented and dedicated individuals across all the businesses that make up our Group, for your commitment and perseverance. I ask the same from you again in the new financial year ahead, to move our business onward and upward. To you, our shareholder, I thank you for your continued belief and patience in our people and our business. Last but certainly not least, my thanks go to the government agencies and regulatory bodies for their guidance and support.

# Annual Report 2017

# Management Discussion and Analysis

An overview of our business Unifiedcomms recorded a 4.5% decline in sales, turning in total revenue of S$11.7 million in 2017 versus S$12.3 million the year before.

Our Group comprises three main segments: Unifiedcomms, GlobeOSS and Captii Ventures.

Throughout 2017, our Unifiedcomms business continued to address mobile network operators and integrated telecoms service providers with application and platform software, turnkey solutions and systems and a variety of professional and managed services. In 2016 a unit within Unifiedcomms called PostPay (formerly Mobilization) was revitalised into a fresh start-up and given prominence as part of a wider reorganisation of the Unifiedcomms business. PostPay now focuses mainly on providing advanced solutions for prepaid credit on a managed service model.

| |2016|2017|
|---|---|---|
|Unifiedcomms|12,277|11,719|
|GlobeOSS|10,982|13,088|
|Others|193|-|

GlobeOSS meanwhile, continued to grow from strength to strength into Malaysia’s leading systems integration and solution provider in the telecoms big data and analytics field. Unifiedcomms operates primarily in the telecoms-tech markets of three regions: South East Asia (SEA), South Asia (SA) and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) while GlobeOSS focuses exclusively on SEA. For Unifiedcomms, with the exception of Malaysia, Singapore and Pakistan, where engagement with the customer is conducted directly by our own personnel, the majority of our engagements with customers are carried out through various sales channel partners. This two-tier sales and distribution approach enables us to cost-effectively reach customers within each region of focus and to tap into the local knowledge and insights of our partners to build and deliver compelling solutions.

Lower revenue at Unifiedcomms was caused by revenue from system sale contracts declining sharply to S$1.2 million in 2017 from S$2.5 million in 2016. Unifiedcomms managed service revenues improved from S$9.7 million to S$10.5 million but the growth achieved was not enough to offset the sharp decline in system sale revenues. The PostPay (formerly Mobilization) unit within the Unifiedcomms business that focuses on amongst others, advanced prepaid credit solutions on a managed service model continued to show very good progress in 2017 and achieved significant growth. The growth achieved was unfortunately not sufficiently large to countervail the slow growth or decline in other managed service contracts.

| |2016|2017|
|---|---|---|
|System Sales|2,539|1,187|
|Managed Services|9,738|10,532|

Captii Ventures, the venture investment arm of our Group, focuses primarily on the SEA market for start-up investment opportunities. Our venture investment business regularly interacts with other venture capital (VC) management companies in the region and participates in funding rounds as either lead investor or as a co-investor following the lead investor. In 2017 Captii Ventures added four new investees to its portfolio of start-up investments while also supporting the ten existing investees from 2016 in realising the development plans for their business.

As at end-2017, there are a total of 168 people that are employed in our businesses. The majority of these personnel are located in Malaysia, where our operational headquarters is situated, while the rest work out of Singapore, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Generally a positive year for Group revenue, but mixed for business segments. The 2017 financial was a positive year for our business in terms of Group revenue growth but a mixed one when we examine the performance of each of our business segments. The Group achieved consolidated revenue of S$24.8 million for the financial year 2017, an increase of 5.8% as compared to the S$23.5 million recorded in the previous year. Only one of our business segments however, showed an increase in their 2017 revenues.

GlobeOSS delivered an improvement in both system sale and managed service contract revenues in 2017. System sales increased significantly by 19.4%, from S$8.7 million in 2016 to S$10.4 million in 2017, while managed service revenue...

# Annual Report 2017

# Management Discussion and Analysis

increased by 18.2%, from S$2.3 million in 2016 to S$2.7 million in 2017.

SEA once again served as the principal driver for the improvement in Group revenue for the year, growing by 8.3% or S$1.8 million against last year’s contribution. The region that turned in a disappointing performance was MEA, which had its contribution fall from S$0.9 million to S$0.4 million. The SA region’s contribution to the total Group revenue maintained at S$0.8 million this year.

# GlobeOSS Revenue by Type of Contract (S$000)

|2016|8,669|2,313|
|---|---|---|
|2017|10,354|2,734|
| |System Sales|Managed Services|

GlobeOSS continues to also have both its system sale and managed service business concentrated in the SEA region. The S$2.1 million increase in revenue from the SEA region is driven by the S$1.7 million increase in system sales and a S$0.4 million improvement in managed service revenues between 2016 and 2017.

# Revenue by Geographical Regions (S$000)

|2016|21,751|833|851|17|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|2017|23,546|800|445|16|
| |SEA|SA|MEA|Others|

In 2017, SEA, our Group’s home region, continues to be the largest geographic source of revenue, accounting for 94.9% of Group revenue.

Lower gross profit, in contrast with higher revenue achieved. In spite of the higher consolidated revenue of S$24.8 million for 2017, representing a 5.8% gain on 2016 revenue, absolute gross profit achieved for the year was lower compared to 2016. Group gross profit for 2017 was S$11.3 million, down by S$1.1 million or 9.2% against what was recorded in 2016. Gross profit grew slower than revenue due to the sales mix achieved in 2017 – where the typically lower gross profit margin GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues accounted for the majority of the improvement in Group revenue. This, by extension, acted to reduce the overall gross profit margin earned on Group consolidated revenue to 45.7% as compared to 53.2% achieved the year before.

# Revenue by Type of Contract (S$000)

|2016|11,208|12,244|
|---|---|---|
|2017|11,541|13,266|
| |System Sales|Managed Services|

We expected 2017 to be a challenging year for Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS on the system sale front. However contrary to earlier expectations, market conditions improved in the second half of the year for the GlobeOSS business. Coupled with improved success rates for sale opportunities, significant growth in GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues was delivered in the second half of the year. Our Unifiedcomms business did not fare as well and recorded a sharp decline in system sale revenues.

# Gross Profit Margin by Type of Contract (%)

| |2016|2017|

|System Sales|45.5%|35.6%|
|Managed Services|60.3%|54.5%|

# Operating Expenditure before Exceptional Items (S$000)

| |2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Operating Expenditure|8,614|8,592|8,374|8,205|8,700|

Although system sale contract revenues grew this year, the sales mix of our Group continues to meet our target of having greater than fifty percent of Group revenue being derived from managed service contracts. This year managed service contract revenues accounted for 53.5% of Group revenue, up from 52.2% in 2016.

Higher total opex this year, before and after exceptional items

Our Group’s operating expenditure for the year increased to S$8.7 million as compared to S$8.3 million in 2016.

In 2016, we had a foreign exchange loss due to the strengthening of the US Dollar against the Malaysia Ringgit and impairment losses on certain plant and equipment, investment property and intellectual property assets to take into our income statement.

This year we had a fair value loss assessed on venture investment portfolio and a higher foreign exchange loss as a result of unfavourable exchange rate movement of US Dollar, Malaysia Ringgit and Pakistan Rupee against the Singapore Dollar. The fair value loss, which is unrealised, is a result of lower estimated fair valuation of the venture investment portfolio following the adoption of the most appropriate valuation techniques.

# Reduced bottom line, both organic and from investments

2017 marks our tenth consecutive year of being in the black. Group net profit for the year, at S$2.3 million, is 64.4% lower than the S$6.5 million recorded in 2016. This substantial decrease in our Group’s bottom line reflects the absence of any fair value gain on investment that we enjoyed in 2016 on the revaluation of the Captii Ventures investment portfolio. In 2016 this fair value gain amounted to S$2.4 million.

When the bottom line numbers are examined more closely, to exclude exceptional gains such as the fair value gains enjoyed on the acquisition of Ahead Mobile across 2012 and 2013 and in the revaluation of the Captii Ventures investment portfolio in 2016 and 2017, the profit performance of the Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS business is made more apparent. The ‘adjusted’ net profit generated by these two businesses declined by almost half, from S$4.0 million in 2016 to S$2.5 million this year.

# Net Profit before Fair Value Gain (S$000) & Net Profit Margin before Fair Value Gain (%)

| |2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Net Profit|9,524|9,003|8,733|8,390|8,320|

Excluding the effect of exceptional items such as the impairment loss this year, our opex for 2017 was S$0.5 million lower at S$8.4 million compared to S$7.9 million for 2016. This increase was due to the higher foreign exchange loss recorded in 2017.

In terms of bottom line margins, our Group recorded a net profit margin of 9.3% for 2017 versus 27.5% for 2016. If the effect of any fair value gain or loss is removed, our Group net profit margin for 2017 would increase to 9.9% while our 2016 results would reduce to 17.1%.

# Annual Report 2017

# Management Discussion and Analysis

Profit for the Year (S$000) & Net Profit Margin (%) Because of the lower net profit delivered in 2017, our Group’s return on equity (ROE) for the year dropped sharply to 3.2% from the 15.7% achieved in 2016. This single-digit outcome for 2017 was certainly an unwelcome one after an encouraging 2016. Of course the positive outcome of 2016 was aided by the outsized contribution from the fair value gain on the venture investment portfolio that year. Without the benefit of this gain from our venture investment portfolio we certainly would have had a much lower ROE for 2016.

| |2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Profit for the Year (S$000)|6,459|2,255|3,002|1,100|2,300|
|Net Profit Margin (%)|10.4%|15.6%|6.3%|9.3%|27.5%|

The flow-down effect of the improvement in Group net profit before and after exceptional items and fair value movements is very clearly reflected in our EBITDA results for the year.

| |2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|EBITDA (S$000)|37,055|35,884|34,556|33,573|32,273|

This year the contribution of system sale contracts was considerably higher, arising from significant growth in revenue performance of GlobeOSS. Managed service contracts showed steady revenue growth across both businesses. With the performance of our businesses being maintained if not improved further in 2018, we are optimistic of our being able to also further extend our dividend payout track record – to at minimum, maintain the dividend per share that was paid to all shareholders.

EBITDA dropped to S$3.7 million in 2017, a decrease of 55.2%, in tandem with the 64.4% decrease in net profit. A significant proportion of this EBITDA decrease is accounted for by the absence of any fair value gain on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio this year, as explained earlier. Removing the effect of this significant non-cash item in 2016, and also excluding exceptional items for the year, a clearer picture of the cash generation performance at our underlying business can be obtained. EBITDA before exceptional items and fair value gain stood at S$4.1 million for 2017 – still strongly positive but a 29.4% decrease against what was achieved in 2016.

Investing in (external) technology and innovation As at end-2017, we continued to have more than sufficient capital to augment our organic growth plans with growth by strategic investment. This remains an essential element of our current business plan that targets sustained, double-digit Group profit growth and a significant uplift of our ROE performance.

Throughout 2017, our venture investment business persisted in identifying and evaluating many investment opportunities in the SEA region. As a direct result of these efforts by the Captii Ventures team, as at end-2017, we have a total of fourteen investments in new technology ventures and start-ups. Out of these fourteen investments, four were made during the year.

# Reviewing our 2017 balance sheet positions

Now to turn to our Group’s balance sheet as at the end of the 2017 financial year: we ended 2017 with higher current assets of S$27.8 million, as compared to S$26.8 million as at end-2016. This was mainly attributable to the increase in trade and other receivables from S$17.3 million to S$20.1 million as a result of higher revenue achieved by the Group in respect of major system sales contracts that were awarded to and billed.

| |2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|EBITDA before Exceptional Items & Fair Value Effect (S$000)|5,769|5,206|4,071|4,543| |

# Annual Report 2017

# Management Discussion and Analysis

by the GlobeOSS business late in 2017. This, together with the rise of other financial assets (classified under non-current assets) namely S$2.8 million in cash being been utilised during the year on investments by Captii Ventures, gave rise to the decrease of the cash and cash equivalents at year-end.

We expected system sale market conditions to continue to be somewhat challenging for our Group in 2017 and for our managed service contract portfolio to deliver significant growth. This proved not to be the case this year yet again as GlobeOSS managed to secured a substantial increase in system sale contract revenues and steady growth in managed service contract revenues in spite of the competitive operating environment. Several hard-fought and won system sale contract opportunities during the year resulted in the significant revenue growth achieved by this business segment this year yet again. However, this improvement in revenue performance came at the expense of thinning margins. Unifiedcomms meanwhile managed to return managed service contract revenues to 2015 levels after a decline in 2016, courtesy largely of the outperformance of the PostPay business. This outperformance at PostPay had more than offset to the underperformance of certain other managed service contracts within Unifiedcomms.

# Cash and Cash Equivalents (S$000)

|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|13,450|11,248|11,880|9,055|7,391|

Although the growth in system sale business of GlobeOSS in 2017 had significantly augmented the slower than desired growth of our Group’s managed service contract portfolio, uncertainty and hence lumpiness is still to be expected in the contribution of system sale contracts to our Group’s future results. The need for our Group to continue to strengthen our managed service contract portfolio and to continue to grow our venture investment portfolio as the basis for delivering steady, if not rapid yet sustainable future growth, remains.

Our total non-current assets increased from S$23.1 million as at 31 December 2016 to S$26.2 million as at 31 December 2017. This increase was mainly due to the increase in investments by Captii Ventures which are classified as other financial assets. This increase was however partly offset by the non-cash fair value loss assessed on the venture investment portfolio as at end-2017, as well as on-going depreciation charges on plant and equipment.

Total liabilities of our Group as at 31 December 2017 increased from S$11.6 million to S$13.8 million. This increase was mainly due to the higher cost of sales incurred related to the system sale awarded in late 2017 by the Group in 2017. In terms of debt, we continued to be debt free at the close of the 2017 financial year.

# Reviewing movements in Group cash

Our Group’s net cash flows generated from operations for 2017 was S$3.8 million, an increase of 248.8% as compared to the net cash flows generated from operations of S$1.1 million in the previous year. This significant increase was mainly attributable to lower working capital incurred of S$0.2 million for 2017, as compared to S$4.7 million for 2016. The lower working capital incurred this year was mainly contributed by higher collection related to trade receivables from late 2016.

Our Group’s net cash used in investing activities for 2017 amounted to S$3.8 million, an increase of 11.1% as compared to the S$3.4 million invested in the previous year. The higher net cash used in investing activities this year is attributable to the higher investment cost made in the plant and equipment invested for new managed service contracts.

# Challenges and opportunities in 2018 and beyond

Apart from the contribution of existing long-standing managed service contracts, the bulk of the system sale revenues that are expected to be realised by our businesses in 2018 are expected to be driven by new solution implementation for new and existing customers, as well as solution enhancement, system upgrade and system capacity expansion activities of existing customers within the SEA and MEA region. The SEA and SA regions are meanwhile expected to drive managed service contract revenue growth.

Our Group’s managed service contract portfolio continues to have emphasis in our Group’s 2018 business plan. Group and business-segment level management will continue to work on means to better manage execution risk in respect of our strategies and tactics to grow. This includes maintaining if not growing the more mature managed service contracts in our portfolio and to more quickly translate secured contracts into substantial sources of recurrent revenue for our Group.

The growing interest and opportunity in internet-driven application services for enterprises, fintech as well as internet and handset-app delivered digital media will guide our Group’s venture investment activities.

The Group’s venture investment plan in the year ahead will continue to focus primarily on these growth businesses in the SEA region and will complement the organic growth strategy in place for our Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS businesses.

# Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance

The Board currently comprises five (5) directors, all of whom, except for the Executive Chairman and Executive Director, are non-executive and two (2) of whom are independent. The directors in office at the date of this report are disclosed within Table B above.

The Board is supported by various committees, namely the Audit Committee (“AC”), the Nominating Committee (“NC”) and the Remuneration Committee (“RC”) whose functions are also described below.

As the Executive Chairman is part of the management team, the Board has reviewed the percentage of Independent Directors on the Board and in the process of identifying suitable candidates to comply with the guideline stated in the Code which requires Independent Directors to make up at least half of the Board.

The criterion for independence is based on the guidelines stated in the Code. The Board considers an “Independent” director as one who has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its 10% shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgment with a view to the best interests of the Company.

# Annual Report 2017

# Captii Limited

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The independence of the Independent Director is subject to the NC’s annual review, based on the guidelines stated in the Code, in particular the rigorous review on the continued independence of Independent Directors who have served for more than nine (9) years from the date of their first appointment.

1. exercising control over quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information between management and the Board;
2. ensuring compliance with the Company’s guidelines on corporate governance; and

In respect of each of the two (2) Independent Directors, namely Phuah Peng Hock and Chuah Seong Phaik having served more than nine (9) years, the Board has considered specifically their length of service and their continued independence. The Board determined that the Independent Directors remained independent in character and judgment, and that there were no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director’s judgment. The Board is of the opinion that their length of service has not, in anyway, affected their independence.

Referring to all other directors who have served beyond nine (9) years, the Board does not consider the requirement of their retirement (if any) to be in the best interests of the Company.

The Board is able to exercise objective judgment independently from management and no individual or small group of individuals dominate the decisions of the Board. The Board is of the opinion that, given the scope and nature of the Group’s operations, the present size of the Board is appropriate for effective decision making. The Board is made up of directors of both gender and who are qualified and experienced in various fields including sales, engineering, business administration, general management, accountancy and finance.

The Non-Executive and Independent Directors are involved in reviewing the corporate strategies, business operations and practices of the Group, and are also involved in reviewing and monitoring the performance of management in achieving agreed goals and objectives.

Where necessary, the Non-Executive and Independent Directors meet without the presence of Executive Directors or management.

# Principle 3: Chairman and Executive Director

Wong Tze Leng (“Tze Leng”) is the Executive Chairman of the Board and Anton Syazi Ahmad Sebi (“Anton”) is the Executive Director of the Company. They are not related to each other. The Board having considered the number of Non-Executive and Independent Directors on the Board, as well as the size and scope of the affairs and operations of the Group, is of the view that its current structure has a strong independent element which enables the independent exercise of objective judgment on corporate affairs of the Group. This is reinforced by the establishment of the various Committees of which both Tze Leng and Anton are not members.

As the Chairman of the Board, Tze Leng is responsible for providing leadership to the Board and ensuring that the Board functions effectively. He is also responsible for, among others;

# Principle 4: Board Membership

The NC has adopted guidelines for annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of the contribution of each individual director to the effectiveness of the Board and has performed the necessary assent for the financial year.

Where a vacancy arises under any circumstances, or where it is considered that the Board would benefit from the services of a new director, the NC, in consultation with the Board, will review the composition of the Board, including the mix of expertise, skills and attributes of existing directors, so as to identify needed and/or desired competencies to supplement the Board’s existing attributes. Where it deems necessary or appropriate, the NC may seek assistance from external search consultants for the selection of potential candidates. After the NC Chairman, the Chairman of the Board and the other NC members have interviewed the candidates, the candidates are shortlisted for the NC’s formal consideration for appointment to the Board.

Where a director has multiple board representations, the NC will evaluate whether or not a director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his or her duties as director of the Group. The maximum number of listed company representations which any director may hold is set to be not more than five (5). Currently there is no alternate director appointed to the Board.

The profile that comprises key information of each of the directors is provided in page 13 to 14 of this Annual Report.

The independence of each director is reviewed annually by the NC based on the Code’s definition of what constitutes an Independent Director. Based on this review, the NC confirms the independence of the directors concerned.

The NC has reviewed the training needs for the directors in 2017 and encouraged directors to attend the relevant training courses that could enhance their knowledge to perform their duties as directors of the Company.

In presenting the quarterly and annual financial statements and announcements of financial results to shareholders, it is the aim of the Board to provide shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Company’s and the Group’s performance, position and prospects. Management will provide the Board with appropriately detailed management accounts of the Company’s performance, position and prospects on a quarterly basis.

The Board also ensures full disclosure of material information to shareholders in compliance with statutory requirements and the Listing Manual of SGX-ST.

# Principle 11: Risk Management and Internal Controls

The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the interests of the shareholders and the Group’s assets.

The Board and management assume the responsibility of the risk management function through the regular management review on the Group’s business and operational activities. The Board determines the nature and extent of the significant risks which the Board is willing to take, as well as appropriate measures to mitigate these risks.

The Group’s system of risk management and internal controls provides reasonable and adequate assurance that the Group will not be adversely affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives.

The Board, with the assistance of the AC will ensure that a review of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls and risk management system, is conducted annually. In this respect, the AC will review the audit plans, and the findings of the external and internal auditors and will ensure that the Company follows up on recommendations raised by both the internal and external auditors, if any, during the audit process. The Company will continue to make efforts in improving its risk management practices and internal control system.

The Audit Committee (“AC”) comprises:

- Chuah Seong Phaik (Chairman)
- Phuah Peng Hock (Member)

The AC is also authorised to investigate any matter within its terms of reference. It has full access to and the cooperation of management and the full discretion to invite any director or executive officer to attend its meetings, and reasonable resources to enable it to discharge its functions properly. The AC has undertaken a review of all non-audit services provided by the external auditors and in the AC’s opinion, the provision of these services does not affect the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and is pleased to recommend their re-appointment.

The fees paid to the external auditors for financial year ended 31 December 2017 amounted to S$142,000 and S$26,000 for audit and non-audit services respectively.

The Group has appointed different auditors for its overseas subsidiaries. The Board and the AC have reviewed the appointments of different auditors for its overseas subsidiaries and are satisfied that the appointments of different auditors would not compromise the standard and effectiveness of the audit of the Group. The Company is in compliance with Rules 712, 715 and 716 of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST.

The Group has implemented a whistle blowing policy adopted by the Board. The policy provides an avenue for staff of the Group to raise concerns on any possible misconduct in the Group or improprieties in relation to financial reporting and other matters.

The AC members keep abreast of changes to accounting standards and issues which have a direct impact on financial statements, through advice sought, updates and briefing from management and internal auditors, and the external auditors when they attend the AC meetings half yearly.

# Principle 13: Internal Audit

The function of internal audit is outsourced to a professional internal audit firm. The internal auditor (“IA”) reports principally to the AC Chairman.

The AC approves the engagement, termination, evaluation and compensation of the IA.

The IA provides independent appraisal and assurance for the review of the operations within the Group in order to support the AC in fulfilling their oversight responsibility. The purpose is to evaluate and contribute to the improvement of risk management, control and governance systems of the Group.

The IA adopts a risk-based approach in developing its audit plan based on the Group’s risk profile. The internal audit plan and the scope of internal audit are presented and approved by the AC on a yearly basis. Audit findings, recommendations and management’s corrective actions are reported regularly to the AC. The AC also reviews annually the adequacy and effectiveness of the IA to ensure that the IA has the capabilities to adequately perform its functions.

# Annual Report 2017

# Captii Limited

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

During the year, the IA has carried out its function according to the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of Internal Auditors, which includes operational and internal control reviews based on prioritised risk areas identified and appropriate steps have been taken by management to address the findings and recommendations.

All directors, including Chairman of the Board and respective Chairmen of the AC, NC and RC are present at general meetings to answer questions from shareholders. The external auditors are also present to assist the directors in addressing shareholders’ queries about the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of their auditors’ report.

# SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

# Principle 14: Shareholder Rights

# Principle 15: Communication with Shareholders

# Principle 16: Conduct of Shareholder Meetings

The Company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably, and does not practice selective disclosure. In line with the continuous obligations of the Company pursuant to SGX-ST’s Rules, the Board’s policy is that all shareholders should be equally informed of all major developments impacting the Group.

Information is disseminated to the shareholders on a timely basis through:

- SGXNET announcements and news releases;
- Annual Reports prepared and issued to all Shareholders; and
- Investor Relations website at captii.listedcompany.com where shareholders can access investor-related information on the Company.

Shareholders are given the opportunity to participate effectively in and vote at general meetings of shareholders. Shareholders are informed of the relevant rules and procedures that govern general meetings.

At general meetings, shareholders of the Company are given the opportunity to air their views and ask directors or management questions regarding the Company and the Group.

The Company’s Constitution allows a member of the Company to appoint not more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote on their behalf at general meetings. For the time being, the Board is of the view that this is adequate to enable shareholders to participate in general meetings of the Company and is not proposing to amend their Constitution to allow votes in absentia.

There is no provision in the Company’s Constitution that limit the number of proxies for a relevant intermediary which purchases shares on behalf of the CPF investors.

The Company ensures that there are separate resolutions at general meetings on each distinct issue. Each item of special business included in the notice of meetings will be accompanied by the relevant explanatory notes. This is to enable the shareholders to understand the nature and effect of each proposed resolution.

# Annual Report 2017

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Captii Limited (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (the “group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the group and the statement of financial position of the company as at 31 December 2017, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows of the group, and statement of changes in equity of the company for the reporting year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (“FRSs”) so as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and of the company as at 31 December 2017 and of the financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the group and of the changes in equity of the company for the reporting year ended on that date.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current reporting year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# a) Impairment testing of goodwill

Refer to Note 2A “Goodwill”, “Impairment of non-financial assets” and Note 2C “Estimated impairment of goodwill” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, and Note 15 “Intangible assets” for the key assumptions used in impairment testing of goodwill.

Goodwill amounted to $10.6 million and represented approximately 20% of the group’s total assets as at 31 December 2017. Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment. Management uses the value-in-use method to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill. The value in use calculation requires the group to estimate the future cash flows arising from the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. In estimating the future cash flows of the cash-generating unit, management forecasted the revenue, growth rates and margins based on presently available information.

We discussed with management the process over the determination of estimates for forecasted revenues, growth rates, profit margins, tax rates and discount rates. As the assessment process is complex and highly judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, our audit procedures included, among others, using our in-house valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the group. We assessed management’s estimates applied in the value-in-use models based on our knowledge of the CGUs’ operations, and compared them against historical forecasts and performance and industry benchmarks. Our in-house valuation specialists also performed a review of the management’s methodology, expectations and the discount rate used in the impairment assessment and tested the accuracy of the computations. We have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements.

# b) Fair value of unquoted investments

Refer to Note 2A “Fair value measurement”, “Financial assets” and Note 2C “Fair value of unquoted investments” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, Note 18 “Investment in an associate” and Note 19 “Other financial assets” for the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the unquoted investments.

Unquoted investments, comprised mainly of unquoted equity investments and unquoted debt securities amounted to $9.3 million and represented approximately 17% of the group’s total assets as at 31 December 2017. The fair value of majority of these financial assets are determined, with the assistance of external specialists, using valuation methodology that involved difficult and complex management’s judgments because these securities are not traded in an active market. As a practical expedient the fair value of the investment is regarded as fair value at Level 3. The determination of Level 3 prices is considerably more subjective given the lack of availability of market-based data. For investments acquired during the year where there is a lack of observable inputs, management considers various indicators where cost might not be representative of fair value.

# Annual Report 2017

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Key audit matters (cont’d)

# b) Fair value of unquoted investments (cont’d)

We discussed with management the basis used in determining the fair value, and evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies particularly for material illiquid financial instruments. The audit team was supported by our in-house valuation specialists to assess whether the valuations arrived at by the group were within a pre-defined reasonable range of acceptable differences. As part of these audit procedures, we assessed the reasonableness of key inputs used in the valuation, by benchmarking them with external data. We also determine whether such valuation methodology is consistent with market practice. Finally, we have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements.

# Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the statement by directors and the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and FRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.
3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

# Annual Report 2017

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont’d)

(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.

(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Lee Mong Sheong.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2017

# 1. General

Captii Limited (the “company”) is incorporated in Singapore with limited liability. It is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and they cover the company (referred to as “parent”) and its subsidiaries.

The board of directors approved and authorised these financial statements for issue on the date of the statement by directors.

The principal activities of the company are those of investment holding and the provision of management services.

The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 16 to the financial statements.

The registered office and principal place of business of the company is located at 140 Paya Lebar Road, #10-14 AZ@Paya Lebar, Singapore 409015.

# Accounting convention

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (“FRSs”) and the related Interpretations to FRS (“INT FRS”) as issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council and the Companies Act, Chapter 50. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except where an FRSs require an alternative treatment (such as fair values) as disclosed where appropriate in these financial statements. The accounting policies in FRSs may not be applied when the effect of applying them is not material. The disclosures required by FRSs need not be provided if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material. Other comprehensive income comprises items of income and expense (including reclassification adjustments) that are not recognised in profit or loss, as required or permitted by FRSs.

# Basis of preparation of the financial statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Apart from those involving estimations, management has made judgements in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies. The areas requiring management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed at the end of this note to the financial statements, where applicable.

# Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements made up to the end of the reporting year of the company and all of its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of the group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity and are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All significant intragroup balances and transactions, including income, expenses and cash flows are eliminated on consolidation. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the reporting entity obtains control of the investee and cease when the reporting entity loses control of the investee. Control exists when the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to gain benefits from its activities.

Changes in the group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for within equity as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. The carrying amounts of the group’s and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. When the group loses control of a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities and related equity components of the former subsidiary. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former subsidiary is measured at its fair value at the date when control is lost and is subsequently accounted as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with FRS 39.

The company’s separate financial statements have been prepared on the same basis, and as permitted by the Companies Act, Chapter 50, the company’s separate statement of comprehensive income is not presented.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information

# 2A. Significant accounting policies

Revenue recognition

The revenue amount is the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from the gross inflow of economic benefits during the reporting year arising from the course of the activities of the entity and it is shown net of any related sales taxes and rebates.

Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, there is neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold, and the amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Revenue from service contracts is recognised in accordance with the accounting policy on service contracts (see below).

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit, even if the payments are not on that basis.

Service contracts

When the outcome of a service contract can be estimated reliably, the revenue and costs associated with the contract are recognised in profit or loss by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the end of the reporting year, as measured by the portion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs method or the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work. The stage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs, as well as dependable measurement of the progress made towards completing a particular project.

Contract costs consist of costs that relate directly to the specific project, costs that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the project and such other costs that are specifically chargeable to the customer under the terms of the contract. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been agreed with the customer.

Recognised revenues and profits are subject to revisions during the project in the event that the assumptions regarding the overall project outcome are revised. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become likely and estimatable. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately. Certain work-in-progress projects have operating cycles longer than one year. The management includes in current assets amounts relating to the contracts realisable over a period in excess of one year.

When the outcome of a service contract cannot be estimated reliably: (a) revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that is probable will be recoverable; and (b) contract costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

Employee benefits

Certain subsidiaries have defined contribution retirement benefit plans in which employees are entitled to join upon fulfilling certain conditions. The entity contributes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the salary of each participating employee. Contributions are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. This plan is contributions to government managed retirement benefit plans such as the Central Provident Fund in Singapore and Employees Provident Fund in Malaysia which specifies the employer’s obligations which are dealt with as defined contribution retirement benefit plans. For employee leave entitlement the expected cost of short-term employee benefits in the form of compensated absences is recognised in the case of accumulating compensated absences, when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences; and in the case of non-accumulating compensated absences, when the absences occur. A liability for bonuses is recognised where the entity is contractually obliged or where there is constructive obligation based on past practice.

Foreign currency transactions

The functional currency of the company is the Singapore dollar as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. At each end of the reporting year, recorded monetary balances and balances measured at fair value that are denominated in non-functional currencies are reported at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year and fair value measurement dates respectively. All realised and unrealised exchange adjustment gains and losses are dealt with in profit or loss except when recognised in other comprehensive income and if applicable deferred in equity such as for qualifying cash flow hedges. The presentation is in the functional currency.

Translation of financial statements of other entities

Each entity in the group determines the appropriate functional currency as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the relevant reporting entity operates. In translating the financial statements of such an entity for incorporation in the consolidated financial statements in the presentation currency, the assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at the end of the reporting year rates of exchange and the income and expense items for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange for the reporting year. The resulting translation adjustments (if any) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of that relevant reporting entity.

Income tax

The income taxes are accounted using the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognised in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurements of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on provisions of the enacted or substantially enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current and deferred income taxes are recognised as income or as an expense in profit or loss unless the tax relates to items that are recognised in the same or a different period outside profit or loss. For such items recognised outside profit or loss the current tax and deferred tax are recognised (a) in other comprehensive income if the tax is related to an item recognised in other comprehensive income and (b) directly in equity if the tax is related to an item recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same income tax authority and entity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realised. A deferred tax amount is recognised for all temporary differences, unless the deferred tax amount arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which (i) is not a business combination; and (ii) at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). A deferred tax liability or asset is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the reporting entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the taxable temporary difference and it is probable that the taxable temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or for deductible temporary differences, they will not reverse in the foreseeable future and they cannot be utilised against taxable profits.

Plant and equipment

Plant and equipment are carried at cost on initial recognition and after initial recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Cost also includes acquisition cost, borrowing cost capitalised and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset or component to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequent costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss when they are incurred.

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to allocate the gross carrying amounts of the assets less their residual values over their estimated useful lives of each part of an item of these assets. The annual rates of depreciation are as follows:

|Computers, telecommunications, research and development equipment|–|3 to 5 years|
|---|---|---|
|Office equipment, furniture, motor vehicle and renovation|–|5 years|

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (cont’d)

# 2A. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

# Plant and equipment (cont’d)

An asset is depreciated when it is available for use until it is derecognised even if during that period the item is idle. Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of plant and equipment is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is recognised in profit or loss. The residual value and the useful life of an asset is reviewed at least at each end of the reporting year and, if expectations differ significantly from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate, and the depreciation charge for the current and future periods are adjusted.

# Investment property

Investment property is property owned or held under a finance lease to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes or sale in the ordinary course of business. It includes an investment property in the course of construction. After initial recognition at cost including transaction costs, the fair value model is used to measure the investment property at fair value on the existing use basis to reflect the actual market state and circumstances as of the end of the reporting year, not as of either a past or future date. A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment property is included in profit or loss for the reporting year in which it arises. The fair values are measured periodically on a systematic basis annually by external independent valuers having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued.

# Leases

Leases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased assets are classified as operating leases. For operating leases, lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit, even if the payments are not on that basis. Lease incentives received are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the total lease expense. Rental income from operating leases is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit, even if the payments are not on that basis. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Intangible assets

An identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance is recognised as an intangible asset at acquisition cost if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. After initial recognition, an intangible asset with finite useful life is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. An intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity.

The amortisable amount of an intangible asset with finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life from the point at which the asset is ready for use. The useful lives are as follows:

|Development costs|-|5 years|
|---|---|---|
|Intellectual property|-|5 years|

Development Costs – Development costs are typically internally generated intangible assets. Costs incurred in relation to individual projects are capitalised only when the future economic benefit of the project is probable and the following main conditions are met: (i) the development costs can be measured reliably, (ii) the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained and (iii) therefore it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.

Subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an entity including unincorporated and special purpose entity that is controlled by the reporting entity and the reporting entity is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that the reporting entity has the practical ability to exercise (that is, substantive rights) are considered when assessing whether the reporting entity controls another entity.

In the reporting entity’s separate financial statements, an investment in a subsidiary is accounted for at cost less any allowance for impairment in value. Impairment loss recognised in profit or loss for a subsidiary is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in a subsidiary are not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realised in a current market exchange.

Joint arrangement – joint venture

A joint arrangement (that is, either a joint operation or a joint venture, depending on the rights and obligations of the jointly controlling parties to the arrangement), is one in which the reporting entity is a party to an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control, which is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement; it exists only when decisions about the relevant activities (that is, activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a joint venture, the parties with joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The reporting interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method in accordance with FRS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.

In the consolidated financial statements, the accounting for investment in a joint venture is on the equity method. An investment in a joint venture includes goodwill on acquisition, which is accounted for in accordance with FRS 103 Business Combinations. However the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested under FRS 36 for impairment, by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value) with its carrying amount, whenever application of the requirements in FRS 39 indicates that the investment may be impaired. Under the equity method the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of the investee’s net assets. The carrying value and the net book value of an investment in the joint venture are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realised in a current market exchange. The investor’s profit or loss includes its share of the investee’s profit or loss and the investor’s other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the reporting entity’s interest in the relevant joint venture are not recognised except to the extent that the reporting entity has an obligation. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the reporting entity and a joint venture are recognised in the financial statements only to the extent of unrelated reporting entity’s interests in the joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the reporting entity. The reporting entity discontinues the use of the equity method from the date that when its investment ceases to be a joint venture and accounts for the investment in accordance with FRS 39 from that date. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former joint venture is measured at fair value at the date that it ceases to be a joint venture.

Associates

An associate is an entity including an unincorporated entity in which the reporting entity has a significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the reporting entity. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. An investment in an associate includes goodwill on acquisition, which is accounted for in accordance with FRS 103 Business Combinations. However the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested under FRS 36 for impairment, by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value) with its carrying amount, whenever application of the requirements in FRS 39 indicates that the investment may be impaired.

An investment in an associate is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss financial assets in accordance with FRS 39 (see note on financial assets below).

Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. There were no acquisitions during the reporting year.

Non-controlling interests

The non-controlling interest is equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the reporting entity as the parent. The non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the equity of the owners of the company. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (subsidiary) is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Where the non-controlling interest is measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and key model inputs used are disclosed in the relevant note. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is recognised as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (a) over (b); (a) being the aggregate of: (i) the consideration transferred which generally requires acquisition-date fair value; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with FRS 103 (measured either at fair value or as the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets); and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and (b) being the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with this FRS 103.

After initial recognition, goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, goodwill and also any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or any intangible asset not yet available for use are tested for impairment, at least annually. Goodwill impairment is not reversed in any circumstances.

For the purpose of impairment testing since the acquisition date of the business combination, goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree were assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than a segment.

Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

Impairment of non-financial assets

Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an annual impairment test is performed at about the same time every year on an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use. The carrying amount of other non-financial assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year for indications of impairment and where an asset is impaired, it is written down through profit or loss to its estimated recoverable amount. The impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount and is recognised in profit or loss.

The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. When the fair value less costs of disposal method is used, any available recent market transactions are taken into consideration. When the value in use method is adopted, in assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). At the end of each reporting year, non-financial assets other than goodwill with impairment loss recognised in prior periods are assessed for possible reversal of the impairment. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been measured, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Financial assets

# Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition:

A financial asset is recognised on the statement of financial position only when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The initial recognition of financial assets is at fair value normally represented by the transaction price. The transaction price for financial asset not classified at fair value through profit or loss includes the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or issue of financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss are expensed immediately. The transactions are recorded at the trade date.

Irrespective of the legal form of the transactions performed, financial assets are derecognised when they pass the “substance over form” based on the derecognition test prescribed by FRS 39 relating to the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership and the transfer of control. Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position if there is currently a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

# Subsequent measurement:

Subsequent measurement based on the classification of the financial assets in one of the following four categories under FRS 39 is as follows:

1. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Assets are classified in this category when they are incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term (trading assets) or are derivatives (except for a derivative that is a designated and effective hedging instrument) or have been classified in this category because the conditions are met to use the “fair value option” and it is used. All changes in fair value relating to assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised directly in profit or loss.
2. Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Assets that are for sale immediately or in the near term are not classified in this category. These assets are carried at amortised costs using the effective interest method (except that short-duration receivables with no stated interest rate are normally measured at original invoice amount unless the effect of imputing interest would be significant) minus any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectibility. Impairment charges are provided only when there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. The methodology ensures that an impairment loss is not recognised on the initial recognition of an asset. Losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised. For impairment, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. The amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Typically the trade and other receivables are classified in this category.
3. Held-to-maturity financial assets: As at end of the reporting year, there were no financial assets classified in this category.
4. Available-for-sale financial assets: As at end of the reporting year, there were no financial assets classified in this category.

# Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include bank and cash balances. For the consolidated statement of cash flows, the item includes cash and cash equivalents less cash subject to restriction that form an integral part of cash management.

# Financial liabilities

# Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition:

A financial liability is recognised on the statement of financial position only when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and it is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires. The initial recognition of financial liability is at fair value normally represented by the transaction price. The transaction price for financial liability not classified at fair value through profit or loss includes the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability. Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or issue of financial liability classified at fair value through profit or loss are expensed immediately. The transactions are recorded at the trade date.

# Subsequent measurement:

Subsequent measurement based on the classification of the financial liabilities in one of the following two categories under FRS 39 is as follows:

1. Liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: As at end of the reporting year, there were no financial liabilities classified in this category.
2. Liabilities at amortised cost: These liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Fair value measurement

When measuring fair value, management uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability under current market conditions, including assumptions about risk. It is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. The entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil a liability is not taken into account as relevant when measuring fair value. In making the fair value measurement, management determines the following: (a) the particular asset or liability being measured (these are identified and disclosed in the relevant notes below); (b) for a non-financial asset, the highest and best use of the asset and whether the asset is used in combination with other assets or on a stand-alone basis; (c) the market in which an orderly transaction would take place for the asset or liability; and (d) the appropriate valuation techniques to use when measuring fair value. The valuation techniques used maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise unobservable inputs. These inputs are consistent with the inputs a market participant may use when pricing the asset or liability.

The fair value measurements categorise the inputs used to measure fair value by using a fair value hierarchy of three levels. These are recurring fair value measurements unless stated otherwise in the relevant notes to the financial statements. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The level is measured on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the beginning of the reporting year. If a financial instrument measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, the price within the bid-ask spread or mid-market pricing that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances is used to measure fair value regardless of where the input is categorised within the fair value hierarchy. If there is no market, or the markets available are not active, the fair value is established by using an acceptable valuation technique.

The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. The fair values of non-current financial instruments may not be disclosed separately unless there are significant differences at the end of the reporting year and in the event the fair values are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements.

# 2B. Other explanatory information

Provisions

A liability or provision is recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A provision is made using best estimates of the amount required in settlement and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount recognised is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. Changes in estimates are reflected in profit or loss in the reporting year they occur.

Segment reporting

The reporting entity discloses financial and descriptive information about its consolidated reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. Generally, financial information is reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties

The critical judgements made in the process of applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting year are discussed below. These estimates and assumptions are periodically monitored to ensure they incorporate all relevant information available at the date when financial statements are prepared. However, this does not prevent actual figures differing from estimates.

Estimated impairment of goodwill

An assessment is made annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment loss, based on the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (“CGU”). The recoverable amounts of the CGUs was determined based on value in use calculations and these calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates as disclosed in Note 15C. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. The carrying amount of the group’s goodwill as at the end of the reporting year was $10,583,000 (2016: $10,295,000).

Impairment of intangible assets other than goodwill

An assessment is made of the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets, annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that trigger an impairment review include underperformance relative to historical or projected future results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. The carrying amount of intangible assets other than goodwill as at the end of the reporting year was $1,063,000 (2016: $1,287,000).

Development costs

Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established plan. Management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of profits. Should a project fail to substantiate its estimated feasibility or life cycle, material development costs may be required to be written-off in future periods. The carrying amount has been disclosed in Note 15.

Useful lives of plant and equipment

The estimates for the useful lives and related depreciation charges for plant and equipment is based on commercial and other factors which could change significantly as a result of innovations and in response to market conditions. The depreciation charge is increased where useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, or the carrying amounts written off or written down for technically obsolete items or assets that have been abandoned. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects. It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next reporting year that are different from assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the balances affected. The carrying amount of the class of assets as at the end of the reporting year affected by the assumption was $1,694,000 (2016: $1,288,000).

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties (cont’d)

# Allowance for doubtful accounts

An allowance is made for doubtful trade accounts for estimated losses resulting from the subsequent inability of the customers to make required payments. If the financial conditions of the customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required in future periods. To the extent that it is feasible impairment and uncollectibility is determined individually for each item. In cases where that process is not feasible, a collective evaluation of impairment is performed. At the end of the reporting year, the trade receivables carrying amount approximates the fair value and the carrying amounts might change materially within the next reporting year but these changes would not arise from assumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables as at the end of the reporting year was $20,061,000 (2016: $17,346,000).

# Contract work-in-progress

On long-term contracts, revenues are recorded on the stage of completion basis. The stage of completion is determined by dividing the cumulative costs incurred as at the end of the reporting year by the sum of incurred costs and anticipated costs for completing a contract. The stage of completion is then applied to the contract value to determine the cumulative revenue earned. This method of revenue recognition requires management to prepare cost estimates to complete contracts in progress, and in making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in scheduling, cost of materials, labour costs and productivity, the impact of change orders or liability claims. All known or anticipated losses based on these estimates are provided for in their entirety without regard to the stage of completion. These estimates are based on management’s business practices as well as its historical experience, and management regularly reviews underlying estimates of project profitability. The net carrying amount of the group’s contract work-in-progress as at the end of the reporting year was $2,347,000 (2016: -$1,492,000).

# Measurement of impairment of subsidiaries

When a subsidiary is in net equity deficit and has suffered operating losses, the recoverable amount of the investee is estimated to assess whether the investment in the investee has suffered any impairment. This measurement requires significant judgement. An estimate is made of the future profitability of the investee, and the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flows. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects. It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next reporting year that are different from assumptions could require adjustments to the carrying amount of the investments in subsidiaries. The carrying amount of the company’s specific assets at the end of the reporting year affected by the assumptions is $11,000,000 (2016: $11,000,000).

# Fair value of unquoted investments

If a financial asset is not traded in an active market or if the quoted price is not readily and regularly available, the fair value is established by using valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement requires the selection among a range of different valuation methodologies, making estimates about expected future cash flows and discount rates. The models are tested for validity by calibrating to prices from any observable current market transactions in the same instrument when available. Where cost is used as an estimate of fair value, significant judgement is required where management considers various indicators where cost might not be representative of fair value. The carrying amount of the classes of assets as at the end of the reporting year was $9,299,000 (2016: $7,189,000).

# Income tax amounts

The entity recognises tax liabilities and assets based on an estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items. Where the actual amount arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax amounts in the period when such determination is made. In addition management judgement is required in determining the amount of current and deferred tax recognised and the extent to which amounts should or can be recognised. A deferred tax asset is recognised if it is probable that the entity will earn sufficient taxable profit in future periods to benefit from a reduction in tax payments. This involves the management making assumptions within its overall tax planning activities and periodically reassessing them in order to reflect changed circumstances as well as tax regulations. As a result, due to their inherent nature assessments of likelihood are judgmental and not susceptible to precise determination. The income tax amounts are disclosed in Note 10.

# 4. Financial information by operating segments

# 4A. Information about reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities

Disclosure of information about operating segments, the geographical areas and the major customers are made as required by FRS 108 Operating Segments. This disclosure standard has no impact on the reported financial performance or financial position of the group.

For management purposes the reporting entity is organised into the three major strategic operating segments that offer different products and services. Such a structural organisation is determined by the nature of risks and returns associated with each business segment and it defines the management structure as well as the internal reporting system. It represents the basis on which the management reports the primary segment information that is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. They are managed separately because each business requires different strategies.

The segments and the types of products and services are as follows:

- Unifiedcomms – Segment for content-driven mobile value-added services (“VAS”), messaging and signaling systems, solutions and managed services.
- GlobeOSS – Segment for mobile network operation support systems, solutions and managed services.
- Captii Ventures – Segment for strategic investment in early and late-stage technology ventures.
- Others – Segment for investment holding and operational headquarters of the group.

Inter-segment sales are measured on the basis that the entity actually used to price the transfers. Internal transfer pricing policies of the reporting entity are as far as practicable based on market prices. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

The following tables illustrate the information about the reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities.

The group’s revenue can be divided into revenue generated from two types of contracts, as described below:

(a) System sales – this refers to contracts that involve the outright purchase by customers of systems comprising the group’s products and technologies, and where these systems are in turn delivered as turnkey solutions. The scope of work for a system sale contract includes system design, implementation, testing and commissioning services.

(b) Managed services – this refers to contracts that involve the provision of both systems comprising the group’s products and technologies as well as the group’s professional services, on a recurring, revenue sharing, software-as-a-service, pay-per-use or monthly or quarterly fixed and variable fee basis. Also treated as a managed service contract are system maintenance and technical support contracts with existing customers of the group, and an operating lease with a lessee.

Revenue of $9,709,000 (2016: $4,829,000) and $3,941,000 (2016: $4,412,000) are derived from two (2016: two) external customers. The former is attributable to the Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS business segments while the latter is attributable to the Unifiedcomms business segment.

The reconciliation of income taxes below is determined by applying the Singapore corporate tax rate where the company is situated. The income tax in profit or loss varied from the income tax amount determined by applying the Singapore income tax rate of 17.0% (2016: 17.0%) to profit or loss before income tax as a result of the following differences:

| |Group|2017|2016|

|Total income tax expense| |514|950|

There are no income tax consequences of dividends to owners of the company.

Two subsidiaries of the group in Malaysia, GlobeOSS Sdn Bhd and Unified Communications (VAS) Sdn Bhd, have been granted pioneer status as Multimedia Super Corridor (“MSC”) companies under the Malaysia Promotion of Investment Act, 1986. The benefits to a company having MSC status include a five year pioneer status tax exemption on profits generated from the MSC qualifying activities during the same period. The MSC status of GlobeOSS Sdn Bhd after being extended once, expired on 14 January 2017. The MSC status of Unified Communications (VAS) Sdn Bhd commenced from 21 December 2015 and will expire on 20 December 2020.

In addition, the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary company, Unified Communications (OHQ) Sdn Bhd received the Malaysia Industry Development Authority’s approval in October 2009 of its Operational Headquarters (“OHQ”) status to provide certain approved OHQ services to the group entities. This OHQ status is granted for 10 years with certain tax incentives which will expire in 2019.

# 11. Earnings per share

The following table illustrates the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share of no par value:

| |Group|2017|2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Profit, net of tax attributable to owners of the company| |$’000|$’000|
| |1,166|5,334| |

|Number of shares|2017|2016|
|---|---|---|
| |’000|’000|
|Weighted average number of equity shares|31,957|31,957|

The weighted average number of equity shares refers to share in circulation during the reporting year.

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit, net of tax attributable to owners of the company by the above weighted average number of ordinary shares.

Diluted earnings per share for the reporting years are computed using the same basis as basic earnings per share as there are no potential dilutive ordinary shares.

# 12. Dividends on equity shares

As at 31 December 2017, the strata title of the investment property has not been issued by Department of Director General of Lands and Mines in Malaysia.

There are no restrictions on the realisability of investment property or the remittance of income and proceeds on disposal.

The investment property was leased out in previous reporting years, and the lease was terminated in November 2016 upon expiry of the lease term.

The fair value of the investment property was measured in December 2017 based on the highest and best use method to reflect the actual market state and circumstances as of the end of the reporting year. The fair value was based on a valuation made by C H Williams Talhar & Wong, a firm of independent professional valuers, which hold a recognised and relevant professional qualification with sufficient recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year. Management determined that the highest and best use of the assets is the current use and that it would provide maximum value to market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets.

For fair value measurements categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, a description of the valuation techniques and information about the significant other observable inputs used in the fair value measurement are as follows:

Asset: Freehold property at Lot 3A-5-1, 5th Floor, Block 3A, Plaza Sentral, 50470, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

Fair value: $2,660,000 (2016: $2,588,000)

Valuation technique for recurring fair value measurements: Comparison with market evidence of recent transaction prices for similar properties.

Significant observable inputs: Price per square foot. $330 (2016: $321)

Sensitivity on management’s estimates – Impact – lower by $266,000 (2016: $259,000); higher by $266,000 (2016: $259,000).

There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year. The increase in fair value is due to foreign exchange adjustments during the reporting year.

# 15. Intangible assets (cont’d)

# 15C. Goodwill

Goodwill acquired through business combination has been allocated to Unified Communications Pte Ltd and its subsidiaries (see Note 16) and Ahead Mobile Sdn Bhd for impairment testing purpose. The carrying amount is disclosed above.

The goodwill was tested for impairment at the end of the reporting year. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit (“CGU’’) exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use. The recoverable amounts of the CGU have been measured based on the value in use method.

The value in use was determined by management using discounted cash flow valuation technique. The key assumptions used for value in use calculations, which are unobservable inputs, are as follows:

|Unobservable inputs|2017|2016|
|---|---|---|
|Estimated discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments at the risks specific to the CGU|12%|13.98%|
|Growth rates based on management estimate forecasts and not exceeding the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets|2%|2%|
|Cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans approved by management|5 years|5 years|

The value in use is a recurring fair value measurement (Level 3).

No impairment allowance was recognised because the carrying amount of CGU was lower than the recoverable amount.

Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which this division’s recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. If the estimated pre-tax discount rate applied to the discounted cash flows had been increased by 3% with other variables held constant, it would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

# 19C. Fair value measurements (Level 3) recognised in the statement of financial position

In the previous reporting year, the group has adopted the following valuation methodologies in estimating the fair values of the investments:

(a) Cost approach: This is applied to estimate fair value of companies in very preliminary development stage where revenue forecast is difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty, and assumes the book value or cost of an asset approximates its fair value. Adjustments, such as impairment allowance, are made to assets on a case-by-case basis if this assumption does not hold true.

(b) Recent transaction price: Recent transaction price and other business factors specific to the investee that may impact the investments fair value has been considered to estimate the fair value of the investment.

In the current reporting year, in addition to the above methodologies, the group also adopted the following valuation methodology in estimating the fair value of investments:

Option Pricing Model (OPM): The OPM, which applies the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing, is a generally accepted valuation methodology used in estimating fair values of early stage companies, in particular those with different classes of shares. In applying the OPM to determine the fair value of an investee, management considers terms such as level of seniority among the securities, dividend policy, conversion ratios, and cash allocations of the various stockholders’ agreements with the investee that would affect the distributions to each class of equity upon a liquidity event. In addition, the method implicitly considers the effect of the liquidation preference as of the future liquidation date, not as of the valuation date.

The key assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes formula in the current reporting year, which are unobservable inputs, are as follows:

|Unobservable inputs|2017|Sensitivity of inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|
|Risk free rates (range)|1.69% – 6.12%|Increase/(decrease) of the inputs would result in decrease/(increase) in fair values|
|Asset volatility (range)|38.02% – 60.0%| |
|Expected terms (years)|5 to 5.38| |

The group has the policy to regularly assess and evaluate the appropriate valuation methodologies in ascertaining the fair value of the investments.

Capital management:

The objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the reporting entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for owners and benefits for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to owners by pricing the sales commensurately with the level of risk. The management sets the amount of capital to meet its requirements and the risk taken. There were no changes in the approach to capital management during the reporting year. The management manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it where necessary or possible in the light of changes in conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the management may adjust the amount of dividends paid to owners, return capital to owners, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

In order to maintain its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange, the company has to have share capital with at least a free float of 10% of the shares. The company met the capital requirement on its initial listing and the rules limiting treasury share purchases mean it will continue to satisfy that requirement, as it did throughout the reporting year. Management receives a report from the share registrars frequently on substantial share interests showing the non-free float to ensure continuing compliance with the 10% limit throughout the reporting year.

Capital management: (cont’d)

The management does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to support its business and to add value for shareholders. The key discipline adopted is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed and the cost of that capital.

The group and the company did not have borrowings as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. Therefore, the debt-to-adjusted capital ratio does not provide a meaningful indicator of the risk of borrowings.

All reserves classified on the face of the statement of financial position as retained earnings represents past accumulated earnings and are distributable. The other reserves are not available for cash dividends unless realised.

# 30. Financial instruments: information on financial risks (cont’d)

# 30B. Financial risk management

The main purpose for holding or issuing financial instruments is to raise and manage the finances for the entity’s operating, investing and financing activities. There are exposures to the financial risks on the financial instruments such as credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk comprising interest rate, currency risk and price risk exposures. Management has certain practices for the management of financial risks and action to be taken in order to manage the financial risks. The guidelines include the following:

1. Minimise interest rate, currency, credit and market risks for all kinds of transactions.
2. Maximise the use of “natural hedge”: favouring as much as possible the natural off-setting of sales and costs and payables and receivables denominated in the same currency and therefore put in place hedging strategies only for the excess balance. The same strategy is pursued with regard to interest rate risk.
3. All financial risk management activities are carried out and monitored by senior management staff.
4. All financial risk management activities are carried out following acceptable market practices.
5. Consideration is given to investing in financial instruments in accordance with the investment strategy of the reporting entity.

There have been no changes to the exposures to risk; the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk.

The group and company are exposed to currency and interest rate risks. There are no arrangements to reduce such risk exposures through derivatives and other hedging instruments.

# 30C. Fair value of financial instruments

The analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These include the significant financial instruments stated at amortised cost and at fair value in the statement of financial position. The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

# 30D. Credit risk on financial assets

Financial assets that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk and failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations in full or in a timely manner consist principally of cash balances with banks, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk is: the total of the fair value of the financial assets; the maximum amount the entity could have to pay if the guarantee is called on; and the full amount of any payable commitment at the end of the reporting year. Credit risk on cash balances with banks is limited because the counter-parties are entities with acceptable credit ratings. Credit risk on other financial assets is limited because the other parties are entities with acceptable credit ratings. For credit risk on receivables an ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the debtors and a loss from impairment is recognised in profit or loss. The exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting limits on the exposure to individual customers and these are disseminated to the relevant persons concerned and compliance is monitored by management.

As part of the process of setting customer credit limits, different credit terms are used. The average credit period generally granted to trade receivable customers is about 30 to 90 days (2016: 30 to 90 days). But some customers take a longer period to settle the amounts.

(b) Ageing analysis of trade receivable amounts that are impaired as at the end of reporting year:

| |Group|2017|2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Trade receivables:|Over 9 months|6|25|

The allowance which is disclosed in Note 22 on trade receivables is based on individual accounts totalling $6,000 (2016: $25,000) that are determined to be impaired at the end of reporting year. These are not secured.

(c) At end of the reporting year, approximately 49% (2016: 58%) of trade receivables are due from three customers as follows:

| |Group|2017|2016|
|---|---|---|---|
|Top 1 customer| |4,939|3,372|
|Top 2 customers| |8,001|6,589|
|Top 3 customers| |8,950|9,525|

Other receivables are normally with no fixed terms and therefore there is no maturity.

# 30E. Liquidity risk – financial liabilities maturity analysis

There are no liabilities contracted to fall due after twelve months at the end of the reporting year. The liquidity risk refers to the difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. It is expected that all the liabilities will be settled at their contractual maturity. The average credit period taken to settle trade payables is about 30 to 60 days (2016: 30 to 60 days). The other payables are with short-term durations. The classification of the financial assets is shown in the statement of financial position as they may be available to meet liquidity needs and no further analysis is deemed necessary.

# 30F. Interest rate risk

The group and the company are not subject to significant interest rate risk exposure.

Sensitivity analysis:

|A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the exchange rate of the functional currency $ against Brunei dollars with all other variables held constant would have an adverse effect on profit before tax of| |(13)|(82)|

The above table shows sensitivity to a hypothetical percentage variation in the functional currency against the relevant material non-functional foreign currencies. The sensitivity rate used is the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. For similar rate weakening of the functional currency against the relevant foreign currencies above, there would be comparable impacts in the opposite direction on profit or loss.

The hypothetical changes in exchange rates are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The sensitivity analysis is disclosed for each non-functional currency to which the entity has significant exposure at end of the reporting year. The analysis above has been carried out on the basis that there are no hedged transactions.

In management’s opinion, the above sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the foreign currency risks as the historical exposure does not reflect the exposure in future.

# 30H. Equity price risk

There are instruments in equity shares, related derivatives or similar instruments. As a result, such investments are exposed to both currency risk and market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities. The fair values of these assets and sensitivity analysis are disclosed in Notes 18 and 19.

(a) Undertaking to support subsidiaries with deficits

The company has undertaken to provide continued financial support to certain of its subsidiaries which have total accumulated losses in excess of the issued and paid-up capital as at 31 December 2017 amounting in aggregate to $1,761,000 (2016: $2,290,000) to enable them to continue to operate as going concerns and to meet their obligations as and when they fall due for at least 12 months from the end of the reporting year.

The company has also issued a financial guarantee to a bank for banking facilities granted to a subsidiary. The banking facilities are secured by fixed deposits of the subsidiary amounting to approximately $2,479,000 and covered by a personal guarantee of a director of the subsidiary and corporate guarantee of the company of $505,000 (2016: $491,000). As at the end of the financial year, the outstanding facilities covered by the guarantee were Nil (2016: Nil).

# 31. Contingent liabilities (cont’d)

# (b) Litigation

On 19 November 2013, Unified Telecom Private Limited (“UTPL”), a joint venture of Unified Communications Pte Ltd (“UCPL”), filed a petition to the High Court of Delhi, New Delhi in India under Section 9 of India Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to obtain interim relief on the protection of assets currently under the custody of a former customer, a mobile telecoms network operator and service provider in India (the “Telco”), and to deny the penalty claims by the Telco against UTPL.

The Telco had via a letter issued in July 2013 alleged that UTPL is liable for a sum of INR 10.7 crore (approximately $2.1 million) for damages and expenditure incurred in connection with the contract during its currency.

Legal advice has been sought from reputable law firms in both India and Singapore with good credentials in handling contract litigation and dispute resolution, to review and advise on the merit of this claim by the Telco on UTPL. Based on the legal opinions obtained from the law firm concerned, management is of the view that UTPL has full rights and title to the assets and should be entitled to demand their return, and that the Telco’s claim against UTPL has no legal merit. Accordingly, external legal counsels in Singapore and India have been appointed to advise and represent UCPL and UTPL to pursue legal recourse.

As announced by the company on 16 January 2015, the hearing on the petition filed by UTPL which was originally scheduled to be heard on 23 April 2014, having been adjourned on several occasions, was dismissed by the High Court, as the Telco had initiated the arbitration proceedings before a tribunal. The High Court was of the view that the matter should be resolved through arbitration proceedings since the tribunal had already been constituted.

During the reporting year 2015, UTPL commenced an application pursuant to Section 17 of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 for, amongst others, the return of the Hardware. However, the learned Arbitrator dismissed the application, but directed Telco to ensure the safety of and protect the Hardware from any damage during the period the Hardware is lying in Telco’s premises.

A number of procedural hearings have been held by the Arbitrator to cross examine the affidavits of the admissions and denial documents relating to the aforesaid claim and counterclaims. The Arbitrator has attempted to arrange for a next hearing but this was adjourned a few times with the date of the next hearing tentatively set on 18 April 2018.

In the opinion of management, no material losses are expected to arise pertaining to the aforesaid contingent matter.

# 32. Changes and adoption of financial reporting standards

For the current reporting year new or revised Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore and the related Interpretations to FRS (“INT FRS”) were issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council. Those applicable to the reporting entity are listed below. These applicable new or revised standards did not require any modification of the measurement methods or the presentation in the financial statements.

|FRS No.|Title|
|---|---|
|FRS 7|Amendments to FRS 7: Disclosure Initiative|
|FRS 12|Amendments to FRS 12: Recognition Of Deferred Tax Assets For Unrealised Losses|

# 33. New or amended standards in issue but not yet effective

Companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”) currently reporting under Singapore Financial Reporting Standards are required to comply with new financial reporting standards (issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council) that would be identical to the International Financial Reporting Standards for reporting years beginning on after 1 January 2018. The new framework is referred to as SG-IFRS. SG-IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards will be adopted in the financial statements when it becomes mandatory. Based on the current accounting treatment of the account balances management does not anticipate that the application of SG-IFRS 1 will have a material impact on the financial position and / or financial performance of the reporting entity.

Those applicable to the reporting entity for future reporting years are listed below.

|SFRS(I) No.|Title|Effective date for periods beginning on or after|
|---|---|---|
|SFRS(I) 1-28|Amendments to SFRS(I) 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Venture – Sale or Contribution of Assets|1 Jan 2018|
|SFRS(I) 1-40|Amendments to SFRS(I) 40: Transfer of Investment Property|1 Jan 2018|
|SFRS(I) 9|Financial Instruments|1 Jan 2018|
|SFRS(I) 15|Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Amendments to SFRS(I) 115: Clarifications to SFRS(I) 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers|1 Jan 2018|
|SFRS(I) 16|Leases and Leases - Illustrative Examples & Amendments to Guidance on Other Standards|1 Jan 2019|
|SFRS(I) INT 22|Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration|1 Jan 2018|
|SFRS(I) INT 23|Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments|1 Jan 2019|

SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments will replace FRS 39 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It contains requirements for the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, impairment, hedge accounting and derecognition. SFRS(I) 9 requires all recognised financial assets to be subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value (through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income), depending on their classification by reference to the business model within which they are held and their contractual cash flow characteristics. For financial liabilities, SFRS(I) 9 relates to cases where the fair value option is taken: the amount of change in fair value of a financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognised in other comprehensive income (rather than in profit or loss), unless this creates an accounting mismatch. For the impairment of financial assets, SFRS(I) 9 introduces an “expected credit loss” (“ECL”) model based on the concept of providing for expected losses at inception of a contract; recognition of a credit loss should no longer wait for there to be objective evidence of impairment. For hedge accounting, SFRS(I) 9 introduces a substantial overhaul allowing financial statements to better reflect how risk management activities are undertaken when hedging financial and non-financial risk exposures. The recognition and derecognition provisions are carried over almost unchanged from FRS 39.

On the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist as at 31 December 2017 (see accounting policy in Note 2 and disclosures in Notes 18 and 19) the entity does not anticipate that the application of the new standard will have a material impact on the financial position and/or financial performance of the entity, apart from providing more extensive disclosures on the entity’s financial instruments.

SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 replaces FRS 11, FRS 18 and the related Interpretations to FRS. It establishes a single and comprehensive framework for revenue recognition to apply consistently across transactions, industries and capital markets, with a core principle (based on a five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers), enhanced disclosures, and new or improved guidance (e.g., the point at which revenue is recognised, accounting for variable consideration, costs of fulfilling and obtaining a contract, etc.). SFRS(I) 15 will be adopted in the financial statements when it becomes mandatory and the full retrospective method of transition to the new standard will be used.

On the basis of the current accounting treatment of the major sources of revenue (see accounting policy in Note 2 and disclosures in Note 5 on revenue) the management does not anticipate that the application of SFRS(I) 15 will have a material impact on the financial position and/or financial performance of the entity, apart from providing more extensive disclosures on the revenue transactions. However, as the entity is still in the process of assessing the full impact of the application of SFRS(I) 15 on the financial statements, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable financial estimate of the effect until the detailed review is completed.
