As the well-being of our staff is critical to the Group, we strive to actively promote healthy work practices. Accordingly, employees above 40 years of age, who are provided with additional relevant allowance, are encouraged to do a yearly health check.

# ENVIRONMENT

Our Group recognizes the importance of good environmental management in order to preserve the environment. Below are some of our practices put in place as part of our work culture.

# Product Development and Production Stage

As part of our supply chain operations, we have to maintain the quality of materials used for production to ensure minimum adverse impact on the environment. All purchase orders issue to key suppliers must meet the prerequisites set out in Addvalue’s product quality requirements. Apart from the geographic location and green environment awareness, we need to consider factors that may influence our choice of supplier, including but not limited to the possible pervasive use of recycled parts by the supplier or whether the supplier is a qualified organization with environmental certification. With regard to improvement of environment, we commit to be as an environmental preservation organization. In this regard, we have started to send out yearly assessment forms in FY2018 to key suppliers for such evaluation.

Internally, as part of our work culture and to play a greater role in environmental protection, we encourage our product designers to adopt environmental friendly components across all product development stages. One of such first steps which we have adopted is to reduce the use of environmental unfriendly packing materials.

# Waste Management and Recycling

In our daily operations and as part of our work culture, we continue to be committed to recycle, re-use and reduce wastage.

In FY2018, we have started to replace all our light tubes in our Singapore office premises with the lower energy consumption LED light tubes.

Our employees are also encouraged to be environmentally conscious by promoting paperless administration as well as operational practices to reduce paper usage, minimize energy consumption and water wastage, specifically through the switching off of lights during lunch hours and when not in use; the switching off of power for equipment which is not in use; the re-use of recycled printed papers for internal documents; and double-sided printing.

Customers, business partners and vendors

The Group recognizes that its success is highly dependent on the supports from its customers, business partners and vendors as well as in having good and effective communications with fairness in business dealings with them. Communications with these stakeholders are generally conducted through the various channels, such as meetings, events like trade shows and partners’ conferences as well as emails, phone calls and tele-conferencing.

Manpower

As a technology based company where our core competency lies with our workforce, the ability to recruit, retain and enhance the competency of talents is key. Currently, the Group provides in-house training on product and technology competency; as and when necessary, it will also send the relevant staff for external courses to upgrade their competency level. A more structured training program will be put in place in due course.
