# About this report

This is the eighth annual Group Sustainability Report (SR2022) by Singapore Telecommunications Limited (Singtel) for the financial year 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 (FY2022), and published on 30 June 2022. It covers the Group’s strategies, initiatives and performance in relation to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics of our operations in Singapore, where Singtel is headquartered, and Optus, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia. All data, statistics and targets are in relation to the Group’s operations in Singapore and Australia unless stated otherwise. Group-level figures are in Singapore dollars, using the exchange rate of A$1 to S$0.99722.

No restatements were made from the previous report except electricity and Scope 2-related figures for Singtel and Singtel Group in 2021 in the Environmental Performance Indicators (page 25-26). We however retained key methodologies on our stakeholder engagement and materiality to provide context on our ambitions and actions that have not changed since our strategic reset in 2021. During the year, we made investments in four IT and digital services companies in Australia. There were no significant changes to our supply chain.

This report captures the highlights and achievements of FY2022 and should be read together with the Singtel Annual Report 2022, Singtel Sustainability and SR2022 webpages, and Optus Sustainability Report, which contain our corporate sustainability information and additional annexes like the GRI Index and EY assurance statement, as well as our inaugural standalone TCFD Report 2022.

# GRI, SASB and TCFD

This report has been prepared to be in line with the updated GRI Universal Standards 2021. It complies with SGX Listing Rule 711 (A) and (B) and incorporates SGX’s enhanced disclosures on climate-related information which was released in 2021 where applicable. It also contains our disclosures recommended by SASB based on the Telecommunications Services (Industry Standard, Version 2 18-10).

We endorsed the TCFD framework in 2017 and our TCFD Report 2022 presents a detailed discussion of our approach to climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets.

# External Assurance

We have engaged Ernst & Young LLP to independently assure a selection of our key ESG disclosures. The independent limited assurance statement (page 67-73) can be read here.

The assurance statement has details on material topics assured, assurance standards used and our procedures, methodologies and assumptions.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022

# Message from Chairman and Group CEO

2021 was a year of transformation and continuous adaptation. While competitive pressures accelerated in our key markets of Singapore and Australia, COVID-19 made the operating and business environment all that more challenging. As lingering COVID risks remain, we are also seeing the Ukraine conflict impact the global economy, people, businesses and supply chains.

In these tumultuous times, our new corporate purpose, Empower Every Generation, has guided us as we move beyond the current disruption and reinvent ourselves for the 5G era. Introduced last October alongside a set of refreshed core values, it underpins our strategy and reflects our focus on harnessing technology to empower people and businesses and create a more sustainable digital future.

Since we embarked on a reset of our business priorities as well as purpose, we have doubled down on efforts to build our digital core, optimise capital use and unlock value from our assets. We further built on our 5G leadership to reinvigorate our consumer and enterprise businesses, which will place us at the front and centre of this hyper-connected world. Our strategic reset also elevates the importance of people and sustainability, ensuring no one gets left behind, and sustainability is integrated across our network infrastructure and operations. We want to create sustained, purpose-driven impact and value as we embark on our growth areas.

In this eighth Singtel Group Sustainability Report 2022, endorsed by the Singtel Board and Management, we highlight efforts taken as we embraced our new purpose and sustainability framework and executed our digital strategy, and take stock of our progress and achievements against our five-year sustainability 2025 targets.

# Taking climate action

The Singtel Group continues to enhance and embed climate action and deliverables into our business plans. We were the first telco in Asia Pacific to establish a sustainability-linked bond framework in October last year to further align our financing approach with our sustainability strategy. The framework outlines individual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) that are core to our business, such as emissions reduction targets by 2025, which line up to our previously approved 2030 SBTi targets to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. These KPIs are also aligned to our management’s short and long-term incentive plans. Sustainability-linked financing, such as the A$300 million Optus sustainability-linked bond issued in November last year, provides investors with the opportunity to participate in our sustainability journey.

During the year, we also mobilised key business units including Networks, Property and Finance to further minimise our environmental footprint. In February this year, we announced that we will be redeveloping the Comcentre building, our corporate headquarters since 1979. The building design and construction of this site will be guided by sustainability principles and an end-to-end carbon neutral development, in support of our vision to forge a greener, sustainable future.

Renewable energy is an area of focus for the Singtel Group, and we appointed a sub-committee within our Management Committee to oversee our renewable energy and decarbonisation strategy. During the year, we awarded a contract for onsite solar photovoltaic deployment at up to eight of our Singapore facilities. The sites, which will be operational by end-2022, will bring our renewable energy in Singapore to ~5 GWh per annum. Energy sources for our Australian operations will also be backed by 100% renewable energy by end-2025. In addition, we retired 44 GWh of renewable energy certificates to lower our Scope 2 emissions across the Group, with more renewable plans in the pipeline to achieve our emissions targets.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022

# Our Sustainability Approach

To ensure the business continues to reduce emissions from our operations and factor in externalities such as carbon taxes, we piloted an internal carbon price at S$50 per tonne of carbon dioxide, which was applied to selected energy-intensive projects and business case analyses for our Singapore operations.

Climate risk assessment is an important part of our environmental strategy and the publication of the Group’s inaugural Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report demonstrates our commitment to provide transparency to stakeholders on how we are managing climate risk and addressing the transition to net-zero within our business. Singtel is one of a handful of progressive Singapore companies to publish a TCFD report, which includes findings from our detailed study on the physical and transition risks from different climate change scenarios in both Singapore and Australia and their financial impact on our business. You can read the report here.

# Community impact

Community impact is a key pillar of our sustainability framework, and we have built on our efforts to do more to support our communities. In support of our customers’ interest to engage in both social and environmental actions, we built on the success of Optus’ unique Donate Your Data programme that enables our customers to provide vulnerable people with mobile data access. During the year, we introduced a new Donate Your Device programme that provides vulnerable segments in Australia with devices.

We also extended Donate Your Data to Singapore through our all-digital mobile brand GOMO. We launched this in March 2022 and engaged our GOMO customers to contribute their unused data to support digitally excluded seniors in Singapore, and will expand this to the rest of our Singtel mobile customers. Donate Your Data complements our Singtel Digital Silvers programme, where our staff volunteers teach seniors how to go online safely.

# Keeping the momentum

The Singtel Group Sustainability Report 2022 is an opportune time to take stock of how far we have come. Our disclosures published in the report are testament to our good progress and achievements as we continue to be a responsible sustainability steward that positively impacts the diverse communities in the markets where we operate.

On behalf of the Singtel Board and Management, we thank you for your support.

As Asia’s leading communications technology company, the Singtel Group aims to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. We want to attract, develop and retain our people, connect and enrich the lives of our customers and community through innovation, and create a positive impact on our environment.

Under our strategic reset last year, we refreshed our sustainability framework comprising four sustainability pillars of Climate Change and Environment, People and Future of Work, Community Impact and Sustainable Value Creation to better align sustainability with our business strategies and how we engage our key stakeholders (see Figure 1).

Our Group purpose, Empower Every Generation, guides Singtel’s sustainability framework and our four sustainability pillars (see Figure 2).

Underpinning this is our focus on empowering our stakeholders, including our employees, customers, communities and suppliers, to create sustainable value and an equitable and inclusive future for all. This is supported by our six corporate values: Cultivate a growth mindset; Operate with integrity; Make customers first; Maximise teamwork; Innovate with a challenger spirit; and Take ownership, which form the mnemonic COMMIT, demonstrating our commitment to excellence, innovation and sustainability.

Our Group purpose and values serve as a compass to guide our strategy, governance, programmes and performance so that we deliver long-term business growth and value creation for stakeholders while delivering purpose and care for our people and the environment.

At the workplace, we want to empower our people to create sustainable and positive impact through the work they do. These refreshed core values will guide their daily.

# People and Future of Work

We empower our people by investing in their development and equipping them with future skills, while ensuring inclusive and meaningful employment to bring out the ‘Best of Me’ at the individual level and achieve the ‘Best of We’ collectively.

# Community Impact

We are committed to driving sustainable positive change for our communities by empowering the vulnerable through equity and inclusion, as well as digital enablement to provide equal opportunities and access for all, so that no one is left behind.

We empower the present generation to accelerate climate action and safeguard the planet to chart a sustainable future for generations to come. Underpinning this is our focus on empowering all our stakeholders, including our people, customers, communities, and suppliers to create sustainable value and an equitable and inclusive future for all.

We empower our community and stakeholders of all generations through responsible business practices across our operations and supply chains to drive positive business, environmental, and societal impact.

# Figure 2: Singtel Group Purpose and Sustainability Framework

Actions and support the development of a purpose-driven culture. For example, in alignment to our core value of operating with integrity, our people and workforce across our value chain are expected to behave responsibly and ethically. This is critical for building trust with stakeholders like customers, partners, communities, and fellow colleagues.

We also cultivate a growth mindset among our people by encouraging them to keep on learning so that they can perform effectively while adapting to the complexities in this ever-changing operating environment.

Our sustainability framework supports the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) which Singtel has been a signatory since 2007, our priority 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the global and local initiatives that Singtel Group is committed to. For example, we are a member of The Valuable 500 and a founding member of the Singapore Business Network on DisAbility (SBNoD) to advance the equitable inclusion of persons with disabilities.

Through our sustainability-linked financing, we also give investors an opportunity to participate in our sustainability journey. More details of our stakeholder engagement and expectations can be found on our Sustainability webpage.

# STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MATERIALITY

We engage our internal and external stakeholders through regular dialogue on an extensive range of topics using various platforms and feedback mechanisms. This is on top of our regular interim and formal materiality assessments. With a deep understanding of all our stakeholders – their changing needs and interests as well.

We conducted our last formal stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment in 2021 across Singapore and Australia. This exercise identified a list of material topics and issues that our stakeholders are most concerned with (see Figure 3). These key topics formed our areas of focus from FY2021 to FY2025.

# Materiality methodology overview

Our materiality assessment aimed to identify and assess the ESG issues, risks and opportunities in areas that mattered most to our stakeholders and the Singtel Group. It adopted a rigorous data-driven approach that evaluated both internal and external perspectives, using extensive landscape research and in-depth stakeholder insights, and involved four phases:

# 1. Risk sensing

We analysed a wide range of global and industry studies on current and future sustainability trends to identify long-term sustainability success factors. This included literature guidance from internationally recognised standards and resources like the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and the GSMA Sustainability Assessment Framework.

We conducted competitive benchmarking of global telecommunication peers’ sustainability goals and supported SDGs.

# 2. Stakeholder engagement

We obtained a detailed view of the ESG topics our stakeholders expected of the Singtel Group through direct engagement and feedback. We consulted close to 2,500 individuals from ten key stakeholder groups through online surveys and one-on-one interviews. Both internal and external stakeholders also evaluated our ESG performance and suggested areas for improvement.

# 3. Materiality workshop

The risk sensing and stakeholder engagement identified 19 material topics which were grouped into four main sustainability themes. These were validated at a materiality workshop with the sustainability teams at Singtel and Optus to ensure topic relevance and significance, and subsequently with the Singtel Management Committee and Board. In addition, we conducted supply chain sustainability and organisational life cycle assessments to identify direct and indirect environment and social impact as well as risks and opportunities across our business operations and value chain.

# 4. Material topic prioritisation

The 19 topics were plotted onto a materiality matrix based on the importance to stakeholders and significance to the Singtel Group. This gave us strategic clarity in responding to opportunities and risks, which we grouped into three clusters: Priority, Ongoing importance, Monitor and manage.

# SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE AT SINGTEL

Singtel Group is committed to implementing an effective governance structure to ensure that the entire business is aligned to sustainability and creating positive, long-term impact, guided by our Group purpose and sustainability framework. The various committees, including Board committees, oversee various aspects of our sustainability efforts to ensure that our actions are robust and rooted in integrity (see Figure 4).

Singtel Group complies with SGX’s new requirement for Directors to undergo mandatory sustainability training. Some of our Board of Directors have attended and the rest will be attending sustainability training courses on ESG Essentials and Sustainability E-Training for Directors offered by the Singapore Institute of Directors and Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants respectively.

# Management ESG KPIs

Given that many sustainability issues cannot be addressed overnight, our Top Executives have collective and common ESG targets representing 20% of their long-term incentive plans. These targets cut across key sustainability themes like climate change and responsible business practices as measured by MSCI, community impact in terms of our digital inclusion and enablement targets, and talent and people including diversity and talent retention. They include specific, time-bound key performance indicators (KPIs) such as reaching 32% of female employees in management by FY2025. This is to advance the sustainability agenda and embed deeper accountability and ownership across the company.

In addition, our Management Committee members have related ESG targets for their short-term incentive plans, which comprise 10% of their annual balance scorecard performance. While they relate to common sustainability themes, the focus and weightage may vary for each executive given their different levels of influence and impact on these ESG KPIs. The Management Committee’s KPIs are also cascaded down to their business units, departments and employees, whose performance bonus and other incentives are tied to their KPIs. The Singtel Board is the highest governance body. For more information on our Board and Board Committee roles in sustainability governance, refer to our website.

We also mapped our ten priority material topics and their relevance within our value chain, according to the impact we contributed or caused. This allowed us to visualise areas of impact that we could make within our business and supply chain. We also undertook a Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prioritisation exercise for Singtel Group using a weighted scoring system. The six priority SDGs (see Table 1) reflect where we can best contribute and create impact, aligned to our key focus areas and programmes.

# Our Sustainability Approach

Building a sustainable future for all requires the commitment and effort of all stakeholders in the ecosystem. SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals – therefore underpins our sustainability strategy as we seek to collaborate with our stakeholders to create shared value and positive impact.

Figure 1: Singtel Group Environmental Framework

The Singtel Group is committed to minimising our environmental impact and building operational resilience to deliver long-term value to our business, stakeholders and communities. Figure 1 outlines the Singtel Group Environmental Framework. We are also guided by our Environmental Management System and Environment Policy to manage and minimise our impact. Please refer to our website for more information.

During the year, we also aligned our approach with our Group purpose and mapped the values and behaviours against our sustainability framework. We want to empower the present generation to accelerate climate action and safeguard the planet to chart a sustainable future for generations to come. We aim to achieve the smallest environmental footprint and support communities adversely affected by climate-related disasters, collaborating with our partners and stakeholders in the ecosystem.

The world continues to witness the effects of climate change in the form of frequent extreme weather events like droughts, floods and heatwaves. Concerned with the reliability and resilience of our network infrastructure, our stakeholders are interested in our network adaptation measures for mitigating these risks.

This is particularly relevant in Australia which is prone to natural disasters. We are committed to ensuring that our network infrastructure remains resilient before and during a severe weather event. We also provide additional support to affected customers and communities.

# Maximising value creation with Singtel Group core values

|Values|Climate Change and Environment|
|---|---|
|C|Cultivate a Growth Mindset|
|O|Operate with Integrity|
|M|Make Customers First|
|M|Maximise Teamwork|
|I|Innovate with a Challenger Spirit|
|T|Take Ownership|

We learn, unlearn and relearn in an everchanging environment brought about by climate change, which poses increasing complexities and uncertainties. We operate sustainably and with integrity, as we have a moral obligation to meet the needs of the present generation without jeopardising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

We empower our customers to engage in positive environmental actions, and build resilience into our networks and operations to keep people connected and safe during times of natural disasters.

We collaborate among our business units and work closely with partners in our ecosystem to minimise our environmental impact.

We recognise that innovation is critical for the transition to net-zero and the importance of evaluating our business model, value proposition and operational practices to manage climate risks and opportunities through our decarbonisation and adaptation strategy.

We are committed to minimising our environmental footprint and building operational resilience for the long-term benefit of our business, communities and customers. For example, during the year, we responded promptly to the extensive floods that affected New South Wales and Queensland to maintain the availability of our network. Where our mobile sites were affected, we worked swiftly to restore services and deployed our portable infrastructure to boost mobile coverage at areas such as evacuation centres. We also provided additional free mobile data to customers in affected areas, set up a dedicated support hotline and contributed to flood relief efforts.

# CLIMATE ACTION

The topic of climate change and environment is an important agenda for the Singtel Group. We have been refining our approach in tackling both risks and opportunities of climate change over the years.

Since 2017, our climate strategy and targets have been developed and aligned with internationally recognised frameworks such as Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi). The various studies, analyses and exercises that we have conducted have been key to guiding our strategy in managing these risks and opportunities as the global climate agenda evolves.

We recognise stakeholders’ concern with our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from powering communication and connectivity through our telecommunications network and data centres. Hence we are putting a strong focus on reducing emissions through energy efficiency initiatives and are actively sourcing electricity that is backed by renewable energy sources and attributes.

We pay strong attention to how we manage our waste. For our business, the biggest waste stream is e-waste given the increased use of digital devices driven by ICT, IoT solutions and the pandemic. With heightened expectations from stakeholders on resource optimisation, companies are increasingly required to ensure product stewardship from ‘cradle to cradle’, that is, upstream resource to end-of-life management and/or beginning of new life with the aim of improving circularity.

The subsequent sections describe how we intend to meet these expectations and ambitions.

# Our climate action journey during the year

Given the many interdependent yet specific dimensions of climate action, we took reference from the Corporate Climate Mitigation Blueprint published by WWF and BCG (2020) to guide us in developing our climate action plan.

# 1. Actively managing our value chain emissions towards net-zero

We have set rigorous corporate decarbonisation goals and targets. Our sustainability efforts are driven towards achieving a climate conscious future as we recognise our role and responsibility in tackling climate change. Our SBTi targets were aligned to a well below 2°C pathway when it was approved in October 2017 (see Figure 4).

In May 2022, MSCI further assessed the implied temperature rise of Singtel Group’s targets as 1.59°C.

Given that it has been five years and coupled with the updated Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report information, we are working on reviewing our SBTi targets for alignment with a 1.5°C pathway, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. In addition, we will develop a roadmap for our net-zero target by 2050 which we announced in 2019.

During the year, we completed our first full Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions assessment for FY2021 (see Figure 6 on next page) and FY2022. Our top 3 categories out of the 15 categories within Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions are purchased goods and services, capital goods and investments. Collectively they comprise 94.14% of our Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions (see Figure 5).

# Figure 5: Singtel Group Scope 3 indirect GHG emissions profile FY2021

|Category|Percentage|
|---|---|
|Purchased goods and services|60.30%|
|Capital goods|24.08%|
|Investments|9.76%|
|Use of sold products|3.42%|
|Downstream leased assets|1.43%|
|Fuel and energy-related emissions|0.76%|
|Downstream transportation and distribution|0.12%|
|Employee commute|0.06%|
|Others|0.07%|

# Reduce value chain emissions in line with our SBTi 1.5°C ambition

We have developed the Singtel Group decarbonisation hierarchy to guide us in our reduction efforts. Our options and priorities for decarbonisation in order of preference are summarised in Figure 7 on page 17.

Through the various efforts outlined below, in 2022 we reduced absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 7.2% from 2021, and by 3.3% from our SBTi baseline of 2015. The following initiatives are undertaken.

- a) Reducing Scope 1 emissions through electrification: Singtel embarked on an electrification journey during the year, as we committed to switching over 21 units of our Outside Plant Engineering fleet to electric vehicles, with the aim of converting the entire Singtel and NCS fleet of 187 vehicles progressively.
- b) Improving energy efficiency: We continuously look at improving our energy use and efficiency. Several of our programmes in Singapore and Australia target energy reduction across key energy-intensive touch points, such as network infrastructure, data centres, satellite earth stations and office buildings (see Table 1 on page 16). More details on our approach can be found at our website.

We certify our business to external environmental standards where relevant. Three of our facilities obtained the Singapore BCA-IMDA Green Mark for Data Centres Platinum Certification in 2021: Choa Chu Kang Telecommunications Exchange, Kim Chuan Telecommunications Complex 2 and DC West. In addition, Kim Chuan Telecommunications Complex 1 and 2, NCS Bedok Data Centre and DC West are also certified to SS564 Green Data Centres and ISO 50001 Energy Management System.

Moving forward, we remain committed to developing our new facilities sustainably with the lowest possible carbon impact, highest possible energy efficiency as well as superior and innovative environmentally sustainable designs.

c) Increasing deployment of onsite renewable energy

We have further enhanced our renewable energy strategy during the year to inform and guide us as we progress (see Figure 8 on page 18).

SINGAPORE TELECOMMUNICATIONS LIMITED

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022

In line with our decarbonisation strategy, Singtel Group seeks to maximise solar deployment at our premises. Since our first installation of photovoltaic panels at our Pasir Ris Telephone Exchange in 2009, we progressively increased the use of renewable energy in our network infrastructure. In the year, our renewable energy including RECs accounted for 5.8% of our energy consumption.

With the installation of a 1.65 MWp solar power system on the rooftop of our NCS Bedok Data Centre under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) arrangement, it has generated 2,249 MWh which accounted for 13% of the data centre’s consumption during the year. The solar power system, commissioned in March 2020, was one of the largest single-roof solar-powered data centres in Southeast Asia at that time.

We completed a feasibility study on all our properties during the year to assess their solar potential. We have since awarded an Engineering, Procurement and Construct (EPC) contract to deploy more renewable energy projects at up to eight Singtel sites including NCS Hub, Bukit Timah and Seletar Satellite Earth Stations, Hougang Exchange and One Serangoon North. The total capacity of these projects when completed will potentially reach 5 MWp and is expected to generate 5.4 GWh/year of renewable energy for our Singapore operations.

# 4G base station power saving features

We implemented energy saving features on our 4G mobile base stations to reduce electricity usage during low traffic hours for both outdoor and inbuilding sites.

- a) Enhanced Cell Sleep Mode: Without this feature, cells are constantly turned on at all hours. Now, these capacity cells can detect low traffic conditions and power down to save energy.
- b) AI Powered MIMO Sleep Mode: Based on machine learning, this feature can reduce power consumption in radios by automatically reconfiguring to a smaller MIMO (4x4 MIMO to 2x2 MIMO) and SIMO (Single Input Multiple Output) (2x2 MIMO to SIMO) configuration during low traffic hours. The feature is activated round the clock.

d) Sourcing of offsite renewable energy and attributes Given the land and roof constraints of our property and facilities, the onsite renewable deployment will be limited for our decarbonisation efforts. It is essential for Singtel to adopt offsite renewable energy PPAs as a means to achieve our emissions reduction targets and ambition.

However, Singapore has limited local renewable energy supply and Australia has certain risks linked to accelerated PPAs deployment. We are looking to develop a portfolio of renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset our Scope 2 emissions. In 2022, we secured 13.8 GWh of local Singapore RECs per annum from 2022 until 2025 and will start to retire these certificates from next year. We bought 2,000 I-RECs to lower our Scope 2 emissions in Singapore. We are also working to secure imported renewable energy in the coming years for our Singapore operations. In Australia, we retired 42 GWh of large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) during the year.

# Proximity to Operations

We are currently working on a national tender for renewable energy procurement to have 100% of our electricity requirements backed by renewable energy sources by end-2025 for our Australia operations. We will proactively seek renewable energy potential in the markets where we operate to secure renewables PPAs for our operations and buy RECs as near to our operations as possible where local RECs are limited.

e) Investing in high-quality carbon offsets

After exhausting our first four options to decarbonise our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we will look to carbon offsets as a last resort to manage our emissions that are hard to abate. While we have not acquired any carbon credits to date, we are preparing ourselves by monitoring the standards, accounting treatment, government recognition and other developments closely.

# Our Sustainability Approach

2. Linking emissions to financing to quantify carbon and drive changes

We recognise the importance of linking sustainability and finance to include carbon considerations in business decision making processes to drive change. This includes making low-emission choices for the business and making investments in climate-related projects.

a) Sustainable finance

We are committed to linking our financing approach to our progress in achieving mid to long-term sustainability goals that will enable us to reach net-zero by 2050.

# b) Internal carbon pricing

We conducted an internal carbon pricing (ICP) pilot for our Singapore operations where we used a shadow price of S$50 per tonne of CO2e for energy-intensive business cases. We applied this hypothetical price for GHG emissions as a guide for business and investment decisions. With this approach, we took the first step of incorporating ICP for large capital expenditure projects that are energy intensive as a pilot, as energy consumption is a material topic for the Singtel Group. Next year, we plan to incorporate ICP into our business processes, allowing Singtel Group to incorporate climate considerations in our decisions to incentivise investments in energy efficiency and low-carbon innovation. This will be a major step towards achieving our sustainability goal to become more resilient to regulatory climate policies and our commitment to emission reductions.

# 3. Address physical risks through network adaptation and advocate for climate action

Since our physical risk climate scenario analysis in 2015, we have been undertaking numerous adaptations across our Singapore and Australia operations to build resilience to natural disasters and long-term climate scenarios. We have progressively adapted our infrastructure design and

# Full TCFD climate scenario assessment highlights

In 2021, we conducted a TCFD pilot in the Northern Rivers Region of New South Wales, Australia. This exercise was to assist us with identifying and narrowing down the most material physical and transition risk drivers. Drawing on the initial assessment, we performed further analysis on transition risks for insights and material financial drivers. This year, we conducted a full TCFD climate scenario analysis using three material transition levers and physical risks for both Singtel and Optus nationwide.

# Physical Risk Assessment:

- >1,900 mobile sites assessed for Australia
- 82 key Singapore assets assessed, further narrowed to ten high-risk locations for financial impact analysis
- Our conclusion was that the financial impact from climate physical risks was deemed less material as the business continued to undertake proactive planning and adaptation of the infrastructure to mitigate the long-term physical effects of climate change under the different scenarios

# Transition Risks:

- Key risks for Singtel are limited availability and cost of local/imported renewable energy, and market competition for low-emission ICT services like data centre
- Key risks for Optus are activism, introduction/increase of carbon taxes and volatile energy prices

Please refer to our inaugural standalone TCFD Report 2022 for a fuller discussion and disclosure on our climate scenario analysis of physical and transition risks and opportunities.

# Case study: Our ICP pilot in Singapore

During the year, we completed a pilot launch of our ICP framework on energy-intensive projects to assess its administrative feasibility and effectiveness.

One of the projects that has undergone this pilot analysis is the building of a new data centre. The proposed internal shadow carbon price was applied to the business case, using different energy consumption levels in the design for comparison. The less energy-efficient design appeared to be more economical in the original analysis. However, the inclusion of internal carbon price steered the conclusion towards the design with better power usage effectiveness (PUE) and consequently reduced the overall power consumption of the project by 7.5% over its useful life. PUE is a ratio that describes how efficiently the data centre equipment uses energy.

It was also proven that this framework has considerable potential to increase understanding, motivation and actions for reducing energy use, costs and GHG emissions at Singtel. We retrospectively applied our ICP framework on the selection of 5G network equipment. The inclusion of ICP further enhanced the decision to pursue more energy efficient equipment, which reduces overall power consumption of the equipment over its useful life by 20% while improving the total cost of ownership by 1%.

We actively monitor and engage in regulatory developments relating to reporting and carbon emission taxes, as well as provide annual comprehensive energy reporting to the National Green Energy Regulator (NGER). In 2020, we set up the Australian National University-Optus Bushfire Research Centre to develop a national system to detect bushfires early using an autonomous ground-based and aerial fire detection system. A constellation of satellites complements the fire detection system to spot and track fires and deploy extinguishing technologies. The programme will run until 2024.

We play a leading role on the GSMA Board and Climate Action Committee, helping to chart the strategic direction in tackling climate change for the ICT and mobile industry. GSMA is an industry organisation that represents the interests of over 750 mobile network operators. During the year, we participated in the development of GSMA strategy paper on a circular.

economy for network equipment and shared our climate journey with fellow members at GSMA events. At the country level, we actively partner governments and national agencies to understand emerging risks, policies and regulations. In Singapore, we engage the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), National Environment Agency (NEA), IMDA and Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC). We are represented in the Pro-Tem Committee for E-waste Management Standard under the Environment and Resources Standards Committee of the Singapore Standardisation Programme. We also actively participate in business roundtables to share and discuss climate risks, TCFD and SBTi.

# a) Demonstrating thought leadership

We actively share our experience to support and motivate others to start their own climate journey. Some of the notable events that Singtel was represented during the year include UNFCC Climate Neutral Now Initiative - Panel on net-zero and carbon neutral roadmap, challenges and opportunities; GSMA Asia Conference; 2021 Shared Value Summit Asia Pacific - Disasters Resilience Track Voices from COP26: Why it matters to businesses in Singapore by WWF Singapore; and Sustainability Reporting for the Future Seminar by PwC Singapore and Centre for Governance and Sustainability of National University of Singapore. Our TCFD effort was also featured as a case study for the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants Climate Disclosure Guide - Taking First Steps Towards Climate-related Disclosures.

# b) Engaging with our employees

Earth Hour is not about reducing energy or carbon, but a powerful symbol of unity and hope in collective action. We continue to collaborate with WWF Singapore and fulfilled our commitment to Earth Hour 2022. On 26 March this year, we turned off and dimmed non-essential lighting at our properties and retail stores for an hour from 8.30pm to 9.30pm. We also encouraged our employees to pledge their support by turning off their lights at home, as well as adopt environmentally conscious habits to ‘Go Beyond The Hour’.

# c) Enabling customers to contribute to climate action

With a customer base of more than 15 million in Singapore and Australia, there exists huge opportunities for us to engage them to join us and play our part for the planet (see boxed-up story above).

# Green ICT

We are constantly exploring smart mobile technologies to reduce energy consumption and emissions beyond our industry to benefit other sectors of the economy. Technology innovation in the areas of connectivity, low PUE data centres, cloud solutions, big data and IoT enable the development of energy efficient solutions that can be applied across industries and help advance decarbonisation efforts in other sectors. During the year, we focused on our 5G network rollout in Singapore and Australia to empower our customers by delivering greater speed, higher device capacity and ultra-low latency. During network planning and implementation, we used network analytic tools to analyse traffic trending and roll out 5G with precision to meet performance demands at lower costs and greater energy efficiency. We implemented dynamic spectrum sharing to run 4G and 5G services simultaneously on the same frequencies to avoid the need of adding new energy-consuming hardware. We also built a dual-mode core network to support both 4G and 5G services instead of operating two separate core networks.

# PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP

Our approach to product stewardship considers the impact of our products and services before they reach our stores, during our operations and after their useful life. We manage our waste resulting from Singtel and Optus branded products, and also review waste data to glean insights that help to improve the recyclability, reusability and reduction of our waste.

# Effective waste management

Electronic, packaging and corporate wastes such as paper are key sources of wastes generated across our operations and value chain. We are committed to reducing, reusing and recycling wherever possible and support national waste management targets under Singapore Green Plan 2030 and Australia’s Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 2020. There are global concerns around e-waste being a fast-growing category of waste, given the increasingly digital lifestyle which has been further accelerated by the pandemic. Within our operations, we have put in place an e-waste recycling process to ensure proper management of our used equipment and track the recycling rate.

# Benefits of 5G in the corporate world

Leveraging our new 5G networks, companies can increase the energy efficiency of delivering data to their customers. They can also develop innovative green technologies and help reduce the carbon footprint of their operations and customers globally.

- Our reliable network and ICT services and solutions allow corporate customers to maintain productivity while lowering emissions from reduced transportation.
- Our 5G Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) platform enables low latency monitoring of campuses, environments and facilities through IoT applications that are connected to autonomous systems like robots and drones, leading to a reduction of emissions from reduced number of field trips taken by the operational teams while improving productivity.
- Video analytics enabled by our MEC platform can identify faulty products at the assembly line for Industry 4.0 scenarios and take them out before hitting the supply chain, thereby saving emissions from customers returning faulty products to the manufacturer who will need to ship replacement products.
- IoT applications for smart buildings can optimise space utilisation, energy and cooling efficiency based on real-time occupancy. Such IoT sensors can leverage our MEC through inbuilding 5G coverage or WiFi which can be reached from any fixed or cellular network. This multi-network capability allows existing brown field IoT deployments to optimise energy consumption of devices by shifting all data processing to the edge, therefore increasing battery life of devices and also lowering emissions from reduced field trips to replace batteries.

# Community Impact

Under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme introduced by NEA in July 2021, Singtel Group bears the responsibility for collecting and treating our products when they reach the end of life, based on our market share. In Singapore, we contribute to this new regulated e-waste management system and retired ReCYCLE, our e-waste recycling programme in partnership with SingPost launched in 2017. From January to December 2021, we put 181.6 tonnes of products to market for both our consumer and enterprise segments. From July 2021 to March 2022, we collected 2.7 tonnes of consumer e-waste and were responsible for 2.3 tonnes of all the consumer e-waste collected island-wide under the scheme.

In Australia, we have been partnering Mobile Muster since 1998 to facilitate the recycling of mobile devices and accessories via our Optus stores. During the year, we diverted 5.61 tonnes of e-waste from landfills, saving 12.45 tonnes of emissions while conserving 63.55 tonnes of mineral resources through the programme. We also have a modem recycling programme to supplement Mobile Muster for customers to recycle their old modems at any of our retail stores in Australia.

# Reducing plastic waste with GOMO’s half-sized SIM card

Our all-digital mobile brand GOMO launched its half-sized SIM card in December 2021, which reduced plastic waste, and introduced environmentally friendly materials to the packaging:

- Packaging Envelope (holds the backing card) – 140gsm Enviro wove, 100% recyclable and FSC certified
- Backing Card (SIM card is pasted on this) – 300gsm Woodfree card, 100% recyclable and FSC certified

Comparing the dimensions between the old and new packaging, we reduced the total area of the main envelope and additional manual by approximately 30%, from 182,810 mm2 to 126,800 mm2.

By 31 March 2022, we saved 42.95 kg of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic (ABS plastic) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a 7% reduction in materials for all GOMO SIM cards, full and half. Through these initiatives, we hope to nudge consumers and our retailers to be conscious of their packaging waste. We will continue to collaborate with suppliers to explore alternative materials such as recycled materials to be used in our packaging.

Under the Resource Sustainability Act, Singtel is required to report our packaging waste as part of the Mandatory Packaging Reporting. The list of regulated products and our reporting obligations are categorised into three packaging categories: primary packaging for Singtel branded products, service packaging used by all Singtel retail channels, and all packaging used for products exclusively imported for our business.

We report our packaging data and 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) plans to NEA annually, starting from this year. We submitted our first report and 3R plans in March 2022 for calendar year 2021. During that year, the total amount of packaging used by Singtel and NCS was 147.14 tonnes, with paper being our top material (see Figure 9).

We will focus on packaging reduction and increasing the use of recycled content in our packaging materials. We will also take a targeted approach to tackle each type of unique waste that we are responsible for, such as bags and SIM cards.

In Australia, we have been committed to the principles of the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) since 2007 to drive systemic change in the way we create, collect and recover our product packaging. For the fifth consecutive year, Optus was awarded the APCO Award.

for our sustainable packaging achievements and efforts in the telecommunications sector. We are also committed to continuous improvement and are working hard to remove single-use plastics from packaging design and enhance the uptake of Australasian Recycling Label (ARL) to reduce recycling confusion. We have introduced a new sustainable packaging checklist for all new Optus-branded devices.

# Environmental performance

During the year, there was no environmental legislation related fine or non-monetary sanction, as well as legal action against Singtel or Optus. We publicly disclose our environmental targets and metrics aligned with the latest GRI standards and our performance data is externally assured. Our stakeholders can therefore better understand our efforts and progress in this area. We will also communicate any material driver and impact on the company’s income statement, cashflows or balance sheet using the TCFD framework.

1. GHG emissions are derived in accordance with the requirements of the “GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard” and “Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard” by World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The equivalent CO2 emissions for electricity used are calculated based on the updated simple operating margin grid emission factors from the National Environment Agency, Energy Market Authority and electricity supplier emission factor in Singapore for the relevant time period and from Australian National Greenhouse Gas Account factors for grid emissions relating to the corresponding states in Australia. Scope 1 direct emissions and Scope 3 indirect emissions are calculated using: Supplier specific emissions factors, updated BEIS (Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy) Greenhouse Gas reporting: conversion factors, National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme (NGERS), USEPA GHG Emission Factors (April 2022) and Singapore’s Fourth Biennial Update Report. Relevant emission factors were sourced from: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) report on Singapore NEWater, various Australian and international Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) databases (Aus LCI Version 1.31 and Australasian LCI Version 2014.09 databases), and Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA)’s End-of-Life Management Options for Mobile Telephones in Australia were applied to consumption category of primary data to calculate Scope 3 indirect emissions. For spend based category data, emissions factors from the LCI database Exiobase (v3.3) implemented in SimaPro 9.1.1.1 were applied by economic sectors and geographic regions to calculate the Scope 3 indirect emissions.

2. Optus uses a combination of air, water and refrigerant cooling systems.

3. Restated and reclassified to Scope 3 Category 13 for Singtel Scope 2 numbers for FY2021. Market-based emissions are reported based on emission factor of electricity suppliers, onsite renewable energy and retired RECs.

4. New reporting of full 15 categories from FY2021.

5. Reported in Scope 3 Category 1 and 2 emissions.

6. The reduction in business air travel is due to travel restriction arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Figure 1: Singtel Group People Framework

The Singtel Group wants to create a highly engaged and dedicated workforce as our people are key to the Group’s long-term growth and success. Our efforts are guided by our People Framework (see Figure 1) which focuses on Safety and Well-being as well as Talent and Future of Work.

We empower our people by investing in their professional and personal development, and equipping them with future skills. We also ensure inclusive employment and work environment, as well as meaningful work that allow them to grow and have a rewarding career with us.

As the world recovers from the pandemic, we will continue to focus on our employees’ safety and well-being. During the year, we announced our Group purpose, Empower Every Generation, and refreshed our core values which we will integrate into every aspect of our business. It reflects our intention to bring everyone along into a more sustainable digital future, while advancing the world for our future generations through stewardship and innovation.

We drive and reinforce positive employee behaviours at work through our six refreshed core values: Cultivate a growth mindset; Operate with integrity; Make customers first; Maximise teamwork; Innovate with a challenger spirit; and Take ownership. They form the mnemonic COMMIT, demonstrating our commitment to excellence, innovation and sustainability.

They are the foundation of how we operate our business as we harness the power of technology to enrich the lives of our customers and the broader community, help our people develop and grow with the company in the new economy, and live up to all our stakeholders’ expectations as a responsible corporate citizen and sustainability steward. We also mapped these behaviours against our sustainability framework.

In three months, about 4,500 employees attended weekly iCare mental, physical and financial well-being webinars that we conducted. They learnt tips from experts and heard experiences of fellow colleagues, who shared how they coped with situations, such as the loss of a loved one overseas while borders were closed.

# WORKFORCE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING

# Promoting employee health and well-being

The pandemic has accentuated the importance of employee well-being and staying resilient. At Singtel Group, our priority is for our employees to remain healthy, both physically and mentally, at work and home. During the year, we also officially introduced blended ways of working (B-WoW) to allow more flexibility in work arrangements to cater to the work-life integration needs of our people, even in a post-pandemic world.

Throughout the year, we conducted regular employee pulse surveys and polls to explore areas of well-being that mattered most to our people. Based on their responses, we launched the iCare programme to our Singapore employees in October 2021 to raise greater awareness of the importance of mental well-being. A series of initiatives and programmes was organised to encourage and empower our people to look after their own mental health and take care of one another as we continue with a hybrid work arrangement.

We introduced a monthly iCare newsletter with various themes addressing concerns close to the hearts of our people, such as tackling burnout and easing them back into work at the office. We also sent fortnightly staff emails on a variety of wellness topics and featured Singtel and NCS role models who shared their personal well-being journey.

We partnered a mental healthcare company to offer a digital mental well-being app as a virtual buddy for all employees across the Singtel Group. The self-care mobile app includes a range of programmes to support employees’ emotional well-being, resilience and personal development proactively. Employees can access personalised support from a behavioural health coach to build self-awareness, learn how to manage daily stress and work on personal goals.

# A family-friendly work culture

Koh Wee Liang is a project manager with Group Enterprise and is happily married with three children. Before 2020 prior to COVID-19, he weighed close to 100kg, suffered from hypertension for 18 years and had pre-diabetic symptoms. Two years later, flexible work arrangements have given Wee Liang the time to kickstart his fitness journey while he collaborated with our onsite clinic doctor who created a personalised health plan targeting his chronic illnesses. This helped Wee Liang lose 30kg and stop the need for hypertension medication.

With hybrid work arrangements and Singtel’s family-friendly policies, Wee Liang has been able to work from home more often and grow closer to his children. Time saved from not commuting means more quality time spent with family. He can also bring his wife, children and elderly parents for their medical appointments, tapping on the company’s flexible family leave scheme. Wee Liang said that our family-friendly work culture is one of the key factors that motivates him to stay on as an employee.

In line with building more inclusion and awareness around chronic illnesses, our annual health screening package for Operations and Support employees was enhanced to include additional tests to better detect significant conditions. iConnect, our all-in-one employee services app, was further upgraded to include clinic appointment bookings for improved experience at our onsite clinic.

We will continue to support employee resilience with a holistic well-being strategy based on five pillars: mental, physical, financial, social well-being and professional development. We will address the concerns raised by our people, such as chronic illness disease management and looking after young children or elderly parents while carving out time for self-care (see Figure 2).

In Australia, employees take part in monthly webinars on topics across six pillars of health: emotional, physical, social, vocational, financial and environmental. They also have access to Health Risk Assessments which help our people learn more about their health and lifestyle factors which can improve their well-being. The health and well-being of our people is paramount, as we continue to create a work environment that promotes employee wellness and mindfulness, both physical and mental, so that our people can be the ‘Best of Me’ individually and the ‘Best of We’ together.

Wee Liang (second from right) with his family

iCare has garnered strong support within months of its launch. Our people also expressed interest in other topics such as creating a culture of openness and learning how to deal with stress more effectively.

In our latest annual Your Voice Survey, 82% of our people felt strongly supported by the organisation and their managers in their overall well-being. Given the importance of this topic, we have introduced an additional 2025 well-being target of 84% as measured in our annual Your Voice Survey, under the material topic of employee safety and well-being (see page 9).

At the same time, we strongly encourage our people to speak to their leaders and colleagues, and use our Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) should they feel stressed especially in these challenging times. Our EAP offers services such as clinical counselling, support for financial and legal matters, and trauma management. The programme also provides medical insurance to immediate family members.

# Building a workforce committed to WSH

Workplace safety and health (WSH) is our top priority. We strive to inculcate good safety and security habits and practices among our people, encouraging them to take ownership of the risks and hazards associated with their work activities and appropriate measures to prevent accidents.

We launched the WSH tool in iConnect to empower our people to report any safety hazards or concerns at the workplace by snapping a picture and providing details of what they observe. The report is routed to our WSH team for investigation and rectification before any accident occurs. Read more about our Health, Safety and Security Policy here.

To generate greater WSH awareness and educate employees, we publish quarterly bulletins on our staff portal Espresso on topics like slip, trip and fall prevention as well as fire prevention. See Table 1 for staff injury cases during the year.

We also adopted the concept of Gemba Walk, a WSH practice mainly used in the manufacturing industry. We conducted the walk for nine work sites during the year, which involved our employees, relevant third-party like

facilities management personnel, and WSH team. The intent is to make observations on processes and identify safety lapses in work areas or activities, thus allowing all parties to address safety-related issues proactively and collaboratively. In partnership with UTES, the remuneration and benefits packages were enhanced to be more competitive with the market, including a new service recognition award category for employees who have completed 50 years of service, up to three days of non-consecutive sick leave during each calendar year without a medical certificate, and up to two days of skills advancement leave for any SkillsFuture course.

# People & Future of Work

The Singtel Group employed 22,105 people, comprising 12,196 in Singapore, 7,268 in Australia and the rest based around the world as at 31 March 2022. In Singapore, we abide by the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) Employment Act and ensure that employment practices are aligned with the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices set out by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP). Singtel is also a signatory of the Singapore Employers’ Pledge of Fair Employment Practices.

We have fostered a very strong and collaborative partnership with the Union of Telecom Employees (UTES) in Singapore since its inception in 1982. In July 2021, Singtel renewed the Collective Agreement for Singapore-based Operations and Support employees, certified by the Industrial Arbitration Court for the next three years.

We also support the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) U Care Fund with an annual donation of S$100,000. During the year, we disbursed S$21,296 to 36 schooling children of our staff under the joint Singtel-UTES Bursary Awards scheme.

In addition, we contributed S$1 million to the NTUC Education and Training Fund over a five-year period from 2017 to 2021 to support NTUC’s efforts to advance the professional development of the workforce.

In Australia, our industrial relations frameworks comply with the requirements of the Fair Work Act. In March 2022, we successfully renegotiated the Optus Employment Partnership Agreement (EPA), with 93% of employees voting in agreement with the EPA. Enhancements to the EPA focus on supporting the diverse lives of employees and account for market practices, such as recognition of kinship for our Indigenous employees for compassionate leave, and an annual Connected Day for our people to take one paid day off to connect with what matters most to them.

We treat our employees fairly and with respect and provide them with equal opportunities based on meritocracy. The Singtel Group is committed to providing employees with a work environment that is conducive, physically and psychologically safe and free from discrimination, harassment and retaliation. We take workplace grievances seriously and our Grievance Reporting Policy applies to the entire Group of companies. Every employee is expected to comply with our grievance procedures, which also apply to business relationships and activities where our people are involved.

This is communicated to all our employees, who can raise concerns and report any bias or discrimination that happens at the workplace without fear of reprisal. They can do so through our independent grievance reporting tool that is readily available on Espresso, our employee portal. We have established clear guidelines for managing grievance cases. Reported cases are handled with urgency and in confidence, thoroughly investigated and tracked through to closure. We engage all affected stakeholders in two-way dialogues and ensure proper follow-up on resolution and satisfactory closure. During the year, we logged 12 grievance cases in Singapore and 27 in Australia (see Table 2 and 3).

We offer various benefits to our employees to help them stay healthy and manage professional and personal demands. These include insurance and medical coverage, free annual health screenings, disease management programmes and flexible benefit dollars which is an annual cash payment catered to meet lifestyle needs. We also accord our eligible employees with paid parental leave: 16 weeks maternity and two weeks paternity leave. In Australia, we have paid parental leave and support for stillbirth and pregnancy loss as well as family and domestic violence entitlements.

Our friendly family policies include flexible work schedules, telecommuting and various forms of family leave arrangements, such as childcare and family care leave. We also provide employees the opportunity to continue working at the company beyond their retirement age.

# Driving a purpose-led culture

The Singtel Group is committed to organisational growth and developing our people. Our Group purpose and values underpin this and are embedded into our business strategy and work culture. We constantly reinforce the purpose and values through regular staff communication and messaging by leaders.

To drive a purpose-led culture, we ran an eight-week long Purpose campaign and held webinars for our employees in Singapore to deepen their understanding of their job roles and behaviours that support Singtel’s purpose which is to Empower Every Generation.

# About this Report

We also designed a programme to deepen employees’ understanding of the Group purpose and core values, and equip them with practical frameworks to apply and exhibit the expected COMMIT behaviours in their work. We target to train up to 4,000 employees in the new year. So far, over 1,000 employees have completed training. We endeavour to place purpose and our values at the core of our people practices by integrating it into our business and people processes, such as recruitment, leadership assessment and performance management.

Other than equipping our employees with skills, we introduced the Group CEO Empower Awards, which recognises employees who embody the purpose and are exemplary in demonstrating COMMIT core values.

# DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION (DEI)

DEI is core to our purpose at Singtel as we commit to Empower Every Generation through the collective experiences and collaborative capabilities of our diverse workforce. We have a diverse workforce with close to 100 nationalities over four generations: Baby Boomer (1946-1964), Gen X (1965-1980), Millennials (1981-1996) and Gen Z (1997-2012). Millenials, or Gen Y, make up about half of our workforce. Comprising a wide range of experiences and voices, our people represent the markets and communities in which we operate.

We achieve equity by providing access to opportunities for everyone through fair and respectful policies and actions. We also aspire to build an inclusive culture that inspires innovation and progress where everyone belongs, and our people share a common purpose and can succeed as their best, authentic selves.

We respect the rights of individuals and do not discriminate based on their backgrounds, beliefs and abilities. During the year, we formalised and published the Singtel Group Human Rights Statement, covering critical human rights topics including child rights. We are committed to providing employees with a work environment that is conducive, safe and free from discrimination and harassment. We also prohibit any form of retaliation against any person for making reports in good faith concerning allegations of discrimination, harassment, violation of our Code of Conduct or any other allegation of improper behaviour.

As a strong advocate of fair and merit-based employment practices, we regularly review our practices to ensure no discrimination such as in our hiring process.

# Climate Change & Environment

Across the Group, female employees account for a third of our total workforce, comprising 35% in Singapore and 32% in Australia. They represented 32% of top executives and 28% executives (previously known as middle management) in the Group. Together, we had 28% of female executives across the Group as at 31 March 2022, against our target of reaching 32% of female employees in management by FY2025. We also have 31% and 40% of female Board members and Management Committee members, with two female CEOs, who head Consumer Singapore and Optus.

# People & Future of Work

Through inclusive hiring practices and investments in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) ecosystem with the creation of the Singtel-Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Women in Tech Scholarship, we are making progress in increasing our female representation in technology roles. As at 31 March 2022, women represented 29% in technological roles at various functions like IT and Networks across the Singtel Group.

By embracing diversity, we gain a better understanding of the various needs of our customers and communities, thus forging stronger connections and delivering greater impact for them. Our efforts on DEI were recognised for the fourth consecutive year by 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for our commitment to gender equality.

We ensure our processes for employee performance evaluation, promotion and talent identification have no inherent gender bias. Our employees also perceive DEI in the organisation very positively, with a high 81% Your Voice score in our recent employee engagement survey.

We commemorated International Women’s Day 2022 with a month-long of activities. We organised panel discussions featuring female leaders, employees and women making ripples in the community. We also curated two courses on #CURIOUS, our mobile digital learning platform, on what unconscious bias means and developing an inclusion mindset.

In Australia, we launched Employee Networks, which aim to create an inclusive culture for women, persons with various abilities and disabilities, people with different culture and heritage, LGBTQ+ individuals and veterans.

All managers are constantly reminded of the following key principles, which cover shortlisting and interviewing candidates and how they manage their team members after hire:

1. Recruit and select candidates on the basis of merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), regardless of age, race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, religion, family status or disability.
2. Treat employees fairly and respectfully, and implement progressive human resource management systems.
3. Provide employees with equal opportunity to be considered for training and development based on their strengths and needs, to help them achieve their full potential.
4. Reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience.
5. Abide by local labour laws.

In the current economy living with COVID-19 and the associated Great Resignation wave faced by companies globally, it has become even more challenging to attract and retain, especially tech talent. Due to the rapid digitisation and e-commerce adoption across all sectors worldwide, companies demand technical specialists and customer service professionals to address their escalating needs for maintaining online platforms and managing customer experience.

Companies therefore need to differentiate themselves to attract the right talents. We do so by building a purpose-led organisation, creating an inclusive culture, and developing meaningful and impactful careers for our employees.

The Singtel Group focuses on building our talent pipeline and employees’ career progression, while investing in their long-term development. This will bolster both retention and overall development of the organisation, and help to entrench our position as employer of choice. Our young talents are nurtured under various programmes, such as internships and the Management Associate Programme (MAP). During the year, 143 students from polytechnics and universities in Singapore joined our SHINE internship programme across various business functions. We also onboarded 52 MAs who will each have at least two job rotations during their first two years, with high performers put on an accelerated career path.

We launched a people transformation programme at NCS focused on culture, skill specialisation and becoming an organisation built on learning. Based on individual preferences, performance and aptitude, our tech professionals have opportunities to move across specialisations, work in different regions and industries, and with different clients and partners to gain a wider range of experience.

Fresh graduates who join NCS can participate in our Nucleus programme, where we provide a holistic and structured foundation to kickstart their career in technology. The programme encompasses structured training, a progressive career roadmap, job rotations, reward and benefits, career coaching and industry recognised certifications. During the year, 219 graduates joined our programme. In September 2021, we held a virtual celebration for those who completed their first Graduate Certificate as part of the National University of Singapore’s Institute of Systems Science’s (NUS-ISS) Master of Technology.

# Talent development and future skills

The shift to a digital economy means that building a vibrant and agile workforce is more important than ever. Singtel Group will continue to invest in our people – skilled employees, subject matter experts and exceptional leaders (see Figure 7 and 8). Our people development philosophy comprises four essential components: expertise, exposure, experience and engagement.

The Singtel Group’s people development ecosystem is made up of three corporate academies in Singtel, NCS and Optus and we have formed partnerships with a wide range of institutes of higher learning, consulting firms, think tanks, knowledge platforms and leadership institutes. It is critical to continuously develop and nurture our employees with skills and competencies to stay relevant. We invest heavily in our people and provide ample opportunities for their professional and personal development. We believe in cultivating a growth mindset across the Group and are committed to harnessing the power of technology to create a sustainable and inclusive future for everyone.

This also supported the goal of training 2,500 employees in 5G-related skills over two years, set by our 5G Workforce Transformation Committee (WTC) last year. Since then, more than 700 employees have undergone 5G training and another 1,020 employees have benefited from our curated 5G curriculum.

# Company Training Committee

In 2019, Singtel signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the formation of a Company Training Committee (CTC) with UTES. We committed a S$45 million training investment over three years from 12 September 2019 to 11 September 2022 to boost the digital skills of our people.

We also enhanced the way we discuss talent mobility and development. To support our talents in their day-to-day growth, we launched an improved playbook for managers describing a framework and process on how to equip talents with the right knowledge and skills to progress. We also introduced virtual coaching to pair talents with certified coaches to bridge any development gaps and unlock potential. We encourage everyone to take charge of their own learning and career development and challenge their capabilities.

# Our Sustainability Approach

During the year, we set up NCS Dojo, an immersive learning academy and platform that is anchored on business and people transformation priorities. NCS Dojo focuses on providing leadership programmes and building the company into a learning organisation where we bring people together to learn.

In Australia, we have Optus U, our micro-credential programme, where we partner leading universities to provide employees with relevant and future skills such as data analytics. Our people participate in lectures and talks by guest speakers, as well as workshops and projects delivered by our education partners La Trobe University, Macquarie University and Curtin University. During the year, 300 Optus employees graduated from the programme.

We continue to reinforce and promote a vibrant learning and innovative culture geared towards empowered and continuous learning. This will allow our employees to be deployed in a manner that meets evolving business priorities, as well as remain relevant with the right skills and knowledge in this ever-changing operating environment.

# People & Future of Work

Upskilling and reskilling for a future-ready workforce. We continue to build collective capacity to lead the change for a digital future. We support the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA), a SkillsFuture initiative by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in partnership with agencies like Workforce Singapore (WSG) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), as well as collaborate with industry partners and hiring employers.

TeSA offers various programmes to support current infocomm technology (ICT) professionals and non-ICT professionals to upgrade and acquire new skills and domain knowledge that are in demand, and to stay competitive and meet the challenges of a fast-moving digital landscape. During the year, we onboarded 225 trainees from the TeSa Mid-Career Advance programme, which provides reskilling opportunities for Singapore citizens above 40.

In addition, we actively engage our people in professional conversion. Through the Professional Conversion Accelerator programme, we successfully converted 1,201 employees into new positions for various roles, including 5G-related ones.

Figure 1: Singtel Group Community Impact Framework

Aligned with our purpose, Empower Every Generation, the Singtel Group is committed to driving sustainable change by empowering communities through equity and inclusion as well as digital enablement to provide equal opportunities and access for all. So that no one is left behind.

Digital enablement is at the core of our community impact strategy (see Figure 1). We recognise that our ICT capability and competence, product technology, expertise and innovation have created positive and lasting impact on generations of people through the years. And we aim to continue to advance the world for future generations to come.

We believe that digital enablement addresses several community material topics – including online safety, digital access and inclusion, as well as fostering education and employability – identified in our materiality review and stakeholder engagement exercise.

Our focus on equity and inclusion demonstrates the company’s commitment to support the vulnerable – children, youth and seniors, disadvantaged families and communities, and persons with disabilities. Our initiatives aim to uplift them with resources to thrive and build community resilience including exposure to natural disaster risks and impacts.

We are represented in global, national and industry committees such as GSMA working groups, National Council of Social Service (NCSS).

# BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

Digital access is critical for people to participate meaningfully within society today, such as fixed and mobile data and voice communication, and online commerce and banking. However, segments of the population such as seniors, low-income families and migrant workers risk getting left behind due to lack of resource, knowledge or skill.

The Singtel Group works closely with national agencies and charity partners to narrow the digital divide. We tap on our ICT strengths to support the underserved population, providing them with digital access and skills to improve their lives and livelihood. In Singapore, our programmes are aligned with IMDA’s Digital for Life movement which affirms our commitment to build a digitally inclusive society where all Singaporeans are empowered to realise their fullest potential. In Australia, our programmes Donate Your Data and Donate Your Device address the digital divide by supporting disadvantaged students, families as well as individuals in crisis with data access and connectivity.

# Digital Inclusion Benchmark 2021

Singtel Group’s commitment to advancing digital inclusion has been recognised by the World Benchmarking Alliance’s Digital Inclusion Benchmark (DIB) 2021. DIB ranks the world’s most influential 150 technology companies on their responsibility to advance a more inclusive digital society and enable the achievement of the UN SDGs. Singtel Group ranked 20th out of the 150 tech companies and the second best performing company headquartered in Southeast Asia, demonstrating strong performance in digital inclusion.

We also ranked third among all benchmarked companies in the ‘Access’ category, in recognition of our programmes like Donate Your Data and Singtel Digital Silvers that make digital technologies more widely available, affordable and accessible. This affirms our commitment to cultivating a more inclusive digital society through our core business and competence.

# Enabling customers and employees to build an inclusive digital future

# Optus Donate Your Data

Since 2018, we have been bridging the digital divide for disadvantaged and vulnerable young Australians through Optus’ Donate Your Data programme. We empower our customers to donate their mobile data to those who need it most. The connectivity provided enables disadvantaged students to continue to learn and have access to online lessons and resources especially when more learning moved online during the pandemic. Amid the pressure and isolation brought about by the pandemic, we expanded our programme to cover families and people experiencing crisis. We provide SIM plans to the homeless and those experiencing domestic violence and affected by natural disasters.

Donated data is pooled and shared with young people, their families and other Australians supported by our charity partners such as Australian Business and Community Network (ABCN), KARI Foundation and The Smith Family. During the year, we onboarded more than 10,000 participants, bringing the total number of beneficiaries to over 27,000. Since December 2019, our customers have donated over 40 million GB of data through this programme. In recognition of our programme and its meaningful impact, we received the 2021 Australian Communications Industry Awards for Innovation by a large company.

# Taking collective action on domestic and family violence

We are expanding our digital inclusion efforts to help seniors reap the benefits of the digital world, ensuring they are not only equipped with essential digital literacy skills but also have access to reliable connectivity.

As part of the Telco Together Foundation, Optus is proud to contribute to the Domestic and Family Violence Action Plan Framework, an industry-first framework that will improve how we support Australians experiencing domestic and family violence. Communication devices and services can be a lifeline in these situations but can also be tools for control and abuse. The framework includes a comprehensive and standardised set of guidelines to train employees of participating telcos on how to best support victims and ultimately reduce instances of domestic and family violence.

# Optus Donate Your Device

Through the digital inclusion roundtables that we organised, we garnered further insights from our Australian community partners. While our Donate Your Data programme was highly successful, many vulnerable people lacked devices to take advantage of the availability of free mobile data. Hence, we launched Donate Your Device during the year to encourage customers to help bridge the digital divide by donating preloved or brand new devices to people who cannot afford a device or mobile data access.

Working with our charity partner Good360 Australia, customers can drop their phones at our stores, which will then be checked, cleaned, data wiped and repackaged with a new charger, ready for donation to someone in need. In addition to a donated handset, beneficiaries receive an Optus prepaid SIM loaded with data donated by our customers. Our programme also has a positive environmental impact as we keep unused devices out of the Australia landfill by giving them a new lease of life. Mobile phones deemed unsuitable for donation are recycled through our Optus’ in-store Mobile Muster programme.

# Empowering seniors to go digital

In Singapore, we introduced the Singtel Digital Silvers programme in September 2020, under our digital enablement strategy and efforts, to address the challenges posed by the pandemic as many live-alone seniors in Singapore were isolated from community and social support. We sponsor WiFi broadband connection and Singtel TV ethnic content channels (Chinese, Malay, and Indian) at the Senior Activity Centres (SACs) run by NTUC Health, Thye Hua Kwan and Fei Yue, transforming them into digital hubs.

Our staff volunteers conduct weekly one-on-one sessions with seniors at SACs to help them pick up basic digital skills, such as smartphone functions like camera and voice messaging, useful apps like YouTube, surfing the internet, using digital payment and protecting themselves from online dangers. These Wednesday sessions are currently conducted at all our Singtel Shops before opening hours, as well as SACs in the afternoon.

During the year, we empowered more than 7,000 seniors with such digital knowledge under the guidance of more than 250 dedicated Singtel staff volunteers. Our survey found that more than 65% of the seniors now have more confidence using mobile phones and apps to navigate in the digital world.

In August 2021, we launched Singtel Digital Silvers’ Journey, a series of instructional videos on digital skills produced in-house. They are made simple for seniors to follow, learn and revise independently. Each video focuses on different digital skills that are vital for everyday use in an increasingly tech-savvy world. We also collaborated with popular media personalities like Jin Jie to launch ‘Jin Jie Goes Digital’. This social media campaign aimed to raise seniors’ awareness on how they could upgrade their digital skills to enhance their lives and stay connected. The campaign attracted over 200,000 views in two months and further bridged the digital divide for the silver generation in a fun and engaging manner.

# GOMO Donate Your Data

Encouraged by the results of our Singtel Digital Silvers Programme where seniors were able to pick up the necessary digital skills and knowledge to stay safe online, we piloted in February 2022 our Donate Your Data programme in Singapore with NTUC Health on our all-digital mobile brand GOMO. Launched as part of GOMO’s #DataForGood campaign, the movement rallies customers to make the online space a better one and encourage better mental and digital well-being for everyone. Complementing the Singtel Digital Silvers programme, GOMO customers who are mainly youth can now play a role in digital inclusion for seniors by donating their data to vulnerable seniors at their fingertips via the GOMO mobile app.

We consolidate and credit donated data every month into the Singtel prepaid hi! cards which we sponsor for the vulnerable seniors across the 13 NTUC Health SACs. We plan to extend the programme to all our customers and scale the programme to reach 10,000 seniors and beneficiaries across more SSAs. This will also enable our customers to play their part in building an inclusive digital society and draw more people into the Digital for Life national movement.

# Engaging migrant workers to stay digitally connected

There are more than one million migrant workers in Singapore. Together with the Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) and Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE), Singtel organised regular activities to engage and uplift their spirits during the pandemic. Online events had an entertaining line-up of artiste performances and games with prizes, and saw an average 120,000 viewership. These workers also received regular information on work safety, health, mental wellness and remittance.

Workers using our hi! prepaid mobile service enjoy free ethnic content movies and TV shows from their home countries when they top up their account. We also made mobile remittance hassle-free with Dash Remit on our mobile wallet service Singtel Dash via the hi! app.

This gives our migrant worker customers a convenient, safe and digital alternative to visiting physical retail stores especially during the pandemic.

# ONLINE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING

The proliferation of devices and social media has enabled people to stay in touch wherever they are, with instant access to information. But it also brought about challenges like increased instances of cyber bullying, access to inappropriate content and digital addiction to mobile devices and gaming. Increased digital learning since the pandemic also comes with more unregulated screen time and content access, thereby exacerbating online risks especially for the younger ones.

The Singtel Group recognises these unintended consequences in our industry. As a responsible corporate citizen and market leader, we play a proactive role in mitigating such risks through education and promotion of responsible digital citizenship and online safety among our customers, children and youths. Since 2015, our Digital Thumbprint programme has equipped more than 600,000 students, educators and parents in Singapore and Australia with skills and knowledge to stay safe online.

As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we assess ourselves based on internationally recognised frameworks and benchmarks such as Global Child Forum and the GSMA-UNICEF MO-CRIA: Child Rights Impact Self-Assessment Tool for Mobile Operators to keep abreast with the latest best practices in child online safety and what we as a telco can and should do in this space. We also work closely with national agencies in Singapore and the Office of the e-Safety Commissioner in Australia to ensure that our programmes meet changing needs and align with regulatory landscapes in our respective markets to keep online spaces safe, especially for the vulnerable children.

# Helping families manage digital risk in Singapore

Help123 is an integrated cyber wellness and digital parenting platform by TOUCH Community Services that is supported by Singtel. First launched as a pilot supported by NCSS in 2017, Help123 has since adapted to the growing needs of parents and caregivers to focus on providing comprehensive digital resources to help them manage cyber wellness issues faced by their young ones. The full suite of Help123 services offered covers a one-stop hotline (1800 6123 123) and email, knowledge and resource, and digital parenting webinars. Since its inception, Singtel has invested over S$1 million into this platform and its offering.

SINGAPORE TELECOMMUNICATIONS LIMITED

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022

# About this Report

Since the onset of the pandemic, we have noticed increased traffic to the Help123 website and email enquiries from parents who mostly sought help for their children’s excessive device usage. TOUCH has been organising online digital parenting webinars to equip parents with the knowledge and skills to protect and keep their children safe online. During the year, we reached over 5,500 parents and children, with more than 55% feeling that the sessions were better than other similar ones they attended. We also enhanced the website by integrating a chatbot to provide real-time support for parents, catering to the 1.5 times increased website traffic compared to previous year.

We also expanded our outreach efforts and worked with like-minded partners to reach out to more parent groups. For example, we collaborated with the People’s Association to increase the reach of our webinars to more parents and caregivers as well as Quality Check! to improve the quality of screen time for preschool children in Singapore.

# Our Sustainability Approach

# Empowering young Australians to be responsible digital citizens

We are committed to empowering young people to be safe and responsible while online, so that they can embrace digital technology, maximise its benefits, and achieve their full potential. Since 2013, our Optus Digital Thumbprint programme in Australia has been providing young people the tools they need for positive and responsible online experiences. Our programme is endorsed by the eSafety Commissioner as a Trusted eSafety provider and offered free to primary and secondary schools.

With young children spending more time online for school and recreation, the need for online safety education has never been greater. During the year, we expanded support for primary school children with facilitator-led workshops for students aged ten to 11, and new interactive workshops for children aged eight to nine.

# Climate Change & Environment

# People & Future of Work

# UNLOCKING DIGITAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

Besides access, it is equally important that people and businesses possess the right skills and knowledge to effectively harness the benefits of digital technology. However, not all of them are equipped to do so. The media cited a survey which found that only two of five Singapore SMEs perceived their digital efforts to be successful, implying a lack of digital skills and knowledge hindering businesses’ digital transformation plans. Many SSAs also identified digital transformation as their top challenge. More than half of them wanted to continue digitising their operations beyond what they had implemented due to COVID-19. With our comprehensive suite of ICT solutions, Singtel is well placed to support these SMEs and SSAs and meet their digital needs.

# Community Impact

# Catalysing social innovation

Singtel Group Future Makers, our regional social innovation and capacity building programme, supports promising social impact start-ups with innovative technology solutions that help address social and healthcare challenges faced by the vulnerable in our communities. First started in Australia then Singapore, we have since expanded our local programmes and are working with our regional associates Airtel (India), AIS (Thailand), Globe (Philippines) and Telkomsel (Indonesia) to build collective impact in the social innovation space.

Since 2016, we have invested over S$5 million to support 72 local and regional start-ups through grants, capacity building and access to our ecosystem of partners and networking opportunities. In addition, employees who are subject matter experts in areas like digital marketing, HR, legal and strategy have been involved as mentors, coaches and judges as part of our skilled volunteering.

efforts to empower the start-ups. Read more about our Future Makers programme in Singapore here and Australia here.

In 2021, our programme sought to foster shared value opportunities with our regional associates to create impactful social and business solutions for our markets. Aligned with the SDGs, the programme showcased 20 regional start-ups that address key issues related to economic growth (SDG 8) and health and well-being (SDG 3) to impact investors, government agencies, NGOs and corporate partners. Our employees and partners across the Group also supported the start-ups through mentorships and workshops as part of their capacity building. Six start-ups subsequently secured a total grant pool of S$150,000 to support their regional shared value proposals to drive social and business impact. Moving ahead, we will work closely with high potential start-ups to catalyse shared value opportunities and help scale their solutions.

# Empowering SMEs to go digital

To support SMEs in Singapore on their digitisation journey, we launched a series of SME digitisation initiatives that offers ICT service consultation and support at no charge. During the year, more than 7,000 SMEs took part in the programme, with over 500 of them receiving one-on-one guidance from our digital specialists.

We guided SMEs on adopting IT solutions that supported secure and collaborative work processes while working from home, which was a norm during the pandemic. One such company is Yeng Management Services, an audit consultancy firm, which could not physically meet their clients and had to find alternative means to engage both clients and staff due to the safe management measures. Mr P G Wee, owner of Yeng Management Services, said that “these solutions enhanced the company’s efficiency through improved knowledge sharing and strengthened staff capabilities”.

# Singtel Group Future Makers alumni creating shared value

As one of Singapore’s leading remote rehabilitation start-ups, XCLR8 Technologies, our 2018 Singapore programme alumni and Singtel Group Future Makers 2021 regional finalist, partnered our long-time charity partner Singapore Cancer Society to co-develop a remote rehabilitation programme for cancer survivors. Through remote rehabilitation, patients are empowered to take control of their recovery and reduce the inconvenience brought about by commuting to clinics especially in their less-than-ideal physical condition.

Optus Future Maker Virtual Psychologist (2017) offers mental health and psychological counselling by text and chat with trained counsellors and psychologists. Challenged by staff experiencing anxiety during the pandemic, our Philippine associate Globe launched Hope Chat with Virtual Psychologist in the second quarter of 2021 to its 8,000 employees. It received a 97% satisfaction rate. Find out more about their work and other Singtel Group Future Makers 2021 start-ups here.

# Social Enterprise Champion of the Year

In recognition of our significant contributions made in helping social enterprises build capacity in Singapore, Singtel was named Social Enterprise Champion of the Year at the biennial President’s Challenge Social Enterprise Awards 2021. Singtel is honoured to be recognised for our support of the social enterprise sector in Singapore through Singtel Group Future Makers. Since our founding, we have strongly believed in harnessing the power of technology to empower generations of Singaporeans. We look forward to continue growing the programme with the help of our partners such as raiSE to support more social enterprises that share our vision.

# Supporting the next generation for innovative tech solutions

As part of NCS’ commitment to nurturing future IT talents, we supported Splash Awards 2021, a national student tech innovation competition organised by the Singapore Computer Society to inspire innovative ICT solutions in a fun and creative way. We adopted a challenge sub-theme where a senior leader served as a judge to assess the proposed solutions. We also organised the NCS Thinkathon where over 80 tertiary students put their heads together to create innovative solutions to tackle challenges faced by our communities.

# Supporting the education of vulnerable groups

Singtel Touching Lives Fund (STLF), our flagship corporate philanthropy programme, supports the education of children and youth with special needs in Singapore. Our six beneficiary schools are APSN Chaoyang School, APSN Tanglin School, APSN Delta Senior School, Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore School, Eden School and MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens School. They collectively support more than 3,000 students annually and provide customised curriculum to equip them with the knowledge and skills to integrate into the community and live independently. STLF has raised more than S$50 million since it was set up in 2002.

We recognise that play is important for children to grow and thrive but are also mindful of their health and safety. Due to safe management measures, we were unable to organise our annual mega Singtel Carnival for all the special education (SPED) schools in the past two years. However, before the year-end school holidays, we brought mini versions of the carnival to four of our STLF beneficiary schools for the younger children. We also made drawstring bags and reusable masks sporting an artwork design by an APSN Tanglin School budding student artist Shannon Kaur, and distributed them to every student in all the SPED schools in Singapore.

# EQUITY AND INCLUSION

The Singtel Group is dedicated to advancing vulnerable segments of society, including persons with disabilities, disadvantaged youths and Indigenous Australians so that they are empowered to reach their full potential. We continue to engage our people to make positive contributions by getting involved in our community programmes through fundraising, volunteerism and sharing their knowledge and expertise.

In Singapore, our community programmes and approach are aligned with NCSS’ Strategic Thrusts where every person is empowered to live with dignity in a caring and inclusive society. In recognition of our support for the sustainable progress in the development and inclusion of vulnerable groups in Singapore, Singtel was presented with the Community Chest Charity Platinum and Volunteer Partner Award 2021. We were also Singapore’s sole private sector representative that received recognition at the inaugural ASEAN Outstanding Social Welfare and Development Awards which recognises organisations with noteworthy contributions in the field of social welfare and development.

In Australia, our social impact initiatives focus on improving educational outcomes and employment pathways for disadvantaged and vulnerable youth. Optus has been a founding member company of the ABCN since 2005 and a partner of KARI Foundation.

# Community Impact

For the last few years, it’s been difficult for us to get our students to go to a carnival like this. I’d like to say a very big thank you to Singtel for bringing the carnival to us and allowing our students to expend their pent-up carnival excitement and have fun in a safe environment. Thank you for your continued contribution to the school and for serving the needs of all our students.

# Supporting pandemic recovery efforts

Singtel 40 staff volunteers supported Temasek Foundation’s Stay Prepared Programme to assist Singapore households in collecting their free disposal surgical and N95 masks. Singtel was also among a group of corporate donors in the Singapore business community to donate 3,000 oxygen concentrators to Indonesia in July 2021. The oxygen concentrators were used by hospitals to expand their oxygen care and treatment.

# NCS

In appreciation for the tireless efforts of our healthcare workers in Singapore during the pandemic, our NCS Healthcare team visited Tan Tock Seng Hospital to distribute 400 care packs to healthcare workers, nurses and doctors.

# Optus

We supported CARE Australia to raise funds to set up temporary hospitals in worst affected regions in India. Optus matched all staff donations one-for-one and provided a range of employee support for those personally impacted or have family and friends in India.

Aileen Tan, Group Chief People and Sustainability Officer, with the students from SPED schools at our decentralised Singtel Carnival 2021

Last year, we contributed S$100,000 to various assistance programmes like discount vouchers for groceries, back-to-school vouchers, funding support for bursaries and scholarships, and family recreation packages. This brings our total contribution to S$1.02 million since 2009.

In Australia, we work closely with ABCN and KARI Foundation to support high-needs schools by providing skills and work experience to help students grow their confidence and set career goals. During the year, about 250 Optus staff mentors supported more than 2,000 students across five states. We work within state-based COVID-19 restrictions and pivoted to virtual delivery where necessary to ensure continued reach and rapport with these students. Our ongoing partnership with the KARI Foundation provides scholarships and mentoring support for Indigenous students living in low socio-economic areas, who are entering their final years of high school.

# Advancing employability of disadvantaged population

As one of the founding members and current co-chair, Singtel participates actively in the Singapore Business Network on DisAbility. The network meets regularly to share expertise, experiences and resources to help advance the equitable inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of business. We also support national disability agency SG Enable’s mentorship and internship programmes for tertiary students with disabilities, as well as career fairs and CV clinics. Through our annual Pathways 2 Employment programme in Australia, we support disadvantaged youths in their transition from school to employment and improve their future employment prospects.

This initiative provides disadvantaged and vulnerable high school students with retail and employability skills, and the confidence to find and keep a job, both within Optus and the broader retail sector. During the year, we delivered eight workshops – reaching 300 students and placing 20 students in Optus retail employment opportunities.

# Engaging our people

Keeping our people actively engaged in the community is a key driver of our staff engagement and community impact strategy. We recognise our employees possess skills, networks and resources to empower vulnerable segments in the community. Employee volunteerism not only helps our communities but also contributes to the holistic development of our people in terms of empathy, perspective and character building.

During the year, we received the Community Cares Award from the Ministry of Social and Family Development, which recognised the efforts of Singtel and our staff volunteers who spent time during the pandemic to connect with vulnerable groups, checking in on their well-being. Optus was also recognised by Good Company Top 10 Best Workplaces in Australia for giving back to the community.

# Fundraising

Our annual flagship STLF event, Singtel Charity Golf, returned after a skip year in 2020 due to the pandemic. Despite a much pared down affair due to safe management measures and restrictions, we raised S$700,000 for children and youth with special needs, thanks to the generosity of our business partners.

As the title sponsor of Race Against Cancer (RAC) since 2009, employees were encouraged to participate in RAC 2021 virtual race and set up their own fundraising campaign to support Singapore Cancer Society’s Help the Children and Youth Programme. Singtel makes an annual S$250,000 donation to this programme, which provides support and financial assistance to children and youth who are cancer patients or whose family members are cancer patients. Our senior management teams in Singtel and NCS also took part in RAC 2021 and raised an additional S$200,000-plus.

In Australia, yes4good our online giving and volunteering platform helps our employees support causes close to their hearts through volunteering, donations and fundraising. We match staff donations and fundraising up to $300 per person per year. During the year, we conducted three fundraising campaigns and supported 288 charities through yes4good, with over A$300,000 in donations.

# Volunteering

With the transition towards living with COVID-19, our colleagues have gradually resumed their volunteering activities abiding by safe management measures. This includes conducting a mix of small groups in-person and virtual volunteering activities.

# Community Impact

In Singapore, we encourage our people to volunteer individually or as a team by offering paid volunteer leave, and encouraging business units to adopt VolunTeaming, our concept of department teambuilding with a volunteering element.

More than 40 colleagues from our Group Corporate Office participated in the Singtel Digital Silvers Programme to educate 80 seniors on digital literacy. James Tran, Senior Director of Transformation, together with his Group Procurement colleagues, signed up for a session to connect with seniors at the MacPherson Senior Activity Centre. James was paired with Shirley, a 75-year-old grandmother who lives on her own. He advised Shirley on how to avoid scams and better connect with her friends through different apps and functions, among others. Through the experience, James was grateful for the opportunity to make a difference to the seniors. It also enabled him and his colleagues to live out Singtel’s purpose to Empower Every Generation simply yet meaningfully.

He reports directly to the Board Risk Committee on risks associated with personal data and solutions to mitigate these risks.

# b. Staff education and training

All employees are required to undergo annual mandatory online training and tested on their subject knowledge. We conduct data privacy and security refresher training and share data handling tips regularly through various outreach channels to strengthen our people’s cyber security awareness and the importance of data privacy and protection in their daily work. We carry out phishing email simulation exercises and training throughout the year to improve employees’ knowledge on identifying phishing emails. We also regularly update the content of our phishing programme to reflect emerging and evolving phishing tactics and scams.

# c. Business risk assessments

We conduct data protection compliance assessments regularly to help identify and mitigate our data protection risks. We also run regular compliance checks on our business processes to ensure they adhere to the relevant data privacy and protection laws. As part of our internal controls system and governance process, all application systems are subjected to regular testing and security reviews before they go into production and their launch.

Our Internal Audit department also conducts regular audits on the IT systems and telecommunications infrastructure underpinning the Singtel Group. These audits focus on providing independent assurance on the control environment, considering cyber security, data privacy and operational risks. Management is responsible for acknowledging the identified areas of improvement and establishing mitigation plans. Internal Audit also provides control advisory reviews to support management in the assessment of controls design for new programmes and initiatives.

In addition, we have a Third-Party Service Provider Security Risk Governance Programme that assesses our third-party vendors’ cyber security practices. These reviews ensure that their cyber security practices adhere to Singtel’s cyber security requirements and regulations. To protect data, we limit staff access to information residing on our systems and vendor systems. There are also strict verification processes in place to prevent unauthorised information access.

# d. Customer empowerment

Cyber crimes are on the rise globally. To protect our customers, we send regular scam alerts to remind customers to stay vigilant and protect themselves against scams.

We conduct our marketing activities in accordance with the Do Not Call provisions of the PDPA and the Spam Control Act in Singapore. Customers who wish to opt out of receiving promotional messages or marketing calls can contact our customer hotline at 1688 or manage their preferences via our customer portal, Singtel My Account. In Australia, we meet our obligations under the Privacy Act and Privacy Provisions of the Telecommunications Act, the Spam Act and Do Not Call Register. We continuously enhance our processes and internal controls to protect customer data.

In FY2022, we recorded seven privacy incidents in Singapore, of which one was referred by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). These incidents were mainly due to human and process errors, as well as not following standard operating procedures. Employees involved have been coached and process lapses rectified.

We send regular reminders to our customer care officers on proper and careful management of customer data to prevent recurrence of such incidents. During the year, PDPC did not impose fines or non-monetary sanctions against Singtel. In May 2022, PDPC found that Singtel was not in breach of the PDPA in relation to a third-party file sharing system data incident in 2021 which we reported in SR2021.

In Australia, there were 130 customer data complaints that have been categorised as privacy incidents. Of this, four cases were referred by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) and one case from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). We met the threshold to notify the OAIC on one occasion and reported a Notifiable Data Breach during the year.

# Ethical and fair business practices

Ethical and fair business practices are critical to building trust and loyalty with our customers. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of business conduct and this is supported by our two core values — Operate with Integrity and Make Customers First — which we expect employees to embrace and demonstrate in their work to ensure that we operate responsibly, ethically and with integrity in everything we do. We also incorporate these values into our processes and decision making.

# Upholding human rights

We are committed to upholding and protecting the human rights of all individuals through a culture of trust, respect and inclusion in our company, supply chains and the markets where we operate, regardless of backgrounds, beliefs and abilities. During the year, we officially published our Singtel Group Human Rights Statement. As a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2007, we conduct business in line with its Ten Principles and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

We are also guided by international human rights principles set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This applies to how we operate and shape positive sustainable change for our business, employees, customers, communities and the environment.

# Fair marketing communications

We are committed to fair marketing practices and being clear and transparent in the way we communicate with customers, which can build trust and loyalty. To achieve this, we have incorporated a marketing code into the Singtel Code of Conduct. The marketing code sets out the requirements that Singtel organisations and representatives must follow to ensure that all marketing activities comply with various laws and guidelines such as the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice and PDPA.

There were no cases of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning marketing communications during the year. However, the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS) raised four cases from customers who felt that our advertised promotions were not clear or could be misleading. We explained our position to ASAS, and were reminded to be mindful of presenting key Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) to customers in an upfront and accessible manner.

We took our customer feedback onboard and will ensure that details of future campaigns, including T&Cs, are placed clearly on our website and app. The same information will be disseminated to our customer care officers who can clarify with customers who enquire.

# Community Impact

We also remain committed to addressing modern slavery across our supply chains. In Australia, we published our second Modern Slavery Statement and supported the Telco Together Foundation in publishing an Industry Statement on human rights and modern slavery. In partnership with Supply Nation, we now have access to more than 3,000 Indigenous suppliers, allowing us to explore opportunities to support Indigenous businesses across Australia. Internally, we continue to build staff awareness through modern slavery training modules, highlighting the role Optus plays in reducing modern slavery risks in our supply chains.

# Anti-bribery and corruption

The Singtel Group does not tolerate fraud, corruption and unethical behaviour in any form. We manage our exposure to corruption risks through good corporate governance and applying robust internal controls. Our management of fraud risk is supported by various policies and programmes applied across the Group. Our employees, contractors and business partners are expected to comply with these policies. For example, our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, together with the various Code of Conduct in place at all Group entities, mandates that Singtel Board members, management, employees and third parties who represent us, such as suppliers, contractors and business partners, observe our approach to bribery and corruption.

Our Whistleblower Programme, comprising an independent whistleblower hotline operated by external service providers in Singapore and Australia and supported by relevant Group policies such as the Singtel Group Investigation Policy and Singtel Group Whistleblower Policy, strengthens our internal control environment. Please refer to our Corporate Governance website for more information.

Every year, employees undergo mandatory online refresher courses on Code of Conduct, Fraud Awareness and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, and are required to declare any conflict of interest. We review these courses periodically to ensure content relevance. Regular communications and case studies are also sent for staff awareness, reminder and compliance.

If an allegation of corrupt conduct is received, a specialist team will conduct an independent investigation. Should an incident involving corrupt or fraudulent conduct by an employee be substantiated, we will take appropriate disciplinary action, including termination of employment, and report the matter to the relevant law enforcement authority as necessary.

All vendors must comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct. If we establish that a vendor is involved in corrupt or fraudulent activity, we will terminate the contract and bar the vendor from future procurement activity.

During the year, we received 85 reports via our whistleblower channels regarding various allegations, including employee misconduct. We also received 119 allegations of fraud-related and similar matters via other channels, such as compliance checks and investigations by law enforcement agencies (see Table 1 and 2).

In total, 66 cases were substantiated, while another 72 were not. 59 cases remained under investigation as at 31 March 2022. In addition, we closed 33 matters received in the prior year that were still under investigation as at 31 March 2021, of which 22 cases were substantiated. There were no investigations into matters that took place outside Singapore and Australia.

# Responsible tax management

We recognise that tax contributions are important to public finances and the social programmes they fund, and the Singtel Group is committed to complying with applicable tax laws of the jurisdictions where we operate.

The Board is responsible for risk governance and assisted by the Audit Committee in the oversight of tax matters. As part of sound tax governance, we have in place a Tax Risk Management Framework which is aligned to our Group’s risk management philosophy and approach. This framework formalises our tax risk management practices and guides our management and tolerance of tax risks. It sets a coordinated approach in our identification, management and mitigation of tax risks and promotes responsible tax management. The Group Chief Financial Officer, under the appointment by the Audit Committee and supported by Vice President of Group Tax, supervises the framework practices and effectiveness. For more information, please refer to our Responsible Tax Management Statement.

Optus is categorised as a Key Taxpayer for income tax by the Australian Tax Office and is subject to its annual Pre-lodgement Compliance Review. Optus is a signatory of the Board of Taxation’s voluntary Tax Transparency Code and has been publishing Tax Transparency Reports since 2018. The latest Optus Tax Transparency Report 2021 outlines the policy, strategy and governance for our Australian operations.

It also highlights our contribution to corporate income tax, effective tax rate and reconciliations of accounting profit to income tax expense and tax payable in Australia.

# Responsible Supply Chain Management

Sustainable supply chain management

The Singtel Group has an extensive supply chain ranging from mobile and network equipment, and infrastructure suppliers to content providers, security and managing agents.

During the year, the Singtel Group engaged 5,628 suppliers to procure products and services across our businesses. With a wide footprint spanning multiple countries and the complex nature of our supply chain, we recognise the importance of sourcing responsibly.

# Sustainable Value Creation

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2022

to minimise negative impact to the environment while contributing positively to the markets we operate in. We continue to execute our sustainable supply chain strategy while adapting to an evolving business environment amid the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the Ukraine conflict on our supply chain.

We enhanced our sustainability risk assessment framework that was developed in FY2020, based on the strategic importance of suppliers and key factors such as spend, tenure and country and category risks. The enhanced framework now has added focus on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy as well as data privacy. We considered the results from our supplier sustainability and life cycle assessments in FY2021. We will be implementing targeted intervention programmes based on the assessment outcome and internal risk mitigation considerations. Our objective is to support our suppliers in integrating sustainable practices into their business processes. Next year, we plan to implement a platform to automate the way we engage suppliers and build on that to include our supplier assessment, intervention and education programme, as well as improve transparency of supplier risks. We also plan to expand our assessment scope by incorporating elements of third-party validation and external risk assessment platforms.

On the climate front, we completed a baseline assessment of our Scope 3 carbon footprint, which is the aggregated indirect GHG emissions from our entire value chain and classified into 15 categories like ‘Purchased goods and services’ and ‘Transportation and distribution’ based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This exercise helped us to understand the primary drivers of GHG emissions in our business operations and value chain, and prioritise carbon reduction areas.

In the area of responsible sourcing, we continue to integrate sustainability considerations in our sourcing requirements especially for critical spend areas with significant environmental impact. For example, in building and designing our new data centres, we have incorporated comprehensive end-to-end sustainability criteria in our infrastructure and technology, as well as operations and maintenance, which are benchmarked against global standards. We have also begun pilot reviews for establishing a framework in the new year to incorporate shadow carbon pricing in our sourcing evaluation and decision-making. All new suppliers are assessed against ESG criteria through our sustainability questionnaire as part of their onboarding tender process. This is applied to tenders above $200,000 across the Singtel Group. 100% of such new suppliers were assessed against the criteria during the year.

# Workplace safety and health

Workplace safety and health (WSH) is our top priority and we strive to inculcate good safety habits and practices among our suppliers and contractors to ensure that all work activities are carried out safely. We engage only qualified contractors who meet our stringent safety requirements during the tender process and ensure that they maintain high WSH standards for all their activities (see Table 3).

We also maintained our ISO 45001 certification, an international ISO standard that provides the framework for organisations to improve workers’ health and safety, reduce risks and create safer working conditions.

# Fostering partnerships and collaboration

We collaborate with internal and external stakeholders on WSH risks and opportunities. To address fall from height risks of our contractors appointed to install 5G equipment on rooftops, we collaborated with Ericsson to test a new remote monitoring system during the year. A compact camera system was deployed at one of the work sites, with footage streamed live and recorded. This system, which can support multiple locations and users, will be deployed to more sites. Benefits of this technology solution include improvements to remote site surveillance and productivity since our WSH teams do not need to be physically present when contractors are carrying out work.

# Building our 5G leadership and driving industry adoption

5G will have a profound impact on our lives, as it forms the backbone of the digital economy as well as smart cities and nations. As a key pillar of our strategic reset, the Singtel Group aims to leverage the potential of 5G to transform business models and deliver enhanced products and services on an unprecedented scale, creating positive impact for our communities.

In May 2021, we launched our 5G standalone network, offering customers early access to the most advanced 5G connectivity with twice the responsiveness, faster uploads, strengthened authentication and encryption capability. In collaboration with Ericsson, we became the first in Southeast Asia to achieve download speeds of 5.4 Gbps.

We collaborated with National Gallery Singapore to deliver cultural and art experiences leveraging our 5G standalone network. Artists now have a wider platform to share their work, thus helping to develop the arts and culture scene in Singapore.

# INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE STATEMENT

Independent Limited Assurance Statement in connection with the Subject Matter included in the Sustainability Report of Singapore Telecommunications Limited (“Singtel Group”) for the financial year ended 31 March 2022

# Scope

We have been engaged by Singtel Group to perform a ‘limited assurance engagement’, as defined by International Standards on Assurance Engagements, here after referred to as the engagement, to report on the Sustainability Report of Singapore Telecommunications Limited (“Singtel”) and Singtel Optus Pty Ltd (“Optus”) (Collectively referred to as “Singtel Group”) as set out in the Subject Matter and Criteria section (the “Subject Matter”) as below as of 24 June 2022 financial year ended 31 March 2022 (“FY2022”) (“the Sustainability Report”).

# Subject Matter and Criteria

In preparing the Subject Matter, Singtel applied the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards (“the Criteria”) as set out in the table below:

|ESG Topics|GRI Topic-Specific Disclosure|“Shall” requirements under each disclosure|
|---|---|---|
|Climate change and carbon; Climate and infrastructure resilience; Water management (non-material)|GRI (2016) 302-1**|1. Total fuel consumption within the organisation from non-renewable sources, in joules or multiples, and including fuel types used.
2. Total fuel consumption within the organisation from renewable sources, in joules or multiples, and including fuel types used.
3. In joules, watt-hours or multiples, the total: 1. Electricity consumption
2. Heating consumption
3. Cooling consumption
4. Steam consumption
4. In joules, watt-hours or multiples, the total: 1. Electricity sold
2. Heating sold
3. Cooling sold
4. Steam sold
5. Total energy consumption within the organisation, in joules or multiples.
6. Standards, methodologies, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used.
7. Source of the conversion factors used.
2.1 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-1, the reporting organisation shall: 1. avoid the double-counting of fuel consumption, when reporting self-generated energy consumption. If the organisation generates electricity from a non-renewable or renewable fuel source and then consumes the generated electricity, the energy consumption shall be counted once under fuel consumption;
2. report fuel consumption separately for non-renewable and renewable fuel sources;
3. only report energy consumed by entities owned or controlled by the organisation;
4. calculate the total energy consumption within the organisation in joules or multiples using the following formula: Total energy consumption within the organisation = Non-renewable fuel consumed + Renewable fuel consumed + Electricity, heating, cooling, and steam purchased for consumption + Self-generated electricity, heating, cooling, and steam, which are not consumed (see clause 2.1.1) – Electricity, heating, cooling, and steam sold.
|
| |GRI (2016) 302-3**|1. Energy intensity ratio for the organisation.
2. Organisation-specific metric (the denominator) chosen to calculate the ratio.
3. Types of energy included in the intensity ratio; whether fuel, electricity, heating, cooling, steam, or all.
4. Whether the ratio uses energy consumption within the organisation, outside of it, or both.
2.5 When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 302-3, the reporting organisation shall: 1. calculate the ratio by dividing the absolute energy consumption (the numerator) by the organisation-specific metric (the denominator);
2. if reporting an intensity ratio both for the energy consumed within the organisation and outside of it, report these intensity ratios separately.

# “Shall” requirements under each disclosure

# 2.3

When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-2, the reporting organisation shall:

1. exclude any GHG trades from the calculation of gross energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions;
2. exclude other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions that are disclosed as specified in Disclosure 305-3;
3. account and report energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions based on the location-based method, if it has operations in markets without product or supplier-specific data;
4. account and report energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions based on both the location-based and market-based methods, if it has any operations in markets providing product or supplier-specific data in the form of contractual instruments.

- Gross other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
- If available, the gases included in the calculation; whether CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, or all.
- Biogenic CO2 emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
- Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions categories and activities included in the calculation.
- Base year for the calculation, if applicable, including:
1. the rationale for choosing it;
2. emissions in the base year;
3. the context for any significant changes in emissions that triggered recalculations of base year emissions.
- Source of the emission factors and the global warming potential (“GWP”) rates used, or a reference to the GWP source.

# Management’s and Board of Director’s responsibilities

The Management is responsible for selecting Criteria, and for presenting the Subject Matter in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# EY’s responsibilities

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Subject Matter based on the procedures we performed and evidence we obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’), International Standard for Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (‘ISAE3410’) and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with Singtel Group on 8 April 2022, supplemental to the principal agreement dated 1 April 2020. Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusions.

# Our independence and quality control

We have maintained our independence and confirm that we have met the requirements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. EY also applies Singapore Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

# Description of procedures performed

Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.

Although we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.

The GHG quantification process is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement of GHGs. Additionally, GHG procedures are subject to estimation (or measurement) uncertainty resulting from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.
