Sustainability Report 2022

# C E O M E S S A G E

Dear Shareholders & Readers,

I am pleased to present the second edition of our standalone Sustainability Report. Over the past year, we remained committed to ensuring that our business operations align with sustainable practices. We identify actions that will contribute to a sustainable future by implementing measures to minimise our carbon footprint, reduce waste, conserve resources, and foster a culture of diversity and inclusion within our company and where we operate.

As we all know, the semiconductor industry plays a vital role in driving technological innovation and economic growth. However, we are also aware of the environmental and social challenges that come with this responsibility. Today, the semiconductor industry and the world are dealing with unusual levels of volatility and uncertainty. Even in challenging times, it's important we remain focused on our RISE (Resilience, Innovation, Sustainability, and Entrepreneurship) principles and lead where we can.

AEM is deeply committed to upholding the highest ethical and legal standards in all the jurisdictions where we operate. In our fiscal year 2022, we proudly recorded zero significant instances of non-compliance. We firmly believe that compliance is an essential element of our sustainability journey, and we remain steadfast in ensuring that all our operations are compliant with the relevant regulatory requirements.

We have taken concrete steps to transition towards renewable energy sources. To this end, in the fiscal year 2022, we purchased 10,000 Renewable Energy Certificates ("RECs"), accounting for a remarkable 56% of our total electricity consumption, marking a notable increase from the 6,000 RECs we procured in the fiscal year 2021. Additionally, we installed solar panels at CEI Pte. Ltd.'s ("CEI") Singapore plant, which is estimated to generate close to 240,000 kWh of electricity annually, equivalent to approximately 45% of CEI Singapore plant's average annual electricity consumption. This move signifies a significant stride in our journey towards reducing our carbon footprint and embracing sustainable energy sources.

Our commitment to sustainability can only be achieved by first ensuring that our employees are safe and healthy. We continue to make great strides in improving our safety measures, but we must remain vigilant and continuously work to identify and mitigate potential hazards. The Workplace Safety and Health Group leads our efforts in this by conducting regular safety training programmes, drills, monthly safety inspections, orientation, and briefings, and more.

AEM's commitment to integrating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations into our business strategy has been recognised with a BBB rating (on a scale of AAA - CCC) in the MSCI ESG Ratings assessment in 2022. This rating underscores our resilience to long-term, financially relevant ESG risks, highlighting our unwavering dedication to sustainable practices. We are proud that our efforts have been acknowledged, and this rating serves as a testament to our commitment to achieving sustainable growth while upholding ESG best practices.

# Sustainability Commitments for a better future

Our sustainability journey is an ongoing process, and we recognise that there is still more work to be done and accomplished. Our focus goes beyond delivering high-quality products and services to our customers; it extends to ensuring that we do so in a socially equitable and environmentally responsible manner. In our product design strategy and development, we ensure that each product delivers and achieves a maximum positive environmental impact for our customers.

Another core ESG programme that we continue to focus on is to create a workplace culture that is inclusive and empowering. This includes programmes to build and nurture talents to groom to bring additional diversity to AEM’s management.

As we accelerate our growth to be the leader in Test 2.0, we uphold our RISE principles to align our decision-making. Thank you for your continued support as we work towards building a more sustainable future.

# ABOUT THIS REPORT

AEM Holdings Ltd. (“AEM” or the “Company”) is pleased to present the Company’s annual Sustainability Report (the “Report”).

# Reporting Period and Scope

The Report provides a comprehensive summary of AEM’s key sustainability issues, our management approach, and our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) policies, practices, and performance over the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 (“FY2022”). As part of AEM’s ongoing objective to maintain operational excellence in sustainability, we have also established short-, long-term and perpetual targets for each of the ESG factors assessed to be material to the Group’s internal and external stakeholders.

In line with SGX Listing Rules 711A and 711B, we have also incorporated the six primary components in our annual sustainability report, on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. We plan to work on developing a more comprehensive climate action strategy that is consistent with the recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) in the near future, after building our in-house capabilities for climate reporting.

# Assurance

This Report has not been externally assured, but an internal review of AEM’s FY2022 sustainability reporting processes has been completed. We have relied on our internal verification mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of the data presented in this Report, all of which has been disclosed voluntarily and in good faith.

# Sustainability Reporting Framework

This Report has been prepared with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, an internationally recognised sustainability reporting framework that offers comprehensive guidance on how businesses can communicate their impacts on people and planet in a global common language. From this Report, we have updated the content to be in line with the GRI Universal Standards 2021. The GRI Content Index is contained on pages 45 to 47, indicating the location of all applicable disclosures within the Report.

# Board Statement

The Board of Directors (the "Board") is pleased to present AEM’s Sustainability Report for FY2022, demonstrating our continued commitment to clearly and accurately communicating our ESG impact to our stakeholders. Our sustainability report provides a comprehensive overview of our progress, challenges, and goals, and we are committed to continuously improving our practices to meet the evolving needs of our stakeholders.

As we continue to grow our operations, we keep ourselves conscious of our business’ impact on the environment and the communities in which we operate, and cognisant of how sustainability issues may affect our strategy and operations in the long run. The Board works closely with the management to ensure that our business practices are aligned with the RISE principles (Resilience, Innovation, Sustainability, and Entrepreneurship).

We do so by considering ESG issues as part of our strategy formulation, with a specific focus on the following three areas:

1. Conducting and operating our business lawfully and ethically
2. Reducing the adverse environmental impact of our business activities within the communities we work and live in
3. Fulfilling our social responsibilities to our employees, customers, and local communities

We are proud of the progress AEM has made in addressing the ESG factors we have determined to be material to the Group’s stakeholders. In addition to purchasing 10,000 Renewable Energy Certificates in Singapore, we have installed solar panels at CEI’s Singapore plant, doing our part in helping Singapore achieve its climate ambitions. AEM also continues to do our part in promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion within the semiconductor industry, sponsoring the second edition of the Semiconductor Women's Forum held by the Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association (“SSIA”) and organising a panel discussion on ‘Empowering Women in STEM’ at SEMICON SEA 2022 in Penang. We recognise, however, that there is more work to be done, and the Board will continue to play a key role in overseeing the management and monitoring of AEM’s material ESG factors, as we continue to progress in our sustainability journey.

In line with our corporate vision and mission, the Board is dedicated to promoting sustainable growth and responsible business practices, and we encourage our employees, business partners, and other stakeholders to join us in this important mission.

Sincerely,

Board of Directors

Firm leadership, a robust corporate governance framework, and an ethical organisational culture, supported by sound policies and processes, are vital for AEM to sustain our standing as a world-class technological equipment manufacturer and service provider.

AEM is committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance. To this end, it has established an effective and holistic enterprise risk management system to bolster the resilience and agility of its businesses. AEM’s strategy and decision-making is informed by business ethics, financial discipline, and risk management, as the Group strives to create long-term value for our stakeholders.

# Corporate Governance and Anti-Corruption (GRI 205-1)

As testimony of the Company’s staunch commitment to conducting and operating our businesses in a lawful and ethical manner, we have rolled out the AEM Code across AEM and AEM’s global subsidiaries. Every employee, including the management team and the Board, is required to read, understand, and comply with the provisions of the AEM Code, which sets forth the high standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethics we expect our employees and business partners to uphold. Besides our employees, the AEM Code has been communicated to our customers, suppliers and/or other third parties, and is publicly available on our corporate website. We also conduct compliance trainings for our employees as and when required to increase general compliance knowledge and awareness. In FY2022, we engaged a law firm to provide sanctions and export controls training for relevant employees.

AEM has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of bribery, corruption, extortion and embezzlement. To maintain the highest standards of integrity and accountability, the Group has developed and circulated our internal policies and procedures on anti-bribery and anti-corruption to all our employees. Our Whistle-Blowing Policy, also available on our corporate website, provides a channel for employees and third parties to voice their concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting, workplace safety, or other matters to the Audit and Risk Management Committee (“ARC”), in confidence and without fear of reprisal.

All operations at AEM, including our manufacturing and production sites in Singapore, Malaysia, China, U.S.A, Finland, France, Vietnam, and Indonesia, have

|Material Topic|FY2022 Performance|Perpetual Targets|
|---|---|---|
| |Zero significant incidents of non-compliance with governmental laws and regulations in environmental, social, and economic areas|To have zero substantiated cases of corruption or other improprieties|
|Corporate Governance and Anti-Corruption| |To maintain our overall compliance record and have zero significant public legal cases brought against the Group|

been assessed for risks related to corruption, and zero significant incidents of corruption were identified in FY2022.

For the long-term financial stability and profitability of the Company, it is vital that AEM invests heavily in its research and development (“R&D”) efforts to stay ahead of the competition. With the expansion of our manufacturing sites in Singapore, Malaysia, and the U.S.A, we are expecting a corresponding increase in our R&D capabilities that would allow us to bolster the efficiency, manageability, safety, and security of AEM’s next-generation manufacturing systems and test capabilities.

Employees who encounter any conflict of interest(s) are required to report the matter to the Group via the annual conflict of interest declaration exercise. All transactions with interested persons are to be promptly reported to the ARC as well. Subsequently, internal controls will be established to ensure that all transactions are carried out on an arm’s length basis, without prejudice to the interests of any shareholders. In compliance with SGX Listing Rule 1207(19), the Group has also devised and adopted our own internal compliance code to provide guidance to our employees, with regards to dealing in AEM’s securities.

To date, there has been no reports of significant improprieties concerning AEM’s business practices and operations, and zero significant legal and regulatory non-compliance incidents in FY2022. The Group will continue to be vigilant in ensuring that our employees uphold the highest standards of integrity when dealing with customers, vendors, government agencies, and within the Group.

# Economic Performance

The Group’s revenue has reached a record high of S$870.5 million in FY2022. The growth in top and bottom line were achieved on the back of strong demand from customers. Driven by strong revenue growth, our net profit (after tax) has also increased from S$92.1 million in FY2021 to S$127.3 million in FY2022.

AEM is firmly committed to generating positive economic value for our stakeholders, by delivering best-in-class technologies and solutions for advanced, integrated semiconductor test needs and providing the best service to our customers. In this way, the Company will be able to stay at the forefront of technological innovation within the semiconductor and electronic testing space in the long run.

# Environmental Conscientiousness

It is our belief that sustainable environmental practices can go hand in hand with corporate growth. Our goal is thus to align our operational practices with international standards and industry best practices for environmental management systems. We strive to minimise the adverse environmental impact of our business activities by improving the resource efficiency of our daily operations and developing a sustainable supply chain.

# Sustainable Supplier Management (GRI 308-1, 414-1)

Effective two-way communication with our suppliers throughout the entire procurement process, is key to promoting trust, improving risk management, and supporting AEM’s long-term goals. As part of our stringent supplier selection process, all new key suppliers will be screened for significant negative environmental and social impacts resulting from their business operations before they become an approved AEM vendor. As outlined in our supplier screening guide, this includes incidents of child labour, non-discrimination, pollution (land, air, water, and noise), energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and environmental area. By assessing their track record in these various aspects, we are thus able to ensure that all AEM-approved vendors will complement our commitment to delivering high-quality products and services.

# Supplier Environmental Assessment (GRI 308-1)

Our new key supplier is screened using our supplier screening guide which lists out relevant environmental criteria to meet our Environmental Management System requirements for the products and services they supply. Our existing key suppliers are either compliant with industry standards such as ISO14001 or have published their environmental policy and/or sustainability report, in addition to having had zero significant incidents of non-compliance with local environmental laws.

# Supplier Social Assessment (GRI 414-1)

Similarly, a social assessment of our new key supplier was conducted using our supplier screening guide, through which we have determined that our new key supplier is compliant with social industry standards, in line with AEM requirements.

# Material Topic

# FY2022 Performance

The majority of AEM’s key suppliers entered into contractual commitments with AEM to conduct their business in accordance with applicable ESG laws, regulations, industry codes, practices and standards; and minimise or eliminate any negative ESG impacts from their business operations. All key suppliers also participated in AEM Sustainability declarations to provide updates with regards to their continuous alignment with AEM’s environmental and social requirements, having either aligned their business practices with industry standards such as the ISO14001 or published their environmental policy or sustainability report in the public domain.

# Perpetual Targets

- Screen 100% of new key suppliers using environmental and social criteria
- Enhance our supply chain management assessment processes to strengthen our evaluation of suppliers’ environmental and social practices

# Minimising Our Environmental Footprint

# Energy

(GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-4)

Energy is crucial to AEM’s business activities. Though the use of energy-intensive equipment results in higher utility costs, our manufacturing operations would be disrupted without them, owing to the specialised nature of our business.

Our subsidiary, CEI, has installed solar panels on its Singapore plant during the year, which will be able to generate close to 240,000 kWh of electricity a year, for our own consumption, equivalent to approximately 45% of CEI Singapore plant’s average annual electricity consumption.

As part of our commitment to further reducing our environmental footprint, AEM purchased 10,000 Renewable Energy Certificates (“RECs”) in FY2022 (FY2021: 6,000 RECs). This is equivalent to approximately 56% of our total electricity consumption from conventional sources in FY2022.

Nevertheless, we recognise the importance of adopting cost-effective methods to improve energy efficiency and minimise energy consumption and wastage, to contribute to environmental sustainability efforts. On this front, we have implemented several continuous energy-saving initiatives across our Singapore headquarters and main global manufacturing entities, which include:

- replacing fluorescent lighting with LED energy-saving lighting,
- programming air-conditioner and lights to switch off automatically after office hours,
- switching the air-conditioning ducting from ceiling cassettes to inverters,
- replacing old, inefficient equipment with energy-efficient ones, and
- introducing usage discipline through posters and briefings to promote greater awareness on energy conservation among our employees.

AEM strives to adopt renewable energy as an integral part of our energy portfolio.

# AEM Holdings Ltd.

# Emissions (GRI 305-1, 305-2, 305-4)

Climate change poses a growing threat to the communities we work and live in. As part of a global effort to cut down on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, AEM has been monitoring our emission levels at every stage of our manufacturing process through data collection to identify areas with potential for significant reduction of GHG emissions. Given that indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy accounts for much of AEM’s carbon footprint, the efficient use of energy is essential to reducing AEM’s GHG emissions.

# The following table shows the emission intensity ratio for AEM.

| |FY2020|FY2021|FY2022|

# ENVIRONMENTAL CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

# Waste Management (GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-3)

AEM is conscious of the waste we have generated across the organisation, as input from our suppliers and output from our operations and manufacturing processes.

# Waste Generated

|Input (from Suppliers)|Activities (Manufacturing Processes)|Output|
|---|---|---|
|• Paper • Carton boxes • Chemical substances (Loctite, oil, etc.)|• Paper • Chemicals for cleaning, adhesion, lubrication|• Paper • Carton boxes • Used chemicals (Loctite, oil, coolant, etc.) • Soldering waste • Solder dross • Metal leftover|

In support of Singapore’s ambition of becoming a Zero Waste Nation, we have accelerated our efforts to reduce waste and promote sustainable waste management by:

- Converting several of our internal processes from paper-based records to electronic records;
- Engaging a third-party recycler to recycle waste generated from our manufacturing process and operations (e.g., metal leftovers generated from our manufacturing process);
- Reusing carton boxes and plastic pallets, and not using hydrofluoroether (HFE) in our new equipment.

We take a systematic approach to identify, manage, reduce, and responsibly dispose of or recycle the waste we generate. Overall, there are three main categories of waste at AEM: hazardous waste (which includes chemical waste), recycled waste (which includes leftover metals, paper, and plastic), and general waste, which accounts for the majority of the waste we generate.

# Total weight of waste generated (in metric tons)

|Category|FY2021|FY2022|

# Water Management (GRI 303-5)

Given the growing scarcity of water as a natural resource, AEM is committed to doing our part as responsible stewards of the global water supply.

In line with various national initiatives advocating for greater water reduction and conservation efforts, AEM has introduced the following measures at all our operating and manufacturing sites:

- Promote water conservation awareness among employees by displaying education posters and holding informative briefings on usage discipline;
- Replacing conventional water taps to motion sensor taps and spring faucets, to reduce water wastage and improve water efficiency.

Over the years, AEM has also been carefully monitoring and managing our water consumption levels. While there has been a significant increase in the Group’s total water consumption over the years, this can largely be attributed to an increase in the Group’s manufacturing and production activities, with our acquisition of CEI in FY2021 and our recent shift to a larger manufacturing space at AEM Penang. However, the amount of water consumed per monetary unit of sales has been relatively constant.

| |FY2020|FY2021|FY2022|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total Water Consumption from All Areas (m3)|16,328|49,967*|74,076|
|Water Consumed per Monetary Unit of Sales (m3/S$’000)|0.031|0.088|0.085|

In FY2022, AEM reviewed and further enhanced employee benefits for all our employees, to ensure adequate life and medical insurance coverage for all our employees and allow them a peace of mind in the event of a major illness.

AEM acknowledges that a good work-life balance is key to promoting staff wellbeing and satisfaction.

# Employment (GRI 401-1, 401-2)

The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed us to accelerate our digital transformation, changing the way we work. Our HR team has stepped up to lead this transformation by adapting the latest technologies to AEM’s advantage – helping to centralise processes, reinforce workforce abilities, improve candidate and employee experiences, and more.

As outlined in the AEM Code, we are committed to upholding our employees’ and prospective employees’ human rights, by adhering with strict labour standards on freely chosen employment, avoidance of child labour, non-discrimination, freedom of association, and human treatment, in accordance with local laws. Engaging in ethical and responsible labour practices is key to attracting – and retaining - a diverse pool of talent that can bring AEM into our next stage of sustainable growth.

To build and encourage employee loyalty, we provide employees with competitive compensation packages that comprise a base salary, and may also include allowance, cash bonuses, and/or a share equity plan. By including a strong variable component in employee remuneration, we can incentivise better performance, as employees’ total compensation will be determined by considering their individual expertise, job responsibility, and their long-term contributions to the Company’s growth. We have also presented long service awards to our long serving staffs as a recognition of their contribution and dedication.

To encourage employees to engage in health promoting activities on top of creating a positive and inclusive work culture, our team in AEM Penang and CEI Singapore have organised offsite teambuilding events, such as bowling tournaments and our team in Costa Rica have organised a family day in a wildlife rescue centre.

# SOLIDIFYING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

As of 31 December 2022, AEM’s workforce consists of 2,883 employees, an increase of 386 employees compared to the previous year due to our business expansion plans. We welcomed 592 new hires throughout the year, which represented a 49% increase from the total number of new hires in FY2021. AEM Penang has also partnered with InvestPenang, a set-up of the Penang State Government to assist in the recruitment of talent from the local community.

|Employee New Hires by gender|Male|Female|
|---|---|---|
|AEM Penang|37 (24%)|116 (76%)|
|FY2020|135 (34%)|263 (66%)|

AEM aims to further improve the gender ratio of our workforce by providing equal opportunities for all genders and hiring more females in the engineering field, particularly in regions with low female representation. This is evidenced by how the ratio of male to female new hires is steadily becoming more balanced over the years, decreasing from 3.14 in FY2020 to 1.63 in FY2022.

# Occupational Health & Safety

(GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-4, 403-6, 403-9, 403-10)

Our top priority is for our employees to feel safe at work and confident in executing their responsibilities. We have a designated Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Group to provide oversight over the Company’s occupational health and safety (“OH&S”) procedures and system. The WSH Group plays a key role in building a strong and positive safety culture in AEM, by conducting monthly safety inspections, scheduling safety trainings and drills, and filing emergency and accident reports with the relevant authorities, when necessary. They also reconvene each month to address any matters pertaining to occupational health and safety, including that of workers’ participation and communication.

We routinely monitor all work-related hazards and risks to ensure the safety of our team members, contractors, and other stakeholders who are working in our facilities. Guided by the hierarchy of controls, we have developed a safety manual that sets out the work safety procedures in place to control or eliminate potential safety hazards. In addition, we have also put in place a safety policy. We conduct routine safety orientations and toolbox briefings as well as internal risk assessment trainings for all AEM staff. In line with Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) Code of Practice, we also periodically review our risk assessment processes, using a 5x5 risk assessment matrix, to evaluate AEM’s occupational health and safety management practices.

# AEM Holdings Ltd.

Employees are encouraged to raise their concerns about any work-related hazards and hazardous situations directly to their superiors and/or safety committee members, or through an on-site suggestion box. Meetings are held with all staff, to encourage them to speak up by reporting hazardous situations and empower them to initiate improvements. The respective supervisors will monitor all feedback closely and take all necessary corrective measures.

We investigate the root cause and determine the appropriate corrective actions. We implement the necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of the issue and ensure that our safety management system is updated accordingly.

We also conduct regular safety audits and reviews to identify potential hazards and address any safety concerns before they result in incidents. We encourage open communication and feedback from employees to identify areas for improvement in our safety practices and procedures.

Smart cameras are being used in monitoring our equipment motion testing to reduce risks to test personnel.

In addition, we provide ongoing training and education to employees to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to work safely and prevent incidents from occurring. We also recognise and reward safe behaviours to encourage a culture of safety throughout the organisation.

With these measures in place, we maintained our record of having reported zero cases of recordable work-related ill health, zero cases of high-consequence work-related injuries, and zero cases of fatalities resulting from work-related injuries or ill health, for all employees and workers. There were four recordable work-related injuries that occurred in FY2022, which were minor injuries such as minor cuts and falls that do not cause significant harm. The affected workers have received all necessary medical attention.

We believe that a strong commitment to preventing the recurrence of safety issues is essential to the success of our organisation. By prioritising safety in all aspects of our business and continuously improving our safety management system, we can protect our employees, customers, and stakeholders, and create a safer and healthier workplace.

# Occupational Health and Safety

Our goal is to become a trusted partner to our customers, by assessing the health and safety impacts of our products and services, safeguarding customer confidentiality, and fulfilling customer demands. As highlighted in our Quality Policy Statement on our website, we are committed to continuous improvement and excellence in all that we do.

# Customer Health and Safety (GRI 416-1)

AEM’s key products and services include handling solutions, test solutions for Automated Testing Equipment and Precision Cables, as well as contract manufacturing services.

Across the Group, we have a standardised process for introducing new products into the market. All products are to undergo validation compliance checks against customer- and region-specific health and safety requirements, such as the SEMI-S2/S8 standard and CE compliance, before they will be qualified for shipment.

The health and safety impact of all products and services has been assessed. Since FY2019, there are no significant incidents of non-compliance with regulatory and/or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our products and services.

# Customer Privacy (GRI 418-1)

AEM is committed to protecting the personal information of the people with whom we do business, including our suppliers, customers, colleagues, and other stakeholders. We comply with all privacy and information security laws and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, and we maintain strict adherence to non-disclosure agreements with our business partners.

We closely monitor complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data, and we have not received any substantiated complaints on the matter since FY2019. We will ensure that the measures we have taken to protect our customer’s privacy and data continue to be compliant with the laws and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where we operate, and uphold our firm commitment to safeguarding our customer’s privacy and data.
