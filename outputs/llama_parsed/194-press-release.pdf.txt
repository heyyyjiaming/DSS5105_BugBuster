FY2023 ESG Impact Report

# LETTER FROM OUR GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Dear Stakeholders,

I am delighted to present our latest Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Impact Report for FY2023, titled “Enriching Lives, Emerging Stronger”. This theme embodies our unwavering commitment to working alongside our stakeholders and the broader ecosystem to develop the digital commerce industry, through every challenge and opportunity.

For more than a decade, Lazada has been accelerating progress in Southeast Asia through commerce and technology. With our second ESG Impact Report, I am proud to share the progress that we have made and am confident that we can achieve even more together.

This optimism is also captured in the theme of our report this year, as we focus on building back stronger than ever before and empowering our key stakeholders – our customers, brands and sellers, partners, employees and more.

Last year, we launched a new brand proposition, “Add to Cart, Add to Life”. This reflects our belief in the transformative power of digital commerce to enrich consumers’ lives through meaningful connections and memorable experiences beyond online purchases. With the launch, we also introduced LazLive+, a curated interactive live content series featuring new ideas and experts from all walks of lives, to inspire and meet the changing needs of consumers.

Across the markets where we operate, we have seen borders reopen, travel resume and life begin to return to pre-pandemic normality over the past year. The road to recovery, however, is dampened by the weight of a slowing global economy. Despite the uncertainties ahead, we are optimistic that the digital commerce industry will remain a bright spot as the main driver of Southeast Asia’s digital economy, which is expected to grow to $330 billion dollars by 2025.

For our valued brands and partners, we hosted the third edition of our annual marquee event, LazMall Brands Future Forum (BFF) 2022, themed “Empowering Connections through eCommerce”. Through insightful sharing and discussions, the event aimed to equip our brands with advanced digital tools and offerings available on LazMall, in response to changing needs of consumers, including the rise of omnichannel shopping and a much more complex and dynamic shopping journey.

We understand that people are the backbone of our business and we remain steadfast in enriching their work experience, while building up the skill sets and knowledge of our broader talent pool to remain resilient in a rapidly changing world. Our in-house digital learning platform, GROW, offers more than 1,000 interactive and engaging courses for our employees to develop themselves holistically.

Looking beyond our business, we also strive to drive inclusive and sustainable economic growth across the markets. We joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC 2022) Economic Forum to promote and support such initiatives across Southeast Asia, including efforts to support the digital transformation of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), where digitalization is crucial to improving the operational flexibility and long-term growth of businesses. In Vietnam, I am proud to share that our commitment to society was recognized last year when Lazada Vietnam received two prestigious Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) awards from The Saigon Times and AmCham Association.

As a leading and responsible brand, we are constantly looking for ways to improve and manage our environmental impact for future generations. This year, on top of improving existing sustainable initiatives across our supply chain, we also accelerated the introduction and implementation of electric vehicles in our operations and supported the transition to solar energy at our logistics facilities in Indonesia.

As we prepare for the rapidly evolving digital environment, we continue to strengthen our corporate governance framework and actively advocate for strong cybersecurity, data protection and intellectual property (IP) protection. We are proud to have achieved ISO27001 certification and the highest level, Advocate, of the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s Cyber Trust mark certification, ensuring the trust and confidence of customers and partners in our robust and secure platform.

As we move forward to our next stage of growth, sustainability will continue to be our guiding principle. The implementation of Lazada’s ESG framework will drive us toward being an exemplary company, demonstrating our responsibility and focus on sustainability for long-term prosperity. I am proud of the progress we have made, but I know there is more to do. This endeavor is a journey and not a destination.

By working together, we can enrich the lives of all participants in the digital economy and build toward a resilient and sustainable future.

# 5 QUESTIONS WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT

# Frank Luo (Chief Finance Officer) and Gladys Chun (General Counsel) share their perspectives on ESG matters.

|Frank Luo|Gladys Chun|
|---|---|
|Chief Finance Officer|General Counsel|
|Lazada Group|Lazada Group|

As Lazada publishes its second ESG Impact Report, what notable experiences or achievements have you encountered along the way that you are particularly excited to share?

Frank: Taking the first step is often the most challenging part of any journey. When we made the decision to embark on our ESG journey, we understood that it would be a complex and transformative process that requires substantial commitment. Nevertheless, we embraced this path voluntarily because we firmly believe it is the right thing to do. I am heartened to share that our Group’s overall carbon footprint has been reduced by 10% this year. This is an encouraging milestone for us as we start to see some of our initiatives bear fruit.

Gladys: We saw improved efficiencies from our logistics operations as the main lever that reduced our overall carbon footprint. This will continue to be a key focus for our business as we strive toward decarbonizing our operations and ecosystem. Parallelly, we are actively pursuing scale and impact across our other material topics and we will continue to share our progress and developments.

Ensuring the quality of ESG data is crucial to stakeholders. How does Lazada address the collection and maintenance of ESG data as well as the measures taken to ensure its accuracy and reliability?

Frank: ESG matters cover a broad range of issues. The underlying data depends on a vast spectrum of factors, much of which exists in narrative or unstructured form. These data are often scattered across various sources where data gaps exist. For Lazada, technology is the key enabler to address these challenges. We are working on several fronts to strengthen our processing capabilities, such as establishing new data pipelines, creating a strong data management system and utilizing available data to benchmark performance. These improvements would translate to consistent, high-quality ESG datasets over time. Looking ahead, there will be opportunities to adopt new and innovative ways to improve existing processes, such as using artificial intelligence and machine learning, to create truly data-driven, future-proof reporting for the future.

How does Lazada ensure the ESG framework captures the requirements of a changing compliance and regulatory reporting environment?

Gladys: Given our presence across six markets, it is essential to have a deep and comprehensive understanding of the regulatory landscapes we operate in. For example, we undertake regular landscape assessments, engage regulators and other key stakeholders proactively to understand their perspectives on emerging issues and leverage external channels such as industry associations to keep up-to-date. Our ESG framework acts as a governance mechanism that integrates relevant regulations and standards into its criteria and ensures that our practices comply with the applicable laws and regulations. This ensures our ESG framework remains relevant and effective in supporting our overall ESG strategy.

Frank: Addressing ESG issues is not just about doing the right thing. It is also building the necessary foundation for organizations to properly manage risks and opportunities, to enable stronger and more resilient businesses in the long run.

I am heartened to share that our Group’s overall carbon footprint has reduced by 10% this year. This is an encouraging milestone for us as we start to see some of our initiatives bear fruit.

As Southeast Asia’s leading digital commerce platform, we contribute to the economic progress of the region, supporting the communities we operate in with employment opportunities, services and capacity-building initiatives throughout our network.

During this reporting period, we deftly navigated the transition from a pandemic-stricken landscape to a renewed chapter of economic expansion and prosperity. Through active engagement and empowerment of our communities with the right tools and services, we further their sustainable growth alongside our business.

# OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS LAZADA’S ECOSYSTEM

At Lazada, we believe in building a long-term ecosystem that supports local communities and livelihoods that have come to depend on digital commerce as a main source of income. We create opportunities that drive economic growth and empowerment by connecting about 160 million active users to more than one million active selling sellers every month.

# Supporting Muslim and Halal communities

Recognizing the importance for products and food to be reflective of the local communities, we launched a new Halal channel designed to support Muslim and Halal businesses and shoppers in Singapore and Malaysia.

During this reporting period, Lazada Singapore introduced a Halal store in RedMart, while Lazada Malaysia launched a dedicated store, LazHalal, ahead of the Ramadan festival. The timely introduction of Halal categories ensures that consumers have convenient access to a wide range of local and international products that are either Halal-certified or supplied by Muslim-owned sellers. This initiative enhances the overall shopping experience for our Muslim users and underscores our commitment to meeting the diverse needs of the local communities we serve. A similar channel, Lazada Amanah, was launched in 2021 in Indonesia, home to the largest Muslim population in the world.

# Enabling a Seamless Shopping Experience

Our long-term business growth hinges on understanding and catering to consumers’ omnichannel shopping behavior. In the wake of pandemic-induced lockdowns, the lines between online and offline shopping have blurred as consumers seek a seamless integration of both experiences, while brands and sellers look for opportunities to strengthen their online and offline integration. We recognize these evolving needs and actively support our ecosystem in seizing opportunities through omnichannel avenues to facilitate long-term economic growth and success.

# Omnichannel Tech Show

Lazada Singapore launched its inaugural omnichannel tech show, the Grand Online Tech Show, in May 2022. This groundbreaking occasion showcased the seamless integration of online and on-site activities, delivering an engaging shopping journey for tech enthusiasts and our valued brands and sellers. The tech show allowed customers to explore and test products in person while also enjoying the conveniences of online shopping. Consumers could easily make purchases through the Lazada App, with the option of doorstep delivery or in-store pick-ups.

# Catering to Diverse and Evolving Needs

Amidst the growing integration of digital commerce in our everyday lives, we recognize the diverse and evolving needs of different user groups as online shopping behaviors mature. We introduced various channels designed to cater to the specific interests of our diverse groups of buyers and sellers. From inspirational livestream content on LazLive to fitness-focused Lazada Run, beauty-centric LazBeauty, fashion-forward LazLook and inclusivity-driven LazHalal, we have curated distinct experiences for various communities. Additionally, our LazAffliate program allows tech-savvy social media consumers to promote products they love and earn commissions in return.

Through livestreams focused on different passion points, LazLive helps users discover and build new interests.|Lazada Run is the first ever multi-country running event organized by a digital commerce platform in Southeast Asia.

More than 20 international and homegrown tech brands were featured on-site at the Lazada Grand Online Tech Show 2022, and seen more than 25% growth in sales compared with 2021’s all-virtual event.

# National Day Heartland Celebration

As the official digital commerce partner for Singapore’s National Day Heartland Celebrations 2022 @ North East, we hosted “Food Street by Lazada,” an omnichannel event where Lazada partnered with 25 brand merchants to provide local food delights to more than 30,000 residents. Residents could conveniently buy digital vouchers from any brand merchant present at the event through our geolocation discovery feature, “Deals Nearby,” and redeem them during their future visits.

25 brand merchants provided digital vouchers for purchase to residents at the event themed ‘Reminisce our SG culture: Food Street by Lazada’

# Driving Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth

This collaboration also acknowledges our commitment to building a robust digital commerce ecosystem within the region. One of the key growth drivers identified is micro, small and medium enterprises, where digitalization is crucial to improving the operational flexibility and long-term growth of businesses. To enable this development, we made significant investments in building a best-in-class logistics network infrastructure that revolutionized the digital commerce landscape in Southeast Asia. The forum’s aim of “Openness, Connectivity, and Balance” resonated with Lazada’s vision to accelerate the inclusive and sustainable growth of the digital economy in Southeast Asia through digital commerce and technology.

This infrastructure comprises data-driven, technology-driven warehouses, sorting centers and shipping hubs, as well as an extended network of third-party logistics partners, distinguishing us as the sole digital commerce platform in the region with an end-to-end proprietary logistics network.

“Lazada [is] committed to [working] closely with governments and enterprises in the six major markets in Southeast Asia to achieve long-term growth by building a high-quality digital ecosystem. This is also the core of Lazada’s continuous investment in technology, payment and create value for local sellers and consumers.”

# Digitalization among our Sellers Community

Lazada Thailand has made great strides to support the digitalization of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Partnering with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Thailand Tourism Authority and Tourism Council of Thailand, we supported more than 200 local MSMEs with expertise to thrive in the digital economy. As part of our partnership, we offered more than 400 digital vouchers for accommodation and activities through our digital goods category to revive the tourism sector. These partnerships helped promote Thailand’s local tourism agenda and strengthen the country’s digital economy.

Similarly, Lazada Indonesia rolled out the Akselerasi Karya Rakyat (AKAR) Digital Indonesia initiative in partnership with various ministries to support the digital transformation of MSMEs in Indonesia. AKAR initiative provided resources to MSMEs in the Java region to improve digital commerce literacy and increase their competitiveness through skill-based training and mentorships. Since its launch, the AKAR initiative has successfully trained more than 2,000 MSMEs across Java, serving as a catalyst for Indonesia’s digital economy.

# Nurturing a Vibrant Seller Community

We strive to support our sellers and brand partners while promoting a thriving and welcoming seller community. We organized regular Seller Conferences to share the latest campaign updates, trends and insights with our sellers and brand partners. More importantly, our Seller Conferences provide a way for us to celebrate with our sellers and brand partners who have shown remarkable results in their digital commerce businesses.

To facilitate interaction and learning opportunities among sellers, we created Lazada’s Seller Community forum, a vibrant hub for sharing insights and connecting with like-minded individuals. In all the markets we operate, sellers can join the local channels to seek guidance, gather valuable information and stay updated. The forum seamlessly integrates with other essential resources, such as Lazada University and Help Center, to enrich the overall seller experience.

Additionally, we have a Buddy Mentorship Program to foster a strong support network among sellers. In this 4-week voluntary program, new sellers are matched with experienced mentors for learning opportunities and guidance on various digital commerce challenges. The program serves as a valuable peer-to-peer mentoring resource, enhancing seller support and success on our platform.

# Hear from Our Sellers

More than 30 Seller Conferences organized regionally.

More than 1,000 selected sellers received support through the Buddy Mentorship Program, with the help of more than 200 voluntary mentors across Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.

# LIVES AND COMMUNITIES

Beyond the boundaries of the Lazada ecosystem, we extend our positive impact by empowering individuals and fostering positive change in our local communities. We believe we can contribute to a more cohesive and thriving society by encouraging active participation and reducing barriers to digital inclusion.

# Nurturing and Empowering Female Entrepreneurs

As we nurture a vibrant and supportive seller community, we also look to empower our women sellers on the Lazada platform. While the digital commerce industry holds tremendous potential for women across Asia, certain barriers still impede their full participation. We partnered with various organizations to develop tailored support programs and initiatives to equip women with the essential tools and knowledge to excel in digital commerce.

# LazEmpower in Malaysia

In collaboration with the Malaysian Ministry of Women, Family & Community Development, we continuously support women from marginalized and low-income communities with workshops covering diverse topics such as business development and digital communication. These workshops play a crucial role in nurturing participants’ interest in digital commerce by equipping them with essential skill sets and knowledge to embark on digital entrepreneurship. By providing the necessary resources and training, we aim to empower these women to create alternative livelihoods through digital commerce, fostering economic independence and social empowerment.

More than 600 women participated in the workshops since the launch of the program.

# Workshops and knowledge building in universities

In Vietnam and Malaysia, Lazada has taken significant steps to empower youths entering into the digital commerce industry. In Vietnam, Lazada collaborates with universities like Hue College of Economics and the Da Nang University of Economics, to offer official training courses on digital commerce. Upon completion, students receive certifications from Lazada. Similarly in Malaysia, Lazada collaborated with Universiti Teknologi MARA to launch Lazada4Youth, a program focused on digital entrepreneurship and innovation. Lazada4Youth offers workshops that stimulate stronger digital entrepreneurship capabilities among young entrepreneurs, equipping them with essential skills to kickstart and grow their businesses online.

More than 900 total students in attendance across both programs.

# Encouraging Community Participation

At Lazada, we recognize the importance of supporting the adoption of digital payment services. We have formed partnerships and collaborations with regional eWallet and financial institution partners, facilitating a seamless and trusted digital shopping experience for consumers on these services.

Cash transactions for digital commerce purchases remain widely preferred in Southeast Asia. For involved parties, they pose challenges such as inconvenience, longer transaction time and risks of loss or theft, leading to more failed deliveries for consumers. Digital payments have emerged as a safer and more convenient alternative in this context. Although the digital payment penetration rate is growing, many Southeast Asian consumers still lack access to digital payment services due to limited infrastructure and low levels of financial inclusion. We believe digital inclusivity is essential for providing equal opportunities and ensuring that everyone can fully benefit from the advantages of the digital world.

# COMMUNITY RESILIENCE

We believe that building a compassionate and resilient society starts with the local communities we operate in. We deeply appreciate the people and cultures in these communities, and we are committed to giving back and offering support in times of need.

# Active Participation from Youths

Aside from reducing barriers to digital payments, we also seek to encourage active participation from youths in the digital commerce industry. Recognizing the growing importance of digital commerce in the modern business landscape, we have undertaken initiatives to prepare young individuals for the opportunities and challenges it presents.

More than 8% growth in digital payment adoption among monthly buyers on Lazada across the six markets.

To achieve this, we collaborate with universities to integrate relevant digital commerce content into the curricula and organize insightful training workshops, ensuring that students receive up-to-date knowledge and hands-on learning experiences.

# TALENT ATTRACTION

A diverse workforce brings different perspectives, leading to innovative solutions. Additionally, a diverse workforce is more adaptable to change, which is an important skill in today’s rapidly changing world.

At Lazada, we strive to create a positive and inclusive working culture that attracts and retains top talent. We believe that everyone has something to offer, and we wish to create an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.

# Promoting Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Non-discrimination

We recognize the pressing challenge of low women representation in the technology industry, as their participation in the workforce remains notably lower than in other sectors, with only 32% of the technology sector’s workforce in Southeast Asia. We are taking measures to tackle this challenge. In Lazada, women constitute 44% of our total workforce, and we have witnessed an increase in the proportion of female employees over the past two years.

Our talent attraction strategy is designed to promote inclusivity and equal opportunities. We ensure that our job postings, recruitment channels, interview process and communication materials are devoid of discriminatory language and biases. We aim to strike a balance between “must-have” and “good to have” requirements, eliminating biases that may hinder diverse talent from applying. All candidates, regardless of their background, have equal chances to apply and be considered for open positions.

These principles of inclusivity and equal opportunities are exemplified in our local hiring efforts. Focusing on nurturing talent within the regions we operate, we aim to grow the local talent team across the organization. Simultaneously, we embrace the rich diversity of Lazadians hailing from 32 nationalities, celebrating the unique perspectives and experiences our employees from various cultural backgrounds bring to the table.

# TALENT DEVELOPMENT

# Growing through Experience

We believe that employees are our greatest asset. We invest in people development so that our staff can reach their full potential amidst the evolving business landscape and contribute to the company’s sustainable and responsible growth.

The first pillar of our employee development approach revolves around experiential learning. This entails providing our employees with valuable on-the-job experiences and engaging them in assignments carefully designed to challenge and enhance their skills effectively.

# LazSwitch

Acknowledging the vital link between employee motivation, productivity and retention, we aim to create roles that align seamlessly with their interests. We launched LazSwitch, an internal transfer program that provides employees the opportunity to expand their exposure and experience across the company. Lazadians can access the LazSwitch portal to explore available job openings, express interest and learn more about the internal transfer process. Through this initiative, Lazadians are empowered to take an active role in their own career development and progression.

The programs offer employees access to take charge of their own personal development. The selection and design of these programs are guided by a training needs analysis to ensure alignment with business needs.

# EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING

At Lazada, we believe that employee well-being is essential for a productive and motivated workforce. We offer a comprehensive range of programs and benefits designed to support the physical, mental and emotional well-being of our employees.

# Caring for Physical and Mental Well-being

# Employee Benefits

Our comprehensive employee benefits encompass a variety of offerings. To maintain their relevance and competitiveness, we conduct regular reviews and benchmark analyses for these benefit programs against market standards, while user feedback is collected to gauge their effectiveness, usage and claim ratios, health screenings, leaves and self-funded benefits. These evaluations enable us to optimize our benefit offerings and adapt to the evolving needs of Lazadians, ensuring a supportive and rewarding work environment.

# Managing Occupational Health and Safety

# Emergency Response Preparedness (ERP) in Indonesia

Since 2016, we implemented a Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Management System specifically tailored for our logistics operations. This system encompasses all aspects of digital commerce logistics activities, facilities and personnel across the Southeast Asia region. To ensure its effective implementation, we have a series of internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

One key SOP is the Regional Risk Management SOP, which guides identifying and assessing work-related hazards. A dedicated team of certified occupational health and safety personnel conduct this process and apply control measures to eliminate or minimize risks. The information from risk assessments for warehouse and supply chain processes is then uploaded to an internal portal, ensuring accessibility for all employees.

We have also established an SOP for regional HSE incident reporting and investigation to ensure thorough investigations of workplace incidents. This includes hazard identification, risk assessment, determination of corrective actions and improvements to the HSE management system.

Environmental impacts are inherently interconnected with the well-being of our planet and humanity. At Lazada, we firmly believe we have a shared responsibility to protect the environment and promote positive ecological practices. We recognize the impact that our business has on the environment, particularly from increased transport-related emissions and waste generated from packaging materials.

Acknowledging these concerns, Lazada strives to minimize the environment footprint of our activities, by enhancing delivery efficiency and reducing packaging materials usage where possible. We also expanded our collaborations with like-minded partners and leveraged our platform’s reach to advocate for responsible practices among our stakeholders. By taking these steps, we can contribute to creating a more sustainable future for ourselves and our planet.

# CARBON FOOTPRINT

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. In Southeast Asia, the effects are increasingly evident, with rising sea levels leading to more frequent and devastating floods, and soaring temperatures impacting our daily lives. These effects will worsen if no action is taken, posing severe threats to the region’s ecosystems, economies and communities.

As a responsible digital commerce platform, Lazada believes that it is our responsibility to do our part to mitigate climate change and protect the environment. We have been continuously updating our methodologies to reflect on-the-ground conditions and tracking our progress in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result of our efforts, our overall GHG emissions was reduced by 10% compared to the last reporting period.

|Proportion of GHG Emissions in FY2023 (%)|Changes in GHG Emissions in FY2023 Compared to FY2022 (%)|
|---|---|
|53%|5%|
|44%|-15%|

# Taking steps into Clean Energy

Despite the challenges of limited infrastructure for electric vehicles, fluctuating availability of renewable energy, and high initial setup costs, we remain resolute in our commitment to drive positive change. Our initiatives represent the initial steps toward promoting clean energy, setting the stage for greater advancements as we embrace a holistic approach to sustainability and overcome obstacles.

# Adopting electric vehicles in Vietnam

Lazada partnered with Selex Motors, a startup that develops electric vehicles, and purchased 100 electric delivery motorbikes in Vietnam. The electric delivery motorbikes utilize a battery swap solution that allows users to swap depleted batteries for fully charged ones in less than two minutes through a network of battery exchange stations. Electric delivery motorbikes are fitted with larger transportation capacity and can achieve lower environmental and operational costs than gasoline motorbikes. This partnership contributes to Lazada’s goal of managing our impact on the environment, where we have piloted our own fleet of electric bicycles in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City since 2017.

# Developing green logistics operations

We aspire to adopt eco-friendly practices within our logistics operations. To achieve this, Lazada Indonesia introduced solar panels to two logistics facilities in Bali and Bandung, which can generate up to 15% of the total electricity consumed. Other initiatives include facility enhancements such as automated LED lighting control, usage of smart routing technology and eco-friendly packaging solutions.

Our collective efforts have been recognized as Lazada Logistics Indonesia emerged as the inaugural winner of the prestigious B20 Sustainability 4.0 Award in the Responsible Consumption and Production (Plastic) category during this reporting period. This esteemed accolade, initiated by the Swiss Chamber of Commerce in collaboration with other partner organizations, acknowledges private-sector businesses that support sustainable development in Indonesia.

The success of this solar-powered facility concept and other initiatives have paved the way for the adoption of eco-friendly practices in other logistics facilities across Indonesia. This is a testament to our continuous efforts to set a positive example for the industry.

# Enabling Sustainable Consumption

At Lazada, our commitment to managing our carbon footprint goes beyond clean energy adoption. We promote sustainable consumption by optimizing efficiency and implementing energy-saving measures. Furthermore, we inspire and encourage our customers and partners to join us in embracing sustainability practices.

# Fostering Sustainable Lifestyle

We strive to empower our customers with options that promote sustainable practices in their daily lives. Through our grocery arm, RedMart, we promote sustainable grocery shopping by offering various products with reduced environmental impacts.

# Green Logistics

Logistics is the backbone of our business, enabling the seamless movement of millions of parcels. Our logistics services cover pick-up, storage and packing to delivery, with more than 85% of the parcels picked up handled at our facilities. While our logistics operations play a crucial role in our operations, land transport remains a significant contributor to our carbon emissions. To address this, we adopted sustainable initiatives like Priority Delivery which helps to consolidate prioritized orders to optimize delivery routing for maximum efficiency. Additionally, our Multi-Channel Logistics consolidates orders from Lazada’s brand partners, regardless of the digital commerce platforms they operate on. By centralizing deliveries through Lazada, we reduce carbon emissions that would otherwise be generated by separate deliveries from each digital commerce platform.

# Transport Access Point (TAP) Program

In Indonesia, our logistics team introduced an initiative to reduce the trips taken for parcel transfer. Known as the Transport Access Point (TAP) program, we work with our logistics partners to use Lazada’s trucks to deliver their parcels to destination cities when possible, eliminating the need for separate trucks. The TAP program is currently implemented in Sumatra and West Java. The TAP program enhances service and efficiency, helps our third-party logistic partners avoid repeated trips, reduces carbon emissions associated with transportation and demonstrates the positive impact generated from strong partnerships.

# Locally sourced products

RedMart offers locally sourced items with a lower carbon footprint due to reduced transportation distances and sustainably caught seafood, prioritizing biodiversity and the long-term sustainability of fish stocks.

# Plant-based protein alternatives

We provide a variety of plant-based meats that produce less greenhouse gas emissions and require less land compared to traditional meat products.

# Climate-conscious purchasing process

We employ reusable insulation in delivery totes and encourage the collection of carton boxes for reuse or recycling, reducing the usage of single-use packaging and the amount entering landfills.

|More than|20,000 trips avoided through our collaboration with logistics partners in the TAP program in Indonesia|

# Optimal Energy Efficiency

Optimal and efficient energy usage is key to responsibly managing our energy consumption and carbon footprint. In Singapore, we implemented energy-saving measures at our RedMart facility, such as an automated system for lights and air conditioning, which switches off when the office is vacant. We also conducted multiple energy optimization studies and trials, with a particular focus on optimizing the operation of our cooling towers. In our dry warehouse, we enhanced energy efficiency by replacing air handling units with industrial wall fans and high-volume low-speed ceiling fans. The switch led to a reduction in energy consumed without compromising our employees’ comfort. Collectively, these energy-saving initiatives contributed to a more energy-efficient facility.

# MATERIALS AND PACKAGING

Sustainable materials are designed to minimize negative environmental impacts, making them a better choice for the planet. As a multinational company, Lazada shares the responsibility to take action against environmental degradation by adopting sustainable materials and packaging. We have taken tangible steps toward sustainable packaging, centering our initiatives on three key pillars: offering product options with eco-friendly materials, reducing and repurposing material, and collaborating for collective impact.

# Offering Sustainable Product Options

The choice of materials used in our products significantly influences our environmental footprint. Recognizing the potential environmental benefits of having sustainable materials, we have introduced eco-friendly products that empower customers to make sustainable choices.

# Minimizing Packaging Waste

Alongside our eco-friendly product offerings, we strive to reduce, repurpose and explore innovative solutions to minimize waste and reduce plastic usage in our operations.

# Repurpose and resale initiatives

We have various initiatives to minimize food waste. In the reporting period, RedMart launched a pilot initiative with local brewer CRUST Group to repurpose surplus bread from RedMart into a uniquely crafted beer called RedMart X Crust Lager Beer.

We also actively engage in food resale practices where excess stock from our warehouse is made available to other food services and companies at discounted prices, promoting the efficient use of resources. Additionally, perishable items like fresh produce, meat, seafood and bakery items are donated to charitable organizations, ensuring surplus food reaches those in need.

# More than

# RedMart’s eco range products

RedMart offers a wide range of eco-friendly products, from household essentials like hand soap and dishwashing liquids to fruit and vegetable wash. Notably, we offer eco-friendly paper product options such as bamboo facial tissues and baby wipes that are fully biodegradable and certified by Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This certification ensures the material used in our products originates from responsibly managed and sustainable forests. During this reporting period, we expanded our own eco-packaging range with household cleaning products that use plant-based ingredients packed in bottles made from recycled plastic.

# More than

|250kg|of recycled plastic reused since the launch of RedMart’s eco range household cleaning products in May 2022|
|---|---|
|30kg|of bread repurposed into a uniquely crafted beer as part of RedMart’s pilot initiative|

# Enhancing SOPs to minimize waste

With a wide selection of more than 80,000 items, RedMart manages its large inventory by selling goods at markdown prices to buyers. These goods are typically packed in carton boxes for collection.

To enhance this process, RedMart identified a solution that reduces the usage of carton boxes where possible. Recognizing a consistent demand from one regular buyer, RedMart introduced a new SOP that stores orders in the buyer’s tote boxes. Once the collection is completed, the buyer will return the totes to RedMart for the next order. Additionally, using totes eliminates the need for sealing carton boxes with Oriented Polypropylene (OPP) tape, promoting a more sustainable packaging process.

Through close collaboration with like-minded partners, RedMart has reduced its food and packaging waste by creating a closed-loop system that minimizes its environmental footprint.

# Leading the Change in Our Ecosystem

# Collaboration to reduce ocean waste

As a leader within our ecosystem, we implemented initiatives that promote sustainable practices and environmental responsibility. We collaborate with partners to push for innovative solutions and take pride in paving the way for meaningful change.

Southeast Asia generates more than 31 million tons of plastic waste annually8. When such plastic waste leaks into our oceans, it negatively impacts the sustainability of marine habitats and livelihood for communities living in coastal areas and beyond. Indonesia, being the world’s largest archipelagic country, is especially susceptible to these challenges. As part of our commitment to support sustainability practices in the countries we operate in, we supported a competition to find a scalable and sustainable waste management system around the Thousand Islands of Indonesia.

Through our collaborations and joint initiatives, Lazada has pushed forward new solutions to lead meaningful change in our ecosystem. Lazada Vietnam recently launched its Sustainable Packaging Handbook, unveiled during the Digital Economy and Sustainable Development workshop, which serves as a practical guide for digital commerce sellers. It offers insights, best practices and case studies on eco-friendly packaging designs, material selection and waste management. Aligned with Vietnam’s National Strategy on Responding to Climate Change, the handbook was highly appreciated and endorsed by the leaders of the Vietnam E-commerce and Digital Agency, Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development and Vietnam E-commerce Association.

# Collaboration to promote a sustainable supply chain

Lazada collaborated with Eiger Adventure, an outdoor activities products brand, to create a sustainable shopping experience for all customers in Indonesia. Using Lazada’s multi-channel logistics solution, all online orders from Eiger Adventure are fulfilled and delivered by Lazada using sustainable materials, such as Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-certified carton boxes for outer packaging and recycled paper-based honeycomb wraps for inner packaging. The paper-based honeycomb wraps, sourced from discarded cartons to replace plastic air pillows, increase the reuse of paper-based materials and simultaneously minimize the amount of plastic created. With a shared commitment to developing a sustainable supply chain, this collaboration highlights Lazada’s capability to support brands on their sustainability journey.

|More than|1,000kg|of discarded cartons shredded and reused as inner packaging, and more than 100kg of plastic air pillows avoided since the launch of this collaboration in January 2023|

FY2023 ESG Impact Report 28

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Governance is a key component of Lazada’s long-term sustainability and success. It ensures that we operate ethically and responsibly, focusing on delivering value to all stakeholders.

A strong emphasis on ethical behavior and corporate responsibility anchors our governance structure. We have fortified our risk management framework, ensuring its efficacy through well-defined roles, responsibilities and reporting mechanisms. This framework helps us identify, assess and mitigate risks, which can help us protect our assets and reputation.

# Upholding Business Ethics and Anti-corruption

As an ethical and responsible entity, we are committed to conducting business with unwavering ethical principles. Our policies and guidelines govern our approach to business, ensuring that we operate legally, honestly and ethically while complying with national laws and international trade rules. The governance policies cover critical aspects such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, conflict of interest and information security. Every employee is expected to promote a culture of integrity and responsibility within Lazada. Through our concerted efforts, we take pride in achieving a record of zero instances of corruption and bribery.

# Supplier Code of Conduct

We hold our suppliers to high standards, and they are required to acknowledge and adhere to our Suppliers’ Code of Conduct. This code aligns with Lazada’s internal guidelines and policies and outlines the expected behavior of our suppliers. We expect our business partners to share our commitment to conducting business in a legal, fair and ethical manner. Any violation of this code may lead to the termination of contracts.

# Grievance Mechanisms

At Lazada, we maintain a safe and professional work environment through effective communication channels and grievance-handling mechanisms. Our open-door policy encourages line managers to create an atmosphere where employees feel comfortable sharing their input without fear of retaliation. We implemented guidelines to address grievances confidentially and resolve disputes promptly. This approach fosters an environment of trust and mutual respect which serves as a solid foundation for overall success across Lazada. We actively encourage all employees to approach their supervisors or management if they witness any violations of policies or standards, ensuring a supportive and accountable workplace.

Lazada provides a whistleblowing mailbox (whistleblow@lazada.com) and an external whistleblowing channel for reporting any suspected or actual fraud, corruption, illegal acts, or unethical practices by employees and personnel. This platform is available to employees, buyers, sellers and stakeholders. Incidents can be reported in good faith for investigation and appropriate action in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. All grievance information is treated as confidential and is shared only with authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis.

# Implementing Risk Management

Preparing for an uncertain future is crucial, considering risks ranging from climate change, technological disruption, geopolitical instability and global supply chain disruptions. We understand that integrating ESG factors into corporate decision-making is a significant step toward responsible and sustainable risk management. We have implemented Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to ensure a structured and comprehensive approach to better manage risks across our organization. Led by the Group Chief Executive Officer, the ERM Steering Committee has oversight of the company’s most material risks. Supporting the Steering Committee is the ERM Working committee whose primary responsibilities include the development of a robust risk management framework and policy at the group level. They also focus on enhancing risk management processes, identifying major risks and devising effective risk mitigation strategies.

Furthermore, our risk management system operates in synergy with internal and third-party audits, forming a “three lines of defense” mechanism of risk management and control. This multi-layered approach allows us to proactively monitor, assess and respond to risks, ensuring greater protection for our customers and stakeholders.

|1st Line|Business management|

|2nd Line|Risk management|
|3rd Line|Independent audit|
|Management teams at each department or business unit|identify, assess and manage risks as an integral part of their business activities.|
|Various functional teams|provide guidance, oversight and expertise in managing risks across the company.|

# Asian Legal Business Southeast Asia Awards

Lazada achieved a remarkable feat by winning the prestigious Asian Legal Business Southeast Asia Awards during the reporting period. We were honored with the title “Compliance and Risk Management In-House Team of the Year” for two years in a row, acknowledging our exceptional compliance and risk management capabilities. The award recognized our exceptional capabilities in managing privacy incidents and third-party data risks across Southeast Asia, ensuring data security and compliance.

# CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY

Cybersecurity and data privacy are critical to the success of digital commerce. In the ever-changing world of digital commerce, it is essential to protect customer data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This is especially important given the vast amount of data that flows through our online platform.

At Lazada, we implement robust measures to ensure secure transactions and prevent data breaches. We undergo regular comprehensive audits by external assessors to enhance our cybersecurity measures and align with industry standards.

We successfully obtained certification against the ISO 27001:2013 standard in 2019 and have retained it since then, assuring the security of our corporate information assets. This certification distinguishes Lazada as one of the few certified digital commerce platforms in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, Lazada Singapore has achieved the Advocate level of the Cyber Trustmark certification issued by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore. This certification demonstrates Lazada Singapore’s exceptional safety and security standards and its capabilities to effectively identify and mitigate abnormal systems or user behaviors.

# Security Measures

Lazada has implemented a robust vulnerability management process, including routine network vulnerability scans on server infrastructure to identify common application and system-level vulnerabilities. Before launching any application into production, an internal vulnerability scan is automatically conducted using our release management platform.

Moreover, our security measures encompass penetration testing executed by our in-house Red Team and an independent external provider for applications connected to public networks. Any issues identified during these tests are promptly addressed and managed through our internal ticketing platform and vulnerability management processes.

To fortify our cybersecurity defenses and safeguard our users’ trust, we are taking measures to consistently mitigate these risks, including promoting user and employee awareness and implementing robust third-party risk management practices.

# Protecting Privacy

Safeguarding privacy is closely tied to ensuring customer security. Operating in the dynamic digital commerce industry of Southeast Asia, Lazada obtains a wide variety of essential services from third parties across diverse industries to support our operations. To maintain our stringent cybersecurity and data privacy obligations expected by regulatory and contractual requirements, we must thoroughly assess our partners’ security measures before entering into service agreements.

# Third-party Risk Management

We implemented a robust Third-party Risk Management program to assess the security maturity and capabilities of third-party service providers and safeguard the interests of buyers and sellers. Under this program, all third-party service providers are automatically included, and risk profiling is carried out to identify and prioritize potential risks. Collaborative risk assessments and management processes are conducted with third parties. Furthermore, we have seamlessly integrated the Third-party Due Diligence process into our regular operational onboarding procedures, ensuring sustainability and scalability as our business grows.

# Employees Awareness Improvement

To foster a culture of cybersecurity and data privacy responsibility, we have implemented Project Sparta, an internal awareness program. This program encompasses various initiatives aimed at enhancing the cyber-resilience of our employees which include periodic drills, cybersecurity training and awareness campaigns through posters and live streams.

# In-platform Protection

We encourage our platform users to play an active role in fraud prevention. We have established a dedicated channel for users to report suspicious activities, allowing us to take prompt action to protect users from potential losses. Our in-platform protection features include:

- Utilizing advanced data science and technology to efficiently identify and address suspicious sellers and transactions
- Implementing an in-platform secure payment solution for all transactions
- Offering direct feedback channels on the platform, empowering buyers to promptly report suspicious sellers and unauthorized transactions

# Ensuring Customer Security

Safeguarding our customers and their data is our utmost priority. In the dynamic realm of the digital landscape, we recognize both the opportunities and challenges that may arise. We have implemented rigorous security measures to address these, including regular internal audits to identify and address potential lapses. We also collaborate with stakeholders from various departments to ensure regulatory compliance and maintain a culture of security awareness.

As a result, we have achieved no substantiated complaints concerning customer privacy breaches or customer data losses in the reporting period.

# Cybersecurity Partnerships

Lazada stays updated on industry trends and global cybersecurity regulations relevant to our operations. We proactively identify cybersecurity concerns and regularly benchmark our practices against industry peers to maintain high performance. This outward perspective ensures our adherence to data privacy laws and allows us to adapt to the evolving cybersecurity landscape while meeting industry standards.

# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Intellectual property (IP) protection is essential for a legally compliant and healthy digital commerce environment in Southeast Asia. Committed to safeguarding IP Rights (IPR) and product authenticity, we are the first Southeast Asian digital commerce company with a dedicated IPR Protection Team. To further deepen our efforts in IPR protection, we took the lead in forming the Southeast Asia E-Commerce Anti-Counterfeiting Working Group (SeCA) in September 2022.

We released the 2022 Lazada Intellectual Property Rights Annual Report, highlighting our main achievements. In this section, we present a selection of key figures extracted from the report to provide a snapshot of our impact.

# Bug bounty live event with YesWeHack

As part of this collaboration, Lazada partnered with YesWeHack, a leading global Bug Bounty and Vulnerability Disclosure Policy Platform, to host a two-day live bug bounty event. Certain security mechanisms were voluntarily disabled for participating researchers, allowing them to conduct comprehensive testing. This event provided a unique opportunity to thoroughly assess our applications, and the direct interaction with researchers facilitated an exclusive exchange of insights into the vulnerabilities discovered.

Accomplishing this commitment to security and progressive stance demonstrates Lazada’s dedication to strengthening their security, transparency, as well as data privacy and protection. We are delighted to be able to contribute to yet another successful collaboration with Lazada.

# Advancing IPR protection

Recognizing the urgency of collective action, Lazada has formed strategic collaborations with esteemed organizations within the digital space. The collaborations aim to tackle the rapidly evolving challenges of counterfeit trade in online retail and increase knowledge and capabilities among regulators in safeguarding IPR.

In addition to collaborations with industry leaders and government agencies, we continued to strengthen our efforts in intellectual property protection (IPP) through strategic partnerships and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signings with esteemed organizations such as the Intellectual Property Protection Agency, Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) and the Pharmaceutical Security Institute, among others. These collaborations led to impactful workshops and events, including sharing our IPP program with other organizations and government agencies.

Our dedication to safeguarding consumers from counterfeit goods was recognized during the REACT Annual Assembly, further reinforcing our commitment to protect the interests of brands, rights holders and consumers.

# Online scam training for Law Enforcement Agency in Thailand

Lazada Thailand has collaborated with the Thailand Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) since 2021. During the reporting period, we partnered with the International Criminal Police Organization and the Singapore Police Force to conduct training for the CIB on combating online scams, public-private partnerships and scam prevention strategies.

# Southeast Asia eCommerce Anti-Counterfeiting Working Group

Lazada launched the Southeast Asia eCommerce Anti-Counterfeiting Working Group (SeCA Working Group) with our brand partners during IP Week @ SG, organized by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore.

Headquartered in Singapore, the SeCA Working Group pledges to support IPR and consumer protection initiatives within the digital commerce landscape. The Working Group plans to develop an online directory that includes IPR protection policies, programs and resources to create a trusted and safe digital commerce environment.

# Safeguarding Governance through Technology

In addition to collaborative action, we leverage technology to strengthen our safeguarding efforts. Lazada’s IPP Platform is a user-friendly portal for rights holders to submit takedown requests in cases of suspected infringement. Our platform accepts requests pertaining to trademark, copyright, patent rights and registered design rights while offering comprehensive assistance and guidance throughout the takedown process. To ensure continuous improvement, we made updates to enhance the user experience, including refined user notifications, clearer explanations for takedown request rejections and an updated Lazada IPP Guide.

We have also taken proactive measures to swiftly remove counterfeit listings from our platform. By utilizing advanced technology and collaborating with rights holders, we leverage data and product-specific information to detect and identify listings suspected of selling counterfeit goods. To further enhance our capabilities, we are exploring the application of image recognition technology to bolster our detection efforts.

# IPP Platform Performance
