# Annual Report 2021

# Captii Limited

Captii invests in technology and innovation. In 2021 we continued to focus on managing our businesses and venture investments against the challenging backdrop of further COVID-19 lockdowns and continuing trading and movement restrictions. One new investment was made during the year, bringing the number of investees in our venture investment portfolio at year-end to a total of 15 companies from 7 countries. While many investees weathered the impact of the protracted pandemic by finding new sources of business and funding, or were fortunate enough to benefit from the circumstances, some did not fare so well.

Having battled through the second year of the pandemic, our venture investment portfolio constituents and our existing businesses of Unifiedcomms, PostPay and GlobeOSS, had a mixed 2021. Those that benefited from the circumstances and behavioural changes brought about by the pandemic continued to do well. OOPA, a Captii Ventures investee and associate company, achieved a significantly favourable litigation outcome during the year, culminating in the indirect addition of Telio Vietnam into our venture investment portfolio to deliver a significant positive impact on group results. At year-end 2021, our venture investment portfolio was fair-valued at S$28.5 million versus investment cost of S$8.9 million.

# Annual Report 2021

# Executive Chairman’s Letter

Dear Captii Shareholder:

On behalf of the board of directors, I am pleased to present the annual report of Captii Limited for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.

# Another year of contrasts

Our group entered the 2021 financial year on the back of thirteen consecutive years of profit.

Our Unifiedcomms business generated higher revenue this year while our GlobeOSS business unfortunately did not. GlobeOSS posted revenue of S$8.7 million, a decrease of 6.6% from the S$9.3 million achieved in 2020. Unifiedcomms revenue in contrast increased by 25.9% to S$15.2 million in 2021 compared to the S$12.1 million recorded the year before.

As a result of this, group revenue increased from S$21.4 million in 2020 to S$23.9 million in 2021, an improvement of S$2.5 million.

Gross profit achieved by our group was higher this year, as a result of improved revenue. However the magnitude of the increase was lesser than that of revenue – gross profit rose by 3.2%, as compared to the 11.8% increase in revenue. This reflected the considerably lower average gross profit margin for the year of 48.7%, which resulted from the less favourable sales mix of 2021. This year the lower margin managed service contract revenues of Unifiedcomms was mainly due to higher third-party costs on certain managed service contracts.

# Balance sheet strength and dividends

Apart from the one further investment made by Captii Ventures in 2021, during the year we continued to reinvest in GlobeOSS and Unifiedcomms – especially for the PostPay business – for further product development as well as for the acquisition of assets to support the fulfilment of managed service contracts. We continue to have a strong balance sheet at year-end 2021 with ample cash and cash equivalents of S$13.8 million. This was also after declaring and paying to shareholders a dividend for the eleventh year running.

We had on 20 September 2021, paid a tax-exempt interim dividend of 1.25 Singapore Cents per share. In light of the anticipated capital requirements of our group’s growth and investment-driven development strategy, no further and final dividend payment has been recommended by our directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.

Group profit before tax for 2021 came in at S$10.4 million, 109.4% higher compared to the S$4.9 million recorded for 2020. The substantial increase in profit before tax arose from the progress achieved at Captii Ventures which resulted in a substantial increase in the fair value of its venture investment portfolio during the year.

# In gratitude

2021 proved to be another challenging year for our group but one that ended on a firmly positive note. We concluded the year with encouraging financial results, mainly from the progress achieved in our venture investing activities at Captii Ventures.

In terms of the bottom-line, group profit after tax for the year was S$9.5 million, representing a 127.5% improvement on the S$4.2 million recorded last year.

# Our 14th consecutive year of profit with ROE uplift

2021 represented our fourteenth consecutive year of profitability. Profitability in 2021 had improved compared to 2020 – our group’s return on equity (ROE) increased to 19% this year from 7.9% the year before. This improvement in our ROE performance is largely attributable to the non-cash negative goodwill and fair value gain on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio. Without this gain, our group recorded an adjusted ROE of 2.4% in 2021, lower compared to the adjusted ROE of 3.5% generated in 2020.

# Growth in system sale and managed service revenues

Efforts to grow the managed service business persisted in 2021. Revenues from this contract type improved by S$1.1 million against last year with the increase being attributable to the higher managed service contract revenues from Unifiedcomms.

Group system sale contract revenue was higher for 2021, with system sale contract performance at both Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS showing improvement. System sale revenue at GlobeOSS increased by 29% to S$5.5 million in 2021 compared to S$4.3 million recorded in 2020. Unifiedcomms system sale revenue meanwhile improved by 15.3% to S$1.5 million in 2021, as compared to S$1.3 million recorded for 2020.

# Annual Report 2021

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# An overview of our business

Our group comprises three main segments: Unifiedcomms, GlobeOSS and Captii Ventures.

# Revenue by BU (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|Unifiedcomms|12,069|15,196|
|GlobeOSS|9,292|8,675|

Throughout 2021, Unifiedcomms continued to address mobile network operators and integrated telecoms service providers with application and platform software, turnkey solutions and systems and a variety of professional and managed services. In 2016 a unit within Unifiedcomms called PostPay (formerly Mobilization) was revitalised into a fresh start-up and given prominence as part of a wider reorganisation of the Unifiedcomms business. PostPay focuses mainly on providing advanced solutions for prepaid credit on a managed service model.

GlobeOSS meanwhile, has developed into Malaysia’s leading systems integration and solution provider in the telecoms big data and analytics field.

Unifiedcomms operates primarily in the telecoms-tech markets of three regions: South East Asia (SEA), South Asia (SA) and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) while GlobeOSS focuses exclusively on SEA. For Unifiedcomms, with the exception of Malaysia, Singapore and Pakistan, where engagement with the customer is conducted directly by our own personnel, the majority of our engagements with customers are carried out through various sales channel partners. This two-tier sales and distribution approach enables us to cost-effectively reach customers within each region of focus and to tap into the local knowledge and insights of our partners to build and deliver compelling solutions.

Captii Ventures, the venture investment arm of our group, focuses primarily on the SEA market for start-up investment opportunities. Our venture investment business regularly interacts with other venture capital (VC) management companies in the region and participates in funding rounds as either lead investor or as a co-investor following the lead investor. In 2021 Captii Ventures added one new investee to its portfolio of start-up investments while also supporting existing investees in realising the development plans for their business.

As at end-2021, there are a total of 173 people that are employed in our group. The majority of these personnel are located in Malaysia, where our operational headquarters is situated, while the rest work out of Singapore, Pakistan, Brunei, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.

# Unifiedcomms Revenue by Type of Contract (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|System Sales|1,269|1,463|
|Managed Services|10,800|13,733|

The Unifiedcomms customer base has traditionally been concentrated in the SEA region. This has not changed in 2021, with Unifiedcomms SEA region revenues accounting for 96.8% of the total revenue achieved for the year.

# Unifiedcomms Revenue by Geographical Regions (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|SEA|11,182|14,704|
|SA|333|273|
|MEA|554|219|
|Others| | |

The GlobeOSS business experienced a decline in managed service contract revenues in 2021. Managed service contract revenues decreased to S$3.1 million in 2021 from S$5 million achieved for 2020. GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues however increased by 28.9%, from S$4.3 million in 2020 to S$5.5 million in 2021.

# GlobeOSS Revenue by Type of Contract (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|System Sales|4,297|5,537|
|Managed Services|4,995|3,138|

# Annual Report 2021

# Management Discussion and Analysis

GlobeOSS continues to have both its system sale and managed service business concentrated in the SEA region. The decrease in GlobeOSS revenue from the SEA region reflects the S$1.9 million decrease in managed service contract revenues between 2020 and 2021, that had more than offset the improvement in system sales contract revenues.

# GlobeOSS Revenue by Geographical Regions (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|SEA|9,288|8,675|
|SA| | |
|MEA| | |
|Others| | |

# Growth in both system sale and managed service revenues

The increase in group revenue this year against last year was mainly attributable to the 27.2% or S$2.9 million increase in Unifiedcomms managed service contract revenues and the 28.9% or S$1.2 million increase in GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues.

# Revenue by Type of Contract (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|System Sales|5,566|7,000|
|Managed Services|15,795|16,871|

# Gross Profit by Type of Contract (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|System Sales|3,304|4,161|
|Managed Services|7,964|7,469|

# Gross Profit Margin by Type of Contract (%)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|System Sales|59.4%|59.4%|
|Managed Services|50.4%|44.3%|

We expected 2021 to be a difficult year for Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS on the system sale front. However contrary to earlier expectations, market conditions improved in the second half of the year, especially for GlobeOSS. Coupled with improved success rates for sales opportunities, significant growth in GlobeOSS system sale contract revenue was delivered in the second half of the year.

SEA once again served as the principal driver for the improvement in group revenue for the year, growing by 14.2% or S$2.9 million against last year’s contribution. The region that turned in a disappointing performance was MEA, which had its contribution fall from S$0.6 million to S$0.2 million. The SA region’s contribution to the total group revenue was maintained at S$0.3 million this year.

# Revenue by Geographical Regions (S$’000)

| |2020|2021|
|---|---|---|
|SEA|20,470|23,379|
|SA|333|554|
|MEA|273|219|
|Others| | |

In 2021, SEA, our group’s home region, continues to be the largest geographic source of revenue, accounting for 97.9% of group revenue.

# Annual Report 2021

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# Operating Expenditure (S$’000)

| |2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Operating Expenditure|9,524|9,388|9,369|8,733|8,381|

When the bottom line numbers are examined more closely, to exclude exceptional gains such as the fair value gain and negative goodwill enjoyed on the acquisition of OOPA, and gains or losses such as those to do with fair value movements of the other Captii Ventures portfolio investments, the profit performance of Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS is made more apparent. The ‘adjusted’ net profit generated by Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS businesses have declined from S$2.5 million in 2017 to S$1.5 million in 2021.

# Net Profit before Fair Value Effect (S$’000) & Net Profit Margin before Fair Value Effect (%)

| |2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Net Profit|2,456|2,191|2,431|2,296|1,458|

Even after excluding the effect of exceptional items such as the fair value loss on our investment property, our opex for 2021 was higher at S$9.4 million compared to S$8.3 million in 2020. This increase was due to higher payroll cost coupled with lower COVID-19 related government subsidy allowances received in 2021.

# Operating Expenditure before Exceptional Items (S$’000)

| |2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Operating Expenditure|9,383|9,148|8,517|8,374|8,333|

In terms of bottom line, our group recorded a net profit margin of 39.8% for 2021 versus 19.6% for 2020. If the effect of any fair value gain or loss is removed, our group net profit margin for 2021 decreased to 6.1% from the 10.7% achieved in 2020. The flow-down effect of the changes in group net profit before and after exceptional items and fair value movements is clearly reflected in our EBITDA results for the year.

# EBITDA (S$’000)

| |2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|EBITDA|11,487|5,981|4,615|4,663|3,712|

2021 marks our fourteenth consecutive year of being in the black. Group net profit for the year, at S$9.5 million, is 127.5% higher than the S$4.2 million recorded in 2020. This substantial increase in our group’s bottom line was largely attributable to a fair value gain on the remeasurement of the group’s previously held interest in OOPA Pte Ltd (‘OOPA’), and a negative goodwill arising on the step-up interest on the acquisition of OOPA. These exceptional gains amounting to S$6.1 million resulted in a significant increase in the fair value of our group’s venture investment portfolio under Captii Ventures, but had no cash impact on our business.

# Profit for the Year (S$’000) & Net Profit Margin (%)

| |2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Net Profit Margin|39.8%|19.6%|9.3%|10.8%|12.0%|

EBITDA improved to S$11.5 million in 2021, an increase of 92.1% in tandem with the 127.5% increase in net profit. A significant proportion of this EBITDA improvement is accounted for by the impact on group net profit of the fair value gain and negative goodwill enjoyed on the acquisition of OOPA. Removing the effect of non-cash items in 2021, the cash generation performance at our underlying business can be identified. EBITDA before exceptional items and fair value gain stood at S$3.6 million for 2021 – a decrease of 13.8% against what was achieved in 2020.

# Annual Report 2021

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# EBITDA before Exceptional Items & Fair Value Effect (S$’000)

|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|4,071|4,598|4,448|4,145|3,575|

Because of the higher net profit delivered in 2021, our group’s return on equity (ROE) for the year improved sharply to 19% from the 7.9% recorded in 2020. This double-digit outcome for 2021 was certainly a welcome result after several years of disappointing returns. Of course this positive outcome was aided by the outsized contribution from the fair value gain and negative goodwill on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio. Without the benefit of these gains our group would have had a much lower ROE for 2021.

Now to turn to our group’s balance sheet as at the end of the 2021 financial year: we ended 2021 with higher current assets of S$27.2 million, as compared to S$25.3 million as at end-2020. This was mainly attributable to the increase in trade and other receivables from S$9.7 million to S$11.4 million as a result of higher revenue achieved by our group in respect of major system sale contracts that were awarded to and billed by the GlobeOSS business late in 2021. After the repayment of borrowings, group cash and cash equivalents as at end-2021 was S$13.8 million as compared to S$13.1 million as at end-2020.

# Cash and Cash Equivalents (S$’000)

|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|10,173|8,686|7,391|13,147|13,823|

# Shareholders Equity (S$’000) & Return on Equity (%)

|2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|37,055|39,026|40,754|43,783|51,972|

Our total non-current assets increased from S$30.7 million as at 31 December 2020 to S$44.1 million as at 31 December 2021, representing an increase of 43.6%. This was mainly due to increase in other financial assets as a result of the significant increase in the fair value and negative goodwill relating to acquisition of OOPA being reflected in the Captii Ventures investment portfolio.

This year the contribution of system sale contracts was considerably higher, arising from growth in revenue performance of both Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS. Managed service contracts showed steady revenue growth at Unifiedcomms. With the performance of our businesses being maintained if not improved further in 2022, we are optimistic of our being able to also further extend our dividend payout track record – to at minimum, maintain the dividend per share that was paid to all shareholders last year.

Investing in (external) technology and innovation As at end-2021, we continued to have more than sufficient capital to augment our organic growth plans with growth by strategic investment. This remains an essential element of our current business plan that targets sustained, double-digit group profit growth and a significant uplift of our ROE performance. Throughout 2021, Captii Ventures persisted in identifying and evaluating many investment opportunities in the SEA region. As a direct result of these efforts by Venture Investment team, we have a total of fifteen investments in technology ventures and start-ups as at end-2021. Out of these fifteen investments, one was made during the year while an existing investment in OOPA which was subject to litigation proceedings throughout 2020 and 2021, secured good progress following a favourable judgement being awarded by the High Court of Singapore. This resulted in OOPA becoming a subsidiary of our group, and Telio becoming an indirect portfolio investee of significant value for Captii Ventures.

Our group’s net cash generated from operations for 2021 was S$3.7 million, a decrease of 34.4% as compared to the net cash generated from operations of S$5.6 million in the previous year. This decrease is mainly attributable to a less favourable working capital change of S$0.1 million for 2021, as compared to S$1.5 million for 2020. This decline was mainly due to lower collections of trade receivables for 2021 as compared to 2020.

# Annual Report 2021

# Management Discussion and Analysis

Our group’s net cash used in investing activities for 2021 amounted to S$0.4 million, a decrease of 27.2% as compared to the S$0.5 million invested in 2020. The lower net cash used in investing activities this year is attributable to the lower investment in plant and equipment invested for new managed service contracts.

The group’s net cash used in financing activities for 2021 amounted to S$1.6 million, in line against what was recorded in 2020.

# 2021: a positive year overall but disappointing for some

We expected system sale market conditions to continue to be somewhat challenging for our group in 2021 and for our managed service contract portfolio to deliver significant growth. This proved not to be the case this year yet again as GlobeOSS managed to secure an increase in system sale contract revenues but experienced an offsetting decline in managed service contract revenues. Unifiedcomms meanwhile, achieved higher managed service contract revenues, with the outperformance of a new contract more than offsetting the underperformance of certain existing managed service contracts at Unifiedcomms. However, this improvement in revenue performance came at the expense of thinning margins.

Although the growth in system sale business at GlobeOSS in 2021 had significantly augmented the slower than desired growth of our group’s managed service contract portfolio, we do not expect this to be the trend that can readily be extended in the years ahead. Significant uncertainty and lumpiness is still to be expected in the contribution of system sale contracts to our group’s future results. The need for our group to continue to strengthen our managed service contract portfolio and to continue to grow our venture investing business as the basis for delivering steady, if not rapid yet sustainable future growth, remains.

At Captii Ventures, our group’s venture investment business, the climate for business development and funding has improved but continues to be challenging for certain start-ups in industries or business areas that remain significantly affected by COVID-19. As a result of the settlement achieved at OOPA in 2021, a significant fair value gain on our group’s venture investment portfolio has been reflected in the results for the current financial year. A number of other investees continued to grow strongly through the year and contributed to the significant improvement in value of the Captii Ventures investment portfolio.

Against an improving macroeconomic backdrop for the future, the group remains optimistic and will continue to work closely with customers and investees, to minimise the negative impact of COVID-19 on group financial performance. The group continues to take an active and measured approach to managing risks to protect the group’s people and assets, and will sustain these efforts until the pandemic truly resolves.

# Challenges and opportunities in 2021 and beyond

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect many countries in our group’s regions of focus, though certain territories have relaxed movement and travel restrictions.

The impact of COVID-19 on Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS operations in the current financial year has fortunately remained minimal. Contracts in-hand continue to be progressed and management of the group are hopeful that new projects and initiatives requiring our products and services will continue to be pursued by customers. The possibility remains however, that larger system sale contracts that have yet to be committed in the current financial year may be further deferred, or even abandoned entirely if macroeconomic and industry conditions do not improve quickly or significantly enough. Some managed service contracts of the group which have been impacted by government restrictions or directives arising from COVID-19 policy measures may meanwhile continue to show weaker performance.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# STATEMENT ON SUSTAINABILITY

As a subsidiary of Advance Synergy Berhad (‘ASB’), a company listed on Bursa Malaysia, Captii aligns its sustainability strategy with its parent company in three focus areas: Sustaining Growth - Caring for the Environment; Empowering Lives - Caring for our People; and Nurturing Communities - Caring for the Society. We identify with these action areas and they serve as focal points for us.

Captii’s board of directors and management are committed to establish and maintain an effective sustainability management system which is supported by underlying internal controls, risk management practices, clear accountability and reporting process. The board evaluates the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities relevant to the company during the formulation of their overall business strategy, objectives and performance measurements.

Management identifies the type of relevant ESG topics caused by its day-to-day operations. Management then determines the materiality of the ESG factors based on the level of significance of impact and influence on stakeholder values, and the achievement of Captii’s strategic objectives. The board supports and approves the identification and assessment parameters of material ESG factors. The material ESG factors for Captii have been identified and reviewed by Captii’s board and management. The board and management shall continue to dedicate leadership to and maintain a high standard of sustainability governance to drive continuous and long-term growth for all its stakeholders. Captii will continue working towards ensuring comprehensive disclosures on the management and monitoring of our sustainability initiatives for continual improvement.

# STRATEGIC APPROACH FOR SUSTAINABILITY

At Captii, we continue to refine our management approach to adapt to the changing business and sustainability landscape. Aligning with the perspective of our stakeholders, the management has, within the scope of our business operations, identified that the environment, employee relations, health & safety, product excellence, and stakeholder relations constitute key sustainability aspects material to our business.

In this regard, we have established a sustainability performance management framework (See Exhibit 1.), to enhance the monitoring and reporting of our sustainability performance.

# REPORTING PRACTICE AND BOUNDARY

The sustainability report provides detailed disclosure of management of our key sustainability matters for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.

# UNDERSTANDING WHAT MATTERS TO US

We use a comprehensive materiality assessment to identify priority areas based on the business strategy outlined in our plan. Our materiality assessments were based on the AA1000 Account Ability Principles of Inclusivity and Materiality, as well as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Principles for Defining Report Content – stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality and completeness. Materiality with respect to sustainability reporting, as defined by GRI Standards, includes topics and indicators that reflect the organisation’s significant environmental and social impacts, and would substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.

In 2018, a robust process was undertaken to identify and prioritise Captii’s material ESG factors.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

The material ESG factors have been reviewed by Captii’s board and determined as being relevant. Management strives to embrace the UN Global Compact and at present adopts a best-effort approach in observing the spirit and intent of its ten principles. Although its efforts to uphold the ten principles are not presently embedded in its operational policy and procedure documentation, the work culture of Captii’s businesses is consistent with these principles.

In order to keep abreast of critical issues, management reviews annually Captii’s material ESG factors against the changing business environment, stakeholder opinions, and emerging global and local trends.

# SUSTAINING GROWTH

# ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

Environmental sustainability forms an integral part of Captii’s sustainability philosophy. At Captii, we endeavour to integrate the best sustainability practices and compliance across our value chain to reduce adverse environmental impact on the ecosystem. Given that our businesses have operations that are concentrated in offices; the impact on the environment is relatively limited and confined largely to resource and energy efficiency. In our daily operations, we continue to be committed on recycling, energy-saving practices and undertaking measures to reduce wastage, pollution and harmful emissions.

Captii is committed and strive to improve resource efficiency and reduce our environmental impact. We continue to factor in environmental considerations in our businesses.

Captii continues to encourage our staff to be environmentally conscious by promoting paperless administration and operational practices to reduce paper usage and to be constantly mindful of minimising energy and water wastage. This includes office practices such as making double-sided copies when printing and photocopying, whenever possible, using the blank side of used paper for notes before recycling, reusing envelopes for internal mails and documents, switching off lights, IT equipment and other electrical devices during lunch hour or when not in use, and maintaining only security lighting after business hours.

Captii has also promoted the use of more energy efficient ceiling and desktop fans and heat shielding materials in offices to manage workplace ambient temperatures.

# Commitments & Targets

- Continue to explore solutions that minimise environmental impact.
- Maintain energy-efficient equipment and devices at our facilities whenever possible, including LED lights and more energy efficient-cooling solutions.

During the reporting period, there were no incidents of non-compliance and penalties pertaining to environmental-related issues. To maintain the highest standard of environmental compliance and to prevent future occurrence of incidence, management continues to review and improve current environmental management system and practices, and ensure that all our activities and operations comply with existing regulatory requirements.

# Electricity Consumption

In 2021, Captii consumed a total of 172,047 kWh of energy, lower against 294,703 kWh of energy recorded in 2020.

# Waste Management

There was no hazardous waste generated from the business operations for 2021. Non-hazardous waste, from business operations, which includes old and malfunctioned equipment, such as computers, hard disks, etc are disposed through third parties periodically.

# Environmental Compliance

Captii remains committed to comply with all applicable legal requirements enforced by local government authorities and relevant enforcers. Captii’s operations continue to conform to local environmental laws and regulations. All employees of Captii and that of contractors and consultants are encouraged to be proactive and forthcoming in managing and reporting environmental related issues and complaints.

# PRODUCT EXCELLENCE

We believe that our financial viability hinges on customer satisfaction and our ability to meet customer demand for our product and services. Captii remains committed to execution excellence and building enduring relationships with not only our customers, but key stakeholders in our value chain.

- Internal quality control and timely respond to our customers.
- 24-hour customer careline for customers to lodge feedbacks on service issue.
- Feedback from customers including complaints are documented for future improvement and development of products and services.

# Commitments & Targets

- Continue to achieve product excellence through innovation and technology.
- Continue to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction across our businesses.

# SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

The audit committee supports the board in its oversight of regulatory compliance and is responsible for driving Captii’s focus on implementing effective compliance and governance systems. At an operational level, the respective business segments and department within business segments are responsible to identify and self-assess the adequacy and effectiveness of mitigating measures, and manage their financial, operational, compliance and reputational related risks.

As part of our commitment to ethical business practices, Captii adopts a “zero-tolerance approach” towards any form of bribery and corruption in conducting its business. The Captii’s Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy (“ABAC Policy”) applies to all Captii’s officers, directors, employees, contractors, its subsidiaries and joint venture companies under Captii’s control. Third parties acting on behalf of or in the name of Captii, including agents, representatives, outsource providers, suppliers and other intermediaries, are required to act consistently with Captii’s ABAC Policy.

Captii has put in place a whistleblowing policy and procedure to provide an avenue and platform for all personnel, employees, agents and/or third parties to disclose any acts of bribery and/or corruption in a confidential manner that protects the whistleblower from any risk of reprisal. See Corporate Governance, page 19 and 26.

Captii continues to support local business by procuring supplies from them and contracting services locally. We believe that a strong local supply chain through productive partnership is vital to the growth of our business. By such support, we believe that we can positively contribute to the local economy. We select partners who share our work ethics and values and who are willing to provide high quality products and services in a responsible manner.

In cases where local suppliers are not suitable, we will source internationally. Where outsourcing is practised, we will ensure that the products conform to our sustainable policies and are labelled with “good manufacturing practices”. We believe Captii’s long-term business is built mainly on the trust and confidence of customers. Therefore, feedback from customers are measured by customer satisfaction assessments, and customer complaints are documented for future improvement and development of products and services.

# REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Given the geographical diversity of our businesses, we closely monitor developments in the laws and regulations of countries where Captii operates to ensure that our businesses and operations comply with all relevant laws and regulations.

All our key employees affirm their understanding of the code of business conduct annually. We regularly engage with local government authorities and agencies to keep abreast of changes to laws and regulations.

We recognise that non-compliance with laws and regulations not only has significant financial impact but potentially detrimental reputational impact on Captii.

# Commitments & Targets

- We are fully committed to strengthening our regulatory compliance framework. Our emphasis is clear and consistently reiterated. We have zero tolerance for fraud, bribery, corruption and violation of laws and regulations.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The board is supported by various committees, namely the AC, NC and RC whose functions are also described below. In addition, the board consists of directors with ages ranging from the fourties to seventies, who have served on the board for different tenures. The board members with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the group’s business and direction.

The criterion for independence is based on the provisions stated in the Code. The board considers an “independent” director as one who has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, its 5% shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgement with a view to the best interests of the company.

In addition, pursuant to Rule 210(5)(d) of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST, directors cannot be regarded as independent if:

1. A director who is or has been employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three (3) financial years; and
2. A director has an immediate family member who is, or has been in any of the past three (3) financial years, employed by the company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee.

The independence of the independent director is subject to the NC’s annual review, based on the provisions stated in the Code, in particular the rigorous review on the continued independence of independent directors who have served for more than nine (9) years from the date of their first appointment.

In respect of each of the two (2) independent directors, namely Peng Hock and Paul having served more than nine (9) years, the board has considered specifically their length of service and their continued independence. The board determined that the independent directors remained independent in character and judgment, and that there were no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director’s judgment. The board is of the opinion that their length of service has not, in any way, affected their independence.

In reviewing board composition and succession planning, the NC takes into account its diversity aspirations for the board and considers the benefits of all aspects of diversity, including diversity of background, experience, gender, age and other relevant factors. These differences are considered in determining the optimum composition of the board and when possible, should be balanced appropriately. The NC reviews the policy from time to time as appropriate and the progress made.

In recognition of the importance and value of gender diversity in the composition of the board, the board has one female director currently, representing 20% of total board membership. Su Nie has been a member of the board since December 2003.

Referring to all other directors who have served beyond nine (9) years, the board does not consider the requirement of their retirement (if any) to be in the best interests of the company.

The board is able to exercise objective judgment independently from management and no individual or small group of individuals dominate the decisions of the board.

Pursuant to Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST, with effect from 1 January 2022, a director will not be independent if he has been a director for an aggregate period of more than 9 years (whether before or after listing) and his continued appointment as an independent director has not been sought and approved in separate resolutions by (A) all shareholders; and (B) shareholders, excluding the directors and the chief executive officer of the issuer, and associates of such director and chief executive officer.

# Annual Report 2021

# Captii Limited

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Approval from shareholders has been obtained through a two-tier voting process at the annual general meeting held on 28 April 2021 for the continuation of Peng Hock and Paul as independent directors, who have served the company for an aggregate term of more than nine years.

Where necessary, the non-executive and independent directors meet without the presence of executive directors or management.

# Principle 3: Chairman and Executive Director

Tze Leng is the executive chairman of the board and Anton is the executive director of the company. They are not related to each other. The board having considered the number of non-executive and independent directors on the board, as well as the size and scope of the affairs and operations of the group, is of the view that its current structure has a strong independent element which enables the independent exercise of objective judgment on corporate affairs of the group. This is reinforced by the establishment of the various committees of which both Tze Leng and Anton are not members.

As the chairman of the board, Tze Leng is responsible for providing leadership to the board and ensuring that the board functions effectively. He is also responsible for, among others;

- (a) scheduling meetings of the board and setting the board meeting agenda in consultation with the company’s senior management;
- (b) exercising control over quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information between management and the board;
- (c) ensuring compliance with the company’s provisions on corporate governance; and
- (d) facilitating the effectiveness contribution of non-executive directors.

The roles of the executive chairman and executive director are separate and their responsibilities are clearly formalised. Supported by the team of chief executives from respective business units of the group, the executive chairman is responsible for providing overall leadership in the management of the group. The executive director, who was formerly the group chief executive to 1 September 2017, is primarily responsible for overseeing the venture investment and corporate development activities of the group. The management and the execution of business policies, strategies, objective and plans of the businesses within the group as formalised and adopted by the board, are carried out by the chief executive of each business together with the team of key executives reporting to him.

The board has on 26 February 2014 appointed Peng Hock as the lead independent director. The lead independent director will be available to shareholders where they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of the executive chairman or the executive director has failed to resolve their concerns or is inappropriate.

Led by the lead independent director, the non-executive and independent directors meet without the presence of other directors, where necessary.

# NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS

# Principle 4: Board Membership

# Principle 5: Board Performance

To facilitate a formal and transparent process for the appointment of new directors, the board has formed the NC which comprises:

- Chuah Seong Phaik (Chairman)
- Phuah Peng Hock (Member)
- Lee Su Nie (Member)

All three committee members are non-executive directors of the company. Except for Su Nie, all other members of the NC are independent directors.

The key terms of reference of the NC:

1. Reviewing and making recommendations to the board on:
- (a) The board succession plans for directors;
- (b) The process for performance evaluation of the board;
- (c) The training and professional development programs for the board; and
- (d) The appointment and re-appointment of directors.
2. Determining the director’s independence annually;
3. Deciding whether or not each director is able to and has adequately carried out his duties as a director of the company in particular where the director concerned has multiple board representations;
4. Deciding the evaluation of the board’s performance and proposing the objective of performance criteria to the board; and
5. Assessing the effectiveness of the board as a whole and the contributions by each individual director to the effectiveness of the board.

The role of the NC is to oversee the selection, appointment, re-appointment and induction process for directors. The NC also aims to maintain to a diversity of expertise, skills, gender, age and diversity of thought and background among the directors. Candidates are selected for their character, judgment and business acumen. New directors will be appointed based on NC’s recommendations.

Where a vacancy arises under any circumstances, or where it is considered that the board would benefit from the services of a new director, the NC, in consultation with the board, will review the composition of the board, including the mix of expertise, skills and attributes of existing directors, so as to identify needed and/or desired competencies to supplement the board’s existing attributes. Where it deems necessary or appropriate, the NC may seek assistance from external search consultants for the selection of potential candidates. After the NC chairman, the chairman of the board and the other NC members have interviewed the candidates, the candidates are shortlisted for the NC’s formal consideration for appointment to the board.

# Annual Report 2021

# Captii Limited

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Where a director has multiple board representations, the NC will evaluate whether or not a director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his or her duties as director of the group. The NC is in the view that sufficient time and attention has been given by the directors to the affairs of the company. The listed company directorships and principal commitments of each director, if any, is disclosed in the director’s profile. The maximum number of listed company representations which any director may hold is set to be not more than five (5). Currently there is no alternate director appointed to the board.

The profile that comprises key information of each of the directors is provided in page 15 to 16 of this annual report. As part of the process, the directors will complete appraisal forms which are then collated by the company secretary who will submit to the chairman of the NC in the form of a summary report. The summary report will be discussed during the NC meeting with a view to implementing recommendations to further enhance the effectiveness of the board.

Individual evaluation aims to assess whether each director continues to contribute effectively and demonstrate commitment to the role. The chairman should act on the results of the performance evaluation, and, in consultation with the NC, propose, where appropriate, new members to be appointed to the board or seek the resignation of directors.

The NC determines annually, and as and when circumstances require, whether a director is independent, based on the Code’s definition and taking into consideration the disclosures by the directors of any relationships with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers. Based on this review, the NC confirms the independence of the directors concerned.

# REMUNERATION MATTERS

The NC has reviewed the training needs for the directors in 2021 and encouraged directors to attend the relevant training courses that could enhance their knowledge to perform their duties as directors of the company.

Pursuant to the company’s constitution:

- (a) at least one third of the directors shall retire from office by rotation and be eligible for re-election at every AGM; and
- (b) directors appointed during the course of the financial year shall submit themselves for re-election at the next AGM of the company.

As such, the board has accepted the NC’s recommendation that Tze Leng and Su Nie, who are retiring pursuant to Article 103 of the company’s constitution be nominated for re-election at the forthcoming AGM (collectively the “retiring directors” and each a “retiring director”). In making the recommendation, the NC had considered the directors’ overall contributions and performance.

Pursuant to Rule 720(6) of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST, the additional information relating to the retiring directors as set out in Appendix 7.4.1 to the Listing Manual of SGX-ST is set out in Table F.

Each member of the NC shall abstain from voting on any resolutions in respect of the assessment of his or her performance or his or her re-nomination as a director.

The NC has adopted provisions for annual assessment of the effectiveness of the board as a whole and of the contribution of each individual director to the effectiveness of the board and has performed the necessary assent for the year.

The RC comprises all non-executive directors with the majority including the chairman being independent:

- Phuah Peng Hock (Chairman)
- Chuah Seong Phaik (Member)
- Lee Su Nie (Member)

The RC’s key terms of reference include:

1. Reviewing and making recommendation to the board a general framework of remuneration and specific remuneration packages for the board and key executives;
2. Reviewing and ensuring that the level and structure of remuneration should be aligned with the long-term interest and risk policies of the company, and should be appropriate and commercially competitive;
3. Structuring a significant and appropriate proportion of executive directors’ and key executives’ remuneration so as to link rewards to corporate and individual performance;
4. Reviewing and ensuring the remuneration of non-executive directors to be appropriate to the level of contribution, taking into account factors such as effort and time spent, and responsibilities of the directors;
5. Considering the various disclosure requirements for directors’ remuneration, particularly those required by regulatory bodies such as SGX Regco.

The RC seeks advice internally from the group corporate financial affairs and human resources director, who attends all RC meetings. If necessary, the RC may also seek professional advice externally on remuneration of directors, key executives or employees. The board did not engage any external remuneration consultant to advice on remuneration matters for 2021.

# Captii Limited

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The RC reviews the company’s obligations arising in the event of termination of the executive directors, key executive personnel’s contract of service, to ensure that such contracts of service contain fair and reasonable termination clauses which are not overly generous.

The remuneration of the executive directors and the key executives comprises of fixed and variable components. The fixed component is in the form of monthly base salary and allowance, while variable component is linked to the performance of the group and the individual.

The executive chairman is currently serving his service agreement which he has renewed for a further period of three (3) years with the company on 14 December 2021 (“service agreement”). The service agreement covers the terms of employment, specifically salary and other benefits.

In setting remuneration packages, the RC took into account the performance of the group as well as the directors and key executives by aligning their interests with those of the shareholders and linking rewards to corporate and individual performance as well as industry benchmarks. The review of remuneration packages takes into consideration the longer term interests of the group. The RC’s recommendation is made in consultation with the executive chairman and executive director and submitted for endorsement by the entire board. The payment of directors’ fees is subject to the approval by shareholders.

As the company operates mainly in the highly competitive telecommunications industry, the company is of the view that disclosure in incremental bands is sufficient and adequate, and that any further disclosure could be detrimental to the group’s interest, team spirit and the confidential nature of remuneration matters. While the exact remuneration of the individual directors and key executives is not given, the level and mix of remuneration in percentage terms of the individual directors and key executives in bands of S$250,000 are provided in Table C and D below.

# Annual Report 2021

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Captii Limited (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (the “group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the group and the statement of financial position of the company as at 31 December 2021, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows of the group, and statement of changes in equity of the company for the reporting year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the group and the financial position of the company as at 31 December 2021 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the group and of the changes in equity of the company for the reporting year ended on that date.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current reporting year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# a) Impairment testing of goodwill

Refer to Note 2A “Goodwill”, “Carrying amounts of non-financial assets” and Note 2C “Impairment assessment of goodwill” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, and Note 16 “Intangible assets” for the key assumptions used in impairment testing of goodwill.

As at the reporting year end, the group has goodwill of $9.9 million, comprising approximately 14% of the group’s total assets, which arose from the acquisition of business in a prior year. The amounts were allocated to a certain cash generating unit (“CGU”) as at 31 December 2021. The CGU and goodwill are assessed annually for impairment. Management used the value-in-use method to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill. The value-in-use calculation requires management of the group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU as well as a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value of the recoverable amount of each CGU. In estimating the future cash flows of the CGU, management forecasted the revenue, growth rates and margins based on presently available information. These estimates require judgement and the determination of the recoverable amount is a key area of focus.

We discussed with management the process used in determining various estimates such as forecasted revenues, growth rates, profit margins, tax rates and discount rates. As the assessment process is complex and highly judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, our audit procedures included, among others, using our in-house valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the group. We assessed management’s estimates applied in the value-in-use model based on our knowledge of the CGU’s operations, and compared them against historical forecasts and performance. Our in-house valuation specialists also performed a review of management’s methodology, expectations and the discount rate used in the impairment assessment and tested the accuracy of the computations. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive, that is, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill.

# b) Fair value of unquoted investments

Refer to Note 2A “Fair value measurement”, “Financial instruments” and Note 2C “Fair value of unquoted investments” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, and Note 20 “Other financial assets” for the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the unquoted investments.

# Annual Report 2021

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Key audit matters (cont’d)

# b) Fair value of unquoted investments (cont’d)

As at 31 December 2021, unquoted investments, comprising mainly of unquoted equity investments and unquoted debt securities, amounted to $28.5 million and represented approximately 40% of the group’s total assets. Included within this was an investment recognised by the group as at 7 December 2021 arising from an acquisition of a subsidiary. The fair value of the investment, determined on 7 December 2021, was $12.5 million. The fair value of the unquoted investment acquired on 7 December 2021 in connection with the acquisition of a subsidiary and the fair values of the substantial majority of the group’s unquoted investments as at 31 December 2021 were determined with the assistance of independent external specialists and applying valuation methodology that involved complex management’s judgments because these securities are not traded in an active market. The determination of the fair values of the financial instruments using Level 3 inputs is considerably more subjective given the lack of availability of market-based data.

We assessed the basis and process used by management in determining the fair values, the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used to revalue the unquoted financial instruments, and whether there were indicators that could adversely affect the valuation of each unquoted investment. The audit team was supported by our in-house valuation specialists to assess whether the valuations arrived at by the group were within a pre-defined range of acceptable differences, determined with reference to acceptable valuation practice, market practice and SFRS(I) 13 Fair Value Measurement. We also reviewed the independence, competence and experience of the independent external specialists used by management in assessing their objectivity, professional qualifications and resources. As part of these audit procedures, we assessed the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation, such as the expected operational performance and weighted average cost of capital by benchmarking them with external data. Finally, we also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements about the degree of estimation made when valuing these unquoted investments.

# Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the statement by directors and the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the financial reporting standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont’d)

(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.

(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.

(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Naveen Sasidaran.

# Captii Limited

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2021

# 1. General

Captii Limited (the “company”) is incorporated in Singapore with limited liability. It is listed on the Main board of the Singapore Exchange (“SGX”). The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and they cover the company (referred to as “parent”) and its subsidiaries.

The board of directors approved and authorised these financial statements for issue on the date of the statement by directors.

The principal activities of the company are those of investment holding and the provision of management services.

The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.

The registered office and principal place of business of the company is located at 140 Paya Lebar Road, #10-14 AZ@Paya Lebar, Singapore 409015.

# COVID-19 related disclosures

Management has considered the market conditions at the end of the reporting year and reviewed the probable impact and plausible downside scenarios, along with its responses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. No material uncertainties were identified in connection with the reporting entity’s ability to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.

# Statement of compliance with financial reporting standards

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) and the related Interpretations to SFRS(I) (“SFRS(I) INT”) as issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council. They are in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 and with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

# Accounting convention

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except where a financial reporting standard requires an alternative treatment (such as fair values) as disclosed where appropriate in these financial statements. The accounting policies in the financial reporting standards may not be applied when the effect of applying them is not material. The disclosures required by financial reporting standards may not be provided if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material.

# Basis of preparation of the financial statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Apart from those involving estimations, management has made judgements in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies. The areas requiring management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2C, where applicable.

# Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements made up to the end of the reporting year of the company and all of its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of the group (the parent and its subsidiaries) presented as those of a single economic entity and are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All significant intragroup balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the reporting entity obtains control of the investee and cease when the reporting entity loses control of the investee.

Changes in the group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for within equity as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. The carrying amounts of the group’s and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. When the group loses control of a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities and related equity components of the former subsidiary. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date when control is lost and is subsequently accounted as equity investments in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments.

The company’s separate financial statements have been prepared on the same basis, and as permitted by the Companies Act 1967, the company’s separate statement of comprehensive income is not presented.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2021

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information

# 2A. Significant accounting policies

# Revenue recognition

The financial reporting standard on revenue from contracts with customers establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer (which excludes estimates of variable consideration that are subject to constraints, such as right of return exists, trade discounts, volume rebates and changes to the transaction price arising from modifications), net of any related sales taxes and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. An asset (goods or services) is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that asset. As a practical expedient the effects of any significant financing component is not adjusted if the payment for the good or service will be within one year.

# Distinct goods or services in a series

For distinct goods or services in a series such as managed services where the promise under the contract is for a specified quantity of goods or services that meets the over time criteria or is a stand-ready or single continuous service and if the nature of each good or service is distinct, substantially the same and has the same pattern of transfer or each time increment is distinct, then revenue is recognised at the amount that the entity has the right to bill a fixed amount for each unit of goods or service provided.

# Distinct goods or services created over time

For long-term service contracts and projects for developing an asset such as system sales, the customer value is created over time during the contract period and it is accounted for as a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. This is because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity’s performance in processing each transaction as and when each transaction is processed; the performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or the performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The revenue is recognised over time by using the input method. For the input method, the revenue is recognised on the basis of the efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation such as costs incurred, relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.

# Provisions for losses on contracts

When the current estimates of the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer, and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is made as soon as the loss becomes evident. An adjustment is also made to reflect the effects of the customer’s credit risk. The loss on a contract is reported as an additional contract cost (an operating expense), and not as a reduction of revenue or a non-operating expense.

# Other income

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

# Government grants

Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with and that the grants will be received. Grants in recognition of specific expenses are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. Grants related to assets are presented in the statement of financial position by recognising the grants as deferred income that is recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful lives of the assets and in the proportions in which depreciation expense on those assets is recognised.

# Employee benefits

Certain subsidiaries have defined contribution retirement benefit plans in which employees are entitled to join upon fulfilling certain conditions. The entity contributes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the salary of each participating employee. Contributions are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Contributions to government managed retirement benefit plans such as the Central Provident Fund in Singapore and Employees Provident Fund in Malaysia which specify the employer’s obligations are dealt with as defined contribution retirement benefit plans. For employee leave entitlement the expected cost of short-term employee benefits in the form of compensated absences is recognised in the case of accumulating compensated absences, when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences; and in the case of non-accumulating compensated absences, when the absences occur. A liability for bonuses is recognised where the entity is contractually obliged or where there is constructive obligation based on past practice.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2021

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (cont’d)

# 2A. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

# Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowings and are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method.

# Foreign currency transactions

The functional currency of the company is the Singapore dollar as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. At each end of the reporting year, recorded monetary balances and balances measured at fair value that are denominated in non-functional currencies are reported at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year and fair value measurement dates respectively. All realised and unrealised exchange adjustment gains and losses are dealt with in profit or loss except when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. The presentation of these consolidated financial statements is in the functional currency of the company.

# Translation of financial statements of other entities

Each entity in the group determines the appropriate functional currency as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the relevant reporting entity operates. In translating the financial statements of such an entity for incorporation in the consolidated financial statements in the presentation currency, the assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at the end of the reporting year rates of exchange and the income and expense items for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange for the reporting year. The resulting translation adjustments (if any) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of that relevant reporting entity.

# Income tax

Income taxes are accounted using the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognised in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurements of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on provisions of the enacted or substantially enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current and deferred income taxes are recognised as income or as an expense in profit or loss unless the tax relates to items that are recognised in the same or a different period outside profit or loss. For such items recognised outside profit or loss the current tax and deferred tax are recognised (a) in other comprehensive income if the tax is related to an item recognised in other comprehensive income and (b) directly in equity if the tax is related to an item recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same income tax authority and entity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realised.

A deferred tax amount is recognised for all temporary differences, unless the deferred tax amount arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which (i) is not a business combination; and (ii) at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). A deferred tax liability or asset is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the reporting entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the taxable temporary difference and it is probable that the taxable temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or for deductible temporary differences, they will not reverse in the foreseeable future and they cannot be utilised against taxable profits.

# Plant and equipment

Plant and equipment are carried at cost on initial recognition and after initial recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to allocate the gross carrying amounts of the assets less their residual values over their estimated useful lives of each part of an item of these assets. The useful lives are as follows:

|Computers, telecommunications, research and development equipment|– 3 to 5 years|
|---|---|
|Office equipment, furniture, motor vehicle and renovation|– 5 years|

An asset is depreciated when it is available for use until it is derecognised even if during that period the item is idle. Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2021

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (cont’d)

# 2A. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

# Plant and equipment (cont’d)

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of plant and equipment is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is recognised in profit or loss. The residual value and the useful life of an asset is reviewed at least at each end of the reporting year and, if expectations differ significantly from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate, and the depreciation charge for the current and future periods are adjusted.

Cost also includes acquisition cost, borrowing cost capitalised and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset or component to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequent costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss when they are incurred.

# Right-of-use assets

The right-of-use assets are accounted and presented as if they were owned such as plant and equipment and are depreciated over the lease terms ranging from 2 to 5 years.

# Investment property

Investment property is property (land or a building or part of a building or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset under a finance lease) or held under a finance lease to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for: (a) use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or (b) sale in the ordinary course of business. It includes an investment property in the course of construction.

After initial recognition at cost including transaction costs, the fair value model is used to measure the investment property at fair value as of the end of the reporting year. A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment property is included in profit or loss for the reporting year in which it arises. The fair values are measured periodically on a systematic basis annually by external independent valuers having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued.

# Leases of lessee

A lease conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A right-of-use asset is capitalised in the statement of financial position, measured at the present value of the unavoidable future lease payments to be made over the lease term. A liability corresponding to the capitalised right-of-use asset is also recognised, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of any future restoration, removal or dismantling costs. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. An interest expense is recognised on the lease liability (included in finance costs). For short-term leases of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets (such as personal computers and small office equipment) where an accounting policy choice exists under the lease standard, the lease payments are expensed to profit or loss as incurred on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term.

# Intangible assets

An identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance is recognised as an intangible asset at acquisition cost if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. After initial recognition, an intangible asset with finite useful life is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. An intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity.

The amortisable amount of an intangible asset with finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life from the point at which the asset is ready for use. The useful lives are as follows:

- Deferred development costs (completed) – 5 years
- Intellectual property – 5 years

Development costs – Development costs are typically internally generated intangible assets. Costs incurred in relation to individual projects are capitalised only when the future economic benefit of the project is probable and the following main conditions are met: (i) the development costs can be measured reliably, (ii) the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained and (iii) therefore it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.

A subsidiary is an entity including unincorporated and special purpose entity that is controlled by the reporting entity and the reporting entity is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that the reporting entity has the practical ability to exercise (that is, substantive rights) are considered when assessing whether the reporting entity controls another entity. In the reporting entity’s separate financial statements, an investment in a subsidiary is accounted for at cost less any allowance for impairment in value. Impairment loss recognised in profit or loss for a subsidiary is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in a subsidiary are not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realised in a current market exchange.

# Associates

An associate is an entity including an unincorporated entity in which the reporting entity has a significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the reporting entity. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The group’s investment in an associate is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss financial assets in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments (see note on financial instruments below).

# Joint arrangement – joint venture

A joint arrangement (that is, either a joint operation or a joint venture, depending on the rights and obligations of the jointly controlling parties to the arrangement), is one in which the reporting entity is a party to an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control, which is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement; it exists only when decisions about the relevant activities (that is, activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a joint venture, the parties with joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

The reporting interests in joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method in accordance with the financial reporting standard on investments in associates and joint ventures.

Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of the investee’s net assets. The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in the joint venture are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realised in a current market exchange. The investor’s profit or loss includes its share of the investee’s profit or loss and the investor’s other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the reporting entity’s interest in the relevant joint venture are not recognised except to the extent that the reporting entity has an obligation. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the reporting entity and a joint venture are recognised in the financial statements only to the extent of unrelated reporting entity’s interests in the joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

Accounting policies of joint ventures are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the reporting entity. The reporting entity discontinues the use of the equity method from the date that when its investment ceases to be a joint venture and accounts for the investment in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments from that date. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former joint venture is measured at fair value at the date that it ceases to be a joint venture.

# Business combinations

A business combination is a transaction or other event which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. It is accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of a business combination includes the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the acquirer, in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquisition-related costs are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received except for any costs to issue debt or equity securities are recognised in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. As of the acquisition date, the acquirer recognises, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured at acquisition-date fair values as defined in and that meet the conditions for recognition under the financial reporting standard on business combinations. If there is gain on bargain purchase, for the gain on bargain purchase a reassessment is made of the identification and measurement of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the measurement of the cost of the business combination and any excess remaining after this reassessment is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

# Non-controlling interests

The non-controlling interest is equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the reporting entity as the parent. The non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the equity of the owners of the company.

For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (subsidiary) is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Where the non-controlling interest is measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and key model inputs used are disclosed in the relevant note. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.

Goodwill is recognised as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (a) over (b); (a) being the aggregate of: (i) the consideration transferred which generally requires acquisition-date fair value; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations (measured either at fair value or as the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets); and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and (b) being the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations.

After initial recognition, goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, goodwill and also any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or any intangible asset not yet available for use are tested for impairment, at least annually. Goodwill impairment is not reversed in any circumstances.

For the purpose of impairment testing since the acquisition date of the business combination, goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree were assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than a segment.

# Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

# Carrying amounts of non-financial assets

Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an annual impairment test is performed at about the same time every year on an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use. The carrying amount of other non-financial assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year for indications of impairment and where an asset is impaired, it is written down through profit or loss to its estimated recoverable amount. The impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount and is recognised in profit or loss. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. When the fair value less costs of disposal method is used, any available recent market transactions are taken into consideration. When the value-in-use method is adopted, in assessing the value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). At the end of each reporting year, non-financial assets other than goodwill with impairment loss recognised in prior periods are assessed for possible reversal of the impairment. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been measured, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

# Financial instruments

Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments:

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) are recognised and derecognised, as applicable, using trade date accounting or settlement date accounting. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. A financial liability is removed from the statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished, that is, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

At initial recognition the financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.

# Classification and measurement of financial assets:

1. Financial asset classified as measured at amortised cost: A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), that is (a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Typically trade and other receivables, bank and cash balances are classified in this category.
2. Financial asset that is a debt asset instrument classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”): There were no financial assets classified in this category at reporting year end date.
3. Financial asset that is an equity investment measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”): There were no financial assets classified in this category at reporting year end date.
4. Financial asset classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”): All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, management may irrevocably designate a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.

# Classification and measurement of financial liabilities:

Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) in either of the following circumstances: (1) the liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or (2) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. All other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Reclassification of any financial liability is not permitted.

# Cash and cash equivalents

For the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash and cash equivalents less cash subject to restriction and bank overdrafts payable on demand that form an integral part of cash management. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Other financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are presented within the section on operating activities as part of changes in working capital in the statement of cash flows.

# Fair value measurement

The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, market observable data to the extent possible is used. If the fair value of an asset or a liability is not directly observable, an estimate is made using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs (eg by use of the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar items, discounted cash flow analysis, or option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances). Inputs used are consistent with the characteristics of the asset / liability that market participants would take into account. The entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil a liability is not taken into account as relevant when measuring fair value.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2021

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (cont’d)

# 2A. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

# Fair value measurement (cont’d)

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the measurement are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices). Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.

The carrying values of current financial instruments not carried at fair values approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of such current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. The fair values of non-current financial instruments may not be disclosed separately unless there are significant differences at the end of the reporting year and in such event, the fair values are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements.

# Provisions

A liability or provision is recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A provision is made using best estimates of the amount required in settlement and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount recognised is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. Changes in estimates are reflected in profit or loss in the reporting year they occur.

# 2B. Other explanatory information

# Segment reporting

The reporting entity discloses financial and descriptive information about its consolidated reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. Generally, financial information is reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties

The critical judgements made in the process of applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting year are discussed below. These estimates and assumptions are periodically monitored to ensure they incorporate all relevant information available at the date when financial statements are prepared. However, this does not prevent actual figures differing from estimates.

# Impairment assessment of goodwill

An assessment is made annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment loss, based on the recoverable amounts of the cash generating unit (“CGU”). The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined based on value-in-use calculations and these calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates as disclosed in Note 16C. The assessment process is complex and highly judgemental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. The carrying amount of the group’s goodwill as at the end of the reporting year was $9,891,000 (2020: $10,061,000).

# Development costs

Development costs are capitalised as intangible assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2A. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established plan. Management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of profits. Should a project fail to substantiate its estimated feasibility or life cycle or other events or changes in circumstances arise that indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, material development costs may be required to be written off in future periods. The carrying amount has been disclosed in the Note on intangible assets.

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties (cont’d)

Expected credit loss allowance on trade receivables

The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the lifetime ECL for trade receivables. In measuring the expected credit losses, management considers all reasonable and supportable information such as the reporting entity’s past experience at collecting receipts, any increase in the number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, and forward looking information such as forecasts of future economic conditions (including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic). The carrying amounts might change materially within the next reporting year but these changes may not arise from assumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year. The carrying amount is disclosed in the Note on trade and other receivables.

Revenue recognised over time

The entity has revenue where the performance obligation is satisfied over time. Revenue is recognised over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. A single method is applied consistently for measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time. Judgment is required when selecting a method (output or input methods) for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation. Assessing the satisfaction of performance obligations over time requires judgment and the consideration of many criteria that should be met to qualify such as whether the customer presently is obligated to pay for an asset, whether the customer has legal title, whether the entity has transferred physical possession of the asset, whether the customer has assumed the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and whether the customer has accepted the asset. Events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected. Even if the events anticipated under the assumptions occur, actual results are still likely to be different from the estimates since other anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected and the variation may be material. The related account balances at the end of the reporting year are disclosed in the Notes on revenues, contract assets and contract liabilities.

Measurement of impairment of subsidiaries

When a subsidiary is in net equity deficit and has suffered operating losses, the recoverable amount of the investee is estimated to assess whether the investment in the investee has suffered any impairment. This measurement requires significant judgement. An estimate is made of the future profitability of the investee, and the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flows. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects. It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next reporting year that are different from assumptions could require adjustments to the carrying amount of the investments in subsidiaries. The carrying amount of the company’s specific assets at the end of the reporting year affected by the assumptions is $11,000,000 (2020: $11,000,000).

Fair value of unquoted investments

If a financial asset is not traded in an active market or if the quoted price is not readily and regularly available, the fair value is established by using valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. This measurement requires significant judgement. The fair value measurement requires the selection among a range of different valuation methodologies, making estimates about expected future cash flows and discount rates. The assumptions and the fair values are disclosed in the Notes on other financial assets and investment in an associate.

# 3. Related party relationships and transactions

The financial reporting standard on related party disclosures requires the reporting entity to disclose: (a) transactions with its related parties; and (b) relationships between parents and subsidiaries irrespective of whether there have been transactions between those related parties. A party is related to a party if the party controls, or is controlled by, or can significantly influence or is significantly influenced by the other party.

# 4. Financial information by operating segments

# 4A. Information about reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities

Disclosure of information about operating segments, products and services, the geographical areas, and the major customers are made as required by the financial reporting standard on operating segments. This disclosure standard has no impact on the reported financial performance or financial position of the reporting entity.

For management purposes, the reporting entity is organised into the three major strategic operating segments that offer different products and services. Such a structural organisation is determined by the nature of risks and returns associated with each business segment and it defines the management structure as well as the internal reporting system. It represents the basis on which the management reports the primary segment information that is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. They are managed separately because each business requires different strategies.

The segments and the types of products and services are as follows:

- Unifiedcomms – Segment for content-driven mobile value-added services (“VAS”), messaging and signalling systems, solutions and managed services.
- GlobeOSS – Segment for mobile network operation support systems, solutions and managed services.
- Captii Ventures – Segment for strategic investment in early and late-stage technology ventures.
- Others – Segment for investment holding and operational headquarters of the group.

Inter-segment sales are measured on the basis that the entity actually used to price the transfers. Internal transfer pricing policies of the reporting entity are as far as practicable based on market prices. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

The following tables illustrate the information about the reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities.

# 11. Income tax (cont’d)

# 11D. Unrecognised deferred tax assets (cont’d)

The other unrecognised deferred tax assets relate to tax losses and capital allowances which are available for unlimited
future periods. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the above balance as the future profit streams
are not probable against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. The realisation of the future
income tax benefits from tax losses carried forward and temporary differences from capital allowances is subject to the
conditions imposed by laws of the countries in which the entities in the group operate, including the retention of majority
shareholders as defined.

# 12. Earnings per share

The following table illustrates the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share of
no par value:

| | |Group| |
|---|---|---|---|
| | |2021|2020|
|$’000|Profit, net of tax attributable to owners of the company|9,075|3,347|

| | |Number of shares| |
|---|---|---|---|
| |2021|2020| |
|’000|Weighted average number of equity shares|31,957|31,957|

The weighted average number of equity shares refers to share in circulation during the reporting year.

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit, net of tax attributable to owners of the company by the above
weighted average number of ordinary shares.

Diluted earnings per share for the reporting years are computed using the same basis as basic earnings per share as
there are no potential dilutive ordinary shares.

As at 31 December 2021, the strata title of the investment property has not been issued by Department of Director General of Lands and Mines in Malaysia.

The investment property has been pledged for bank facilities (see Note 28B).

The fair value of the investment property was measured in December 2021 based on the highest and best use method to reflect the actual market state and circumstances as of the end of the reporting year. The fair value was based on a valuation made by C H Williams Talhar & Wong, a firm of independent professional valuers, which hold a recognised and relevant professional qualification with sufficient recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year. Management determined that the highest and best use of the assets is the current use and that it would provide maximum value to market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets.

For fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 (2020: Level 3) of the fair value hierarchy, a description of the valuation techniques and the significant other observable inputs used in the fair value measurement are as follows:

Asset: Freehold property at Lot 3A-5-1, 5th Floor, Block 3A, Plaza Sentral, 50470, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

Fair value: $2,137,000 (2020: $2,306,000)

Valuation technique for recurring fair value measurements: Comparison with market evidence of recent transaction prices for similar properties.

Significant observable inputs: Price per square foot. $265 (2020: $286)

Sensitivity on management’s estimates – 10% variation from estimate: Impact – lower by $214,000 (2020: $231,000); higher by $214,000 (2020: $231,000).

# 16C. Goodwill

Goodwill acquired through business combination has been allocated to its subsidiaries, Unified Communications Pte Ltd,
Postpay Asia Sdn Bhd, Postpay Sdn Bhd, Postpay Technology Sdn Bhd, Adzentrum Sdn Bhd, Unified Communications
(Private) Limited and Ahead Mobile Sdn Bhd for the purpose of impairment testing. The carrying amount is disclosed
above.

The goodwill was tested for impairment at the end of the reporting year. An impairment loss is the amount by which the
carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit (“CGU’’) exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value-in-use. The recoverable amount of the
CGU has been measured based on the value-in-use method.

The value-in-use was determined by management using discounted cash flow valuation technique. The key assumptions
used for value-in-use calculations, which are unobservable inputs, are as follows:

| |2021|2020|
|---|---|---|
|Unobservable inputs| | |
|Estimated discount rates that reflect current market assessments at the risks specific to the CGU|10.37%|13.09%|
|Growth rates based on management estimate forecasts and not exceeding the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets|2%|2%|
|Cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans approved by management|5 years|5 years|

The value-in-use is a recurring fair value measurement (Level 3).

Management also performed sensitivity analysis over the key inputs above and noted that no reasonably possible change
in any of these inputs would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to fall below its carrying amount.

(a) On 7 December 2021, the group’s subsidiary company, Captii Venture Ptd Ltd (“CVPL”) acquired an additional 21.4% equity interest in OOPA, resulting in OOPA becoming a subsidiary of the group.

|---|---|
|OOPA Pte Ltd|–|
|Investment holding. Singapore|35.6|

It is not meaningful to present the summarised financial information as the investment in associate was accounted as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) in the prior year in accordance with SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments (“SFRS(I) 9”).

On 6 September 2020, the group announced that a writ of summons and statement of claim (“Writ”) had been issued by its associated company, OOPA Pte Ltd (“OOPA”) against (i) Mr. Bui Sy Phong; (ii) Telio Pte Ltd (as a nominal defendant), a Singapore incorporated company of which Mr. Bui was a sole shareholder. Under the Writ, OOPA claimed against Mr. Bui, for inter alia, the following:

1. 100% of the shares in Telio and/or such associated company of Telio (or such percentage or number of shares as determined by the High Court of Singapore);
2. An order that Mr. Bui compensates OOPA in equity for breaches of director’s duties owed by him to OOPA; and
3. An account of profits received pursuant to the breaches of director’s duties owed by him to OOPA.

In 2019, management wrote down the investment value to nil in accordance with SFRS(I) 9. In previous reporting years, management was of the view that it is probable that the outcome of the Writ is favourable to OOPA, which may potentially increase the fair value of OOPA, and hence represent a contingent asset to OOPA. As SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets does not permit the recognition of contingent assets, management did not recognise the said fair value of OOPA in previous reporting years.

On 17 June 2021, the group announced that the High Court had on 16 June 2021 issued a judgment in favour of OOPA in relation to Suit No 885 of 2019 filed by OOPA against Mr. Bui.

On 18 June 2021, the group announced that Mr. Bui had on 17 June 2021 filed an appeal against the decision of the High Court to the Appellate Division of the High Court of Singapore.

On 26 October 2021, the group announced that through a deed of settlement entered into between OOPA, Mr. Bui and Telio on 25 October 2021, the parties had come to a full and final settlement of all claims in connection with, relating to, or arising out of the subject matter of the Suit.

On 7 December 2021, the group announced that the completion of the deed had taken place, and Mr. Bui had formally withdrawn his appeal.

Subsequent to the completion of the above, the group assessed that it had acquired a controlling stake in OOPA, making OOPA a subsidiary of the group. Also, see Note 17.

# 20C. Fair value measurements (Level 3) recognised in the statement of financial position

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The group adopted the following valuation methodologies in estimating the fair values of the investments:

1. Cost approach: This is applied to estimate fair value of companies in very preliminary development stages where revenue forecasts are difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty, and assumes the book value or cost of an asset approximates its fair value. Adjustments, such as impairment allowance, are made to assets on a case-by-case basis if this assumption does not hold true.
2. Option Pricing Model (“OPM”): The OPM, which applies the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing, is a generally accepted valuation methodology used in estimating fair values of early stage companies, in particular those with different classes of shares. In applying the OPM to determine the fair value of an investee, management considers terms such as level of seniority among the securities, dividend policy, conversion ratios, and cash allocations of the various stockholders’ agreements with the investee that would affect the distributions to each class of equity upon a liquidity event. In addition, the method implicitly considers the effect of the liquidation preference as of the future liquidation date, not as of the valuation date.
3. Implied Enterprise Value (“Implied EV”): The implied EV model estimates the enterprise value based on an adjusted implied EV/Revenue multiple and applies the OPM model based on Black-Scholes model, to allocate the estimated enterprise value to various classes of shares.

The key assumptions used in applying the OPM and implied EV models which are unobservable inputs, were as follows:

|Unobservable inputs|2021|2020|Sensitivity of inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|---|
|Risk free rates (range)|0.3% – 3.3%|0.15% – 2.86%|Increase (decrease) of the inputs would result in|
|Asset volatility (range)|22% – 92%|27.92% – 100%|decrease (increase) in fair values|
|Expected terms (years)|1.4 to 5|1.33 to 3.10| |

The group has the policy to regularly assess and evaluate the appropriate valuation methodologies in ascertaining the fair value of the investments.

# 22. Trade and other receivables (cont’d)

The expected credit losses (“ECL”) on the above trade receivables are based on the simplified approach to measuring ECL which uses a lifetime ECL allowance approach for all trade receivables recognised from initial recognition of these assets. These assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due for measuring the ECL. The allowance matrix is based on the historical observed default rates (over a period of 36 months over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic). At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

| |Gross amount| |Loss allowance| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| |2021|2020|2021|2020|
|Group| | | | |
|Ageing of trade receivables:|Within due date|$’000|–|–|
| |1 to 90 days past due|$1,503|–|$15|
| |91 to 270 days past due|$2,459|–|$6|
| |Over 270 days past due|$48|$46|$15|
|Total|$8,938|$7,359|$46|$36|

The amounts are written-off when there are indications that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery or the failure of a debtor to make contractual payments over an extended period. There are no collateral held as security and other credit enhancements for the trade receivables.

As part of the process of setting customer credit limits, different credit terms are used. The average credit period generally granted to trade customers is between 30 to 90 days (2020: 30 to 90 days). But some customers take a longer period to settle the amounts.

# Concentration of trade receivable customers as at the end of reporting year:

| |Group| | |
|---|---|---|---|
| |2021|$’000|%|
|Top 1 customer|$3,937|44| |
|Top 2 customers|$4,992|56| |
|Top 3 customers|$5,922|66| |

Other receivables are also subject to the ECL model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. The other receivables can be graded for credit risk individually. At inception, they are recorded net of expected 12 month credit losses. At each reporting date, an evaluation is made whether there is a significant change in credit risk by comparing the debtor’s credit risk at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified cash flows) with the credit risk at the reporting date (based on the modified cash flows). Adjustment to the loss allowance is made for any increase or decrease in credit risk. At the end of the reporting year a loss allowance is recognised at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Other receivables of the group and company are normally with no fixed terms and therefore there is no maturity. Other receivables are regarded as of low credit risk if they have a low risk of default and the debtor has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term. The methodology applied for impairment loss depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

A loss allowance of $497,000 (2020: $497,000) has been recognised for other receivables of the company.

The contract assets are entity’s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on the contracts. The contract assets are transferred to the receivables when the rights become unconditional. The entity recognises revenue for each respective performance obligation when control of the product or service transfers to the customer.

The decrease of contract assets are due to lesser uncompleted projects at the end of reporting year.

Contract assets are subject to the ECL model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. No loss allowance was necessary as at end of the reporting year.

The ordinary shares of no par value are fully paid, carry one vote each and have no right to fixed income. The company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

# Capital management:

The objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the reporting entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for owners and benefits for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to owners by pricing the sales commensurately with the level of risk. The management sets the amount of capital to meet its requirements and the risk taken. There were no changes in the approach to capital management during the reporting year. The management manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it where necessary or possible in the light of changes in conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the management may adjust the amount of dividends paid to owners, return capital to owners, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

In order to maintain its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange, the company has to have share capital with at least a free float of 10% of the shares. The company met the capital requirement on its initial listing and the rules limiting treasury share purchases mean it will continue to satisfy that requirement, as it did throughout the reporting year. Management receives a report from the share registrars frequently on substantial share interests showing the non-free float to ensure continuing compliance with the 10% limit throughout the reporting year.

The management does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to support its business and to add value for shareholders. The key discipline adopted is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed and the cost of that capital. There are no significant external borrowings. The debt-to-adjusted capital ratio does not provide a meaningful indicator of the risk of borrowing.

Variable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate or based on a percentage of revenue are not included from the initial measurement of the lease liabilities and the right-of-use assets.

The leases are for office space. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised is 5.4% (2020: 5.4%) per year.

A summary of the maturity analysis of lease liabilities is disclosed in Note 30E. Total cash outflows from leases are shown in the statement of cash flows. The related information of right-of-use-assets are disclosed in Note 14.

# 30. Financial instruments: information on financial risks (cont’d)

# 30B. Financial risk management

The main purpose for holding or issuing financial instruments is to raise and manage the finances for the entity’s operating, investing and financing activities. There are exposures to the financial risks on the financial instruments such as credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk comprising interest rate, currency risk and price risk exposures. Management has certain practices for the management of financial risks and action to be taken in order to manage the financial risks. The guidelines include the following:

- (i) Minimise interest rate, currency, credit and market risks for all kinds of transactions.
- (ii) Maximise the use of “natural hedge”: favouring as much as possible the natural off-setting of sales and costs and payables and receivables denominated in the same currency and therefore put in place hedging strategies only for the excess balance. The same strategy is pursued with regard to interest rate risk.
- (iii) All financial risk management activities are carried out and monitored by senior management staff.
- (iv) All financial risk management activities are carried out following acceptable market practices.
- (v) Consideration is given to investing in financial instruments in accordance with the investment strategy of the reporting entity.

There have been no changes to the exposures to risk; the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk.

The group and company are exposed to currency and interest rate risks. There are no arrangements to reduce such risk exposures through derivatives and other hedging instruments.

# 30C. Fair value of financial instruments

The analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These include the significant financial instruments stated at amortised cost and at fair value in the statement of financial position. The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

# 30D. Credit risk on financial assets

Financial assets that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk and failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations in full or in a timely manner. These arise principally from cash balances with banks, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the total of the fair value of the financial assets at the end of the reporting year. Credit risk on cash balances with banks and any other financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are entities with acceptable credit ratings. For expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets, the three-stage approach in the financial reporting standard on financial instruments is used to measure the impairment allowance. Under this approach, the financial assets move through the three stages as their credit quality changes.

However, a simplified approach is permitted by the financial reporting standards on financial instruments for financial assets that do not have a significant financing component, such as trade receivables and contract assets. Management adopts the simplified approach to measure the impairment loss for financial assets. On initial recognition, a day-1 loss is recorded equal to the 12 month ECL (or lifetime ECL for trade receivables), unless the assets are considered credit impaired. For credit risk on trade receivables, contract assets and other financial assets, an ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the debtors and an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Reviews and assessments of credit exposures in excess of designated limits are made. Renewals and reviews of credits limits are subject to the same review process.

Note 24 discloses the maturity of the cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of the standard on financial instruments. There was no identified impairment loss.

# 30E. Liquidity risk – financial liabilities maturity analysis

The liquidity risk refers to the difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. It is expected that all the liabilities will be settled at their contractual maturity. The average credit period taken to settle trade payables is about 30 to 60 days (2020: 30 to 60 days). The other payables are with short-term durations. The classification of the financial assets is shown in the statement of financial position as they may be available to meet liquidity needs and no further analysis is deemed necessary.

The company provides financial guarantees to financial institutions for banking facilities granted to subsidiaries (see Note 28). These financial guarantees are provided without charge.

# Financial guarantee contracts

For issued financial guarantee contracts, the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee could be called. At the end of the reporting year, no claims on the financial guarantees are expected to be payable.

| |Less than 1 year| |
|---|---|---|
|Company| | |
|Financial guarantee contracts – in favour of subsidiaries|2021: 274|2020: 970|

Financial guarantee contracts if significant are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance the financial reporting standard on financial instruments and (b) the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of the financial reporting standard on revenue from contracts with customers.

The above table shows sensitivity to a hypothetical percentage variation in the functional currencies of the group’s companies against the relevant material non-functional foreign currencies. The sensitivity rate used is the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. For a similar rate weakening of the functional currencies against the relevant foreign currencies above, there would be comparable impacts in the opposite direction on profit or loss.

The hypothetical changes in exchange rates are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The sensitivity analysis is disclosed for each non-functional currency to which the entity has significant exposure at end of the reporting year. The analysis above has been carried out on the basis that there are no hedged transactions.

In management’s opinion, the above sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the foreign currency risks as the historical exposure does not reflect the exposure in future.

# (b) Litigation

On 19 November 2013, Unified Telecom Private Limited (“UTPL”), a joint venture of Unified Communications Pte Ltd (“UCPL”), filed a petition to the High Court of Delhi, New Delhi in India under Section 9 of India Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to obtain interim relief on the protection of assets currently under the custody of a former customer, a mobile telecoms network operator and service provider in India (the “Telco”), and to deny the penalty claims by the Telco against UTPL.

The Telco had via a letter issued in July 2013 alleged that UTPL is liable for a sum of INR 11.3 crore (approximately $2.1 million) for damages and expenditure incurred in connection with the contract during its currency.

Legal advice has been sought from reputable law firms in both India and Singapore with good credentials in handling contract litigation and dispute resolution, to review and advise on the merit of this claim by the Telco on UTPL. Based on the legal opinions obtained from the law firm concerned, management is of the view that UTPL has full rights and title to the assets and should be entitled to demand their return, and that the Telco’s claim against UTPL has no legal merit. Accordingly, external legal counsels in Singapore and India have been appointed to advise and represent UCPL and UTPL to pursue legal recourse.

As announced by the company on 16 January 2015, the hearing on the petition filed by UTPL which was originally scheduled to be heard on 23 April 2014, having been adjourned on several occasions, was dismissed by the High Court, as the Telco had initiated the arbitration proceedings before a tribunal. The High Court was of the view that the matter should be resolved through arbitration proceedings since the tribunal had already been constituted.

In 2015, UTPL commenced an application pursuant to Section 17 of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 for, amongst others, the return of the Assets. However, the learned Arbitrator dismissed the application, but directed Telco to ensure the safety of and protect the assets from any damage during the period the Hardware is lying in Telco’s premises.

A number of procedural hearings have been held by the Arbitrator to cross examine the affidavits of the admissions and denial documents relating to the aforesaid claim and counterclaims throughout the years. The case is currently at the stage of evidence. On 22 August 2020, the Arbitrator allowed UTPL’s application for inspection and production of the documents referred to by the Telco’s witness in the course of cross examination in which to be produced by the Telco on 5 September 2020.

On 5 September 2020, the Telco raised a procedural objection under the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 2015, which is pending determination by the Arbitrator before cross examination of witnesses may proceed.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no hearings were scheduled in 2021. In 2021, there were two hearings which took place on 15 February 2021 and 19 February 2021 respectively. The Arbitration had directed both parties to file written submissions for seeking extension of time to 26 February 2021.

The arbitration is currently ongoing before the Hon’ble Arbitral Tribunal and is at the stage of Respondent’s evidence. UTPL has introduced three witnesses. The cross examination of the first witness commenced on 16 October 2021 via Zoom conference in view of current COVID-19 pandemic. The Hon’ble Tribunal had scheduled and completed further hearings between January 2022 and March 2022 for cross examination of UTPL’s witnesses. The next hearing has been set on 2 April 2022.

In the opinion of management, no material losses are expected to arise pertaining to the aforesaid contingent matter.

# 34. Prior year adjustments and restatement of financial statements

A prior year adjustment of $2.059 million was made in respect of the group’s financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, as a result of an understatement of fair value gains on an unquoted investment held at fair value through profit or loss. The adjustment was made to correct an error in an input parameter used in the valuation performed on an investee company, in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) 1-8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.

While there was no restatement to the consolidated statement of financial position at 1 January 2020, as required by the financial reporting standard on the presentation of financial statements, the third statement of consolidated financial position at the beginning of the preceding reporting year is presented. Apart from these disclosures, other balances and notes are not impacted by the restatements.

The effect of the above adjustment to the group’s financial statement for 2020 is as follows:

|Group|As reported|Adjustment|As restated|
|---|---|---|---|
|Consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020|$’000|$’000|$’000|
|Retained earnings|17,937|2,059|19,996|
|Other financial assets|11,770|2,059|13,829|
|Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the financial year end 31 December 2020| | | |
|Other income and gains|115|1,884|1,999|
|Other losses|(371)|175|(196)|
|Profit, net of tax|2,121|2,059|4,180|
|Profit for the year attributable to Owners of the company|1,288|2,059|3,347|
|Total comprehensive income for the year attributable to Owners of the company|1,369|2,059|3,428|
|Consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year end 31 December 2020| | | |
|Cash flows from operating activities| | | |
|Profit before tax|2,889|2,059|4,948|
|Fair value loss (gain) on unquoted investments|175|(2,059)|(1,884)|

The effect of the correction on the basic and diluted earnings per share for 2020 was a change from 4.03 cents to 10.47 cents.
