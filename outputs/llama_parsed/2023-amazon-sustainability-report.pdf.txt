# Introduction

# A Letter from Our Chief Sustainability Officer

At Amazon, we are always looking for ways to move faster, deliver the best possible customer experience, and innovate. We regularly hear from our customers, corporate partners, and employees how much they care about sustainability and social responsibility. For a company as diverse as Amazon, embedding these values into all of our businesses, products, and services—as well as how we deliver for our customers—has been an incredible undertaking, with much of it taking place behind-the-scenes.

Progress is likely easiest to spot in our Stores business. Our customers let us know that their Amazon packages are now arriving at their doorsteps faster, with less packaging, and delivered by more electric delivery vehicles than ever before. By regionalizing our operations and transportation networks in the U.S., we can now deliver items faster and at lower costs. This also allows us to minimize or avoid extra packaging altogether, while reducing the distance a package has to travel, cutting back on the carbon emissions associated with deliveries.

We know that driving change means staying focused on bringing entire industries along with us. Over the past five years, we’ve done this by encouraging companies to join The Climate Pledge—and we’re proud that over 500 have joined us and committed to be net-zero carbon 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. But we wanted to do more. Most recently, our sustainability team has been developing resources to share our expertise and help our suppliers build, measure, and act on their sustainability commitments. That’s why we’ve launched the Amazon Sustainability Exchange, a free sustainability resource center that contains a number of Amazon’s previously proprietary playbooks, templates, case studies, and science models, among other sustainability best practices.

Looking ahead, we know our customers look to us to be at the cutting edge of new and growing technologies and enable them for good. We’re already deploying artificial intelligence (AI) in ways that benefit our customers directly, such as using it to right-size packaging and avoid waste. We’re exploring a growing number of AI applications—whether it’s monitoring and optimizing our energy use or helping combat deforestation in Brazil. We also see an opportunity to use AI to address sustainability challenges at an unprecedented scale, all while delivering new solutions for our customers. Much work remains, and we’re excited that Amazon is uniquely positioned to figure out how AI can help us address climate change in a more efficient and responsible way.

Most importantly, we need to continue to invest in talent and hire employees who can lead on sustainability. We’re proud of the wide range of sustainability-focused career paths we offer at Amazon, including engineers, scientists, content creators, building architects, and more. And for those whose jobs aren’t directly within a sustainability field, we offer upskilling programs and affinity groups where our employees can learn more and get involved. It’s thanks to the thousands of professionals working behind-the-scenes across Amazon that we are able to bring all of this amazing work to life.

I’m proud of the work that’s underway, and truly excited for what’s to come.

With gratitude,

Kara Hurst
Chief Sustainability Officer

The science is clear. Significant carbon emission reductions are required to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, restore biodiversity, protect vulnerable communities, and ensure a habitable planet for future generations. Climate change also has the potential to disrupt global supply chains and change the ways businesses operate today. We have an opportunity—and responsibility—to use our size, scale, and resources to do our part to solve global challenges. In 2019, we co-founded and committed to The Climate Pledge—our goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. We are continually working to reduce emissions throughout our business, as well as partnering across our supply chain and the industries in which we operate to share and scale what we’ve learned.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Our Approach

At Amazon, we think long term, take on grand challenges, and invent solutions to complex problems. These are some of the reasons we co-founded and committed to The Climate Pledge in 2019—our goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement—and have invited hundreds of companies to join us.

# Carbon

- We select lower-carbon alternatives, such as lower-carbon concrete and steel in construction, and lower-emission fuels and vehicles in transportation. We use these alternatives where possible, based on a number of factors including cost, emissions reduction potential, and availability.
- We’re transitioning toward carbon-free electricity, investing in renewables—rooftop solar installations on our buildings, and new, utility-scale wind and solar projects—as well as other carbon-free electricity sources, such as nuclear.
- We engage with suppliers to help reduce emissions from activities beyond our direct operations. We encourage them to set credible decarbonization goals, publicly share progress, and implement carbon reduction strategies throughout their operations and supply chains —and we are providing support to help our supply chain take action.

Foundationally, our strategy relies on embedding decarbonization initiatives and efficiency improvements across our business. Our comprehensive approach to reducing and avoiding carbon emissions focuses on key sectors of our business, including delivery and logistics; building construction and operations; servers and hardware; grocery, products, and devices; and packaging. Teams across Amazon are accountable for setting decarbonization plans that map back to Amazon’s worldwide strategy because ownership and accountability are critical to operational success and managing complexity. We focus on four crosscutting initiatives to decarbonize our business:

- We focus first on driving efficiency across our operations to reduce and avoid emissions at scale. This includes improving transportation routing, increasing pack and fill rates, improving cloud-computing chip efficiency, adding Low Power Mode to devices, and installing energy-efficient lighting and HVAC solutions in buildings.
- We invest in breakthrough technology by adopting ready-to-scale solutions, as well as evaluating and investing in emerging technologies that can help address emissions from hard-to-abate sectors including aviation, shipping, and building construction. Through direct funding, we aim to advance our own progress toward net-zero carbon emissions and help accelerate the widespread adoption of new technologies by making them more affordable and accessible.
- We support policies that drive decarbonization. Amazon works with policymakers, governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), industry associations, coalitions, and other partners on numerous regulatory and policy issues. We seek to advance and incentivize decarbonization by supporting policies that scale lower-emission fuels, drive lower-emission vehicle deployment and infrastructure, advance the deployment of carbon-free energy, modernize the grid, and accelerate investments in clean technologies.
- We catalyze industry action. Through The Climate Pledge, Amazon brings together companies from around the world to drive collective action, cross-sector collaboration, and engagement in initiatives that encourage industry action toward decarbonization.

In parallel to reducing and avoiding emissions throughout our business, we are also investing in carbon neutralization through additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets. As part of this effort, we are engaging in science-led collaborations to build credible neutralization initiatives that can be deployed at scale in the future.

In 2023, our net sales grew 12% and more than two-thirds of Amazon packages were delivered via Amazon’s own logistics network. We decreased emissions per package through operational efficiencies, such as improving truck fill rates (the percentage of truck volume that is utilized), shipping products in their own packaging without additional Amazon packaging, and using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize packaging types. For example, Amazon data scientists trained an AI model to understand a variety of product attributes, including an item’s shape and durability, and to analyze customer feedback on how different packaging options have performed. The model is constantly learning and has helped reduce our use of packaging material since it launched in 2019.

We strive to keep our packaging lightweight and minimal, while ensuring products reach customers without damage. Lighter, more flexible, and right-sized packaging helps reduce delivery emissions per package by using less material and taking up less space in delivery vehicles. Since 2015, we have reduced the average per-shipment packaging weight by 43% and avoided more than 3 million metric tons of packaging, including more than 446,000 metric tons in 2023 alone.

Globally, we shipped 12% of products in their own packaging in 2023. This provides a better customer experience by minimizing the packaging materials used for delivery, and avoids incremental carbon emissions associated with additional materials and weight.

In 2023, we are proud to have achieved our goal to match 100% of the electricity consumed by our global operations with renewable energy—seven years ahead of our original 2030 goal. This achievement was driven by scaling up our portfolio of renewable energy projects. Our journey has included enabling major solar, wind, and battery storage projects around the world, including the first wind farm in Mississippi, and becoming the first corporate purchaser to invest in renewable energy projects in countries such as Indonesia, Poland, and South Africa.

With this scale, we have been named the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the fourth year in a row.

# Scope 3: Indirect Emissions from Other Sources

Scope 3 emissions include emissions from activities that take place beyond our direct operations, including building construction, third-party transportation, and the production of Amazon-branded products and the materials and components used in those products. In 2023, our Scope 3 emissions decreased by 5% from 2022 and represented 75% of our total carbon footprint. This decrease resulted from reductions related to building construction, leased buildings and equipment, and third-party transportation, as more goods were shipped by Amazon’s own logistics providers versus third-party providers than in 2022.

# Key Milestones on Our Net-Zero Carbon Journey

Building construction is a significant driver of carbon emissions in many supply chains due to the associated embodied carbon that is emitted. Embodied carbon includes any carbon emissions created during the manufacturing of building materials, the transport of those materials to the job site, and the construction practices used. Embodied carbon is counted in a company’s carbon footprint the year the building is completed and operational. We aim to reduce embodied carbon in building construction by using lower-emission concrete, lower-emission steel, and mass timber. In 2023, 29 Amazon building projects were constructed with lower-carbon concrete and steel, and collectively reduced embodied carbon by 79,500 metric tons of CO2e, equivalent to the emissions generated by 17,200 cars driven for a year.

Because Scope 3 emissions are beyond our direct operational control, the efforts our suppliers take to reduce their emissions help us progress toward our ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. We will prioritize working with suppliers who are also committed to decarbonization and reaching net-zero carbon emissions. We have identified a list of the highest-emitting suppliers directly supporting our operations, and expect those suppliers, who collectively contribute more than 50% of emissions globally to Amazon’s Scope 3 footprint, to provide a plan for how they will decarbonize their operations and demonstrate real progress over time.

# Path to 2040

We know the path to net-zero carbon by 2040 will be challenging, but we are making investments, creating new ways of working, and inventing new solutions to help us decarbonize now and in the future. At Amazon, we think long term, and we’re committed to working collectively with our supply chain and industry partners to create and scale new decarbonization solutions.

# Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge

We’re proud of the work we do, not just within our own operations but across the many industries of which we are a part. At the end of 2023, The Climate Pledge included 473 signatories focused on achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Signatories are working together more than ever before, with five new joint action projects launched in 2023. We are also investing in companies that are building breakthrough technologies and other solutions that could, longer-term, lower the overall cost of decarbonization, even in hard-to-abate sectors. One way we do this is through The Climate Pledge Fund, Amazon’s $2 billion venture investment program, which supports the advancement of sustainability-focused technologies and services that will enable us to meet our net-zero carbon emissions goal.

# Delivery and Logistics

We rely on a complex transportation network to get products from manufacturers and sellers to customers around the globe. Our logistics network uses different modes of transportation, including ships, planes, freight trains, trucks, vans, and bikes, across three transportation legs:

- First mile is the first transportation leg, used for transporting shipments from the manufacturer or supplier to an Amazon facility. First mile includes maritime and airfreight shipping, as well as movement by truck and rail.
- Middle mile is the intermediate transportation leg, where we move shipments between Amazon facilities. It is also called long-distance transportation. Middle mile includes commercial trucking, aviation, maritime, and intermodal sea and rail.
- Last mile is the final transportation leg that delivers packages from Amazon to customers. It includes vans, trucks, and micromobility solutions such as e-cargo bikes and on-foot delivery.

We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to transport products safely, quickly, efficiently, and more sustainably. We are decarbonizing first, middle, and last mile transportation by:

- Increasing routing and fleet efficiency. In 2023, we restructured our U.S. fulfillment operations by reorganizing our national network of fulfillment centers, intermediate sort centers, last mile delivery hubs, and transportation fleet into eight regions. This shift ensures we’re producing, packaging, and shipping from facilities that are closer to the communities we serve, which reduces the complexity of our shipping network and the miles traveled to get to our customers—helping drive down both carbon emissions and shipping costs. This new model optimizes delivery speed, reduces emissions, and provides the breadth of selection that customers expect. In the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, we shipped nearly 544 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers than we did during the same period of 2022.
- Increasing packaging and packing efficiency. We focus on increasing pack and fill rates—the percentage of package volume that is utilized—and truck fill rates—the percentage of truck volume that is utilized—to fit more products into shipping vehicles. This reduces the number of trucks we need—and the carbon emissions associated with them—to deliver our products.
- Scaling use of EVs and micromobility solutions. Sending demand signals and scaling availability of alternative transportation solutions is critical to accelerating industry progress. This includes charging infrastructure, electric trucks, electric delivery vehicles, e-cargo bikes, e-mopeds, and on-foot deliveries from micromobility hubs.
- Increasing use of alternative-fuel vehicles and low-carbon fuels. The early adoption of lower-carbon fuels is another way we are working to minimize the carbon footprint of our transportation and logistics network, as well as a critical component to building out the alternative fuels market. We are investing in lower-carbon fuels today to encourage industry development and demand, with the goal of ultimately making them more accessible and affordable for everyone.
- Partnering on initiatives to decarbonize transportation. We participate in multi-stakeholder initiatives to shift the industry toward lower-carbon solutions at scale, such as EVs, charging infrastructure, and lower-carbon fuels.
- Creating lower-carbon shipping options for customers. We focus on consolidating shipments to reduce deliveries, as well as reducing packaging by shipping more items in each box and more items in their original packaging.

Zero Emission Vessels (coZEV) with the Aspen Institute to support initiatives that increase the availability of zero-emission technologies and fuels while gaining support from shipping lines, cargo owners, ports, and other organizations that can help to enable the energy transition. Through our membership, we are supporting coZEV’s goal to use maritime ships with zero-emission fuels for 100% of ocean cargo by 2040.

Aviation is also considered a hard-to-abate sector, which is why we are sourcing lower-carbon aviation fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and using SAF credits to reduce our own airfreight emissions as well as working with peers on innovative industry-wide solutions. Lower-carbon aviation fuel, such as SAF, currently represents less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel and remains cost-prohibitive for most companies. To help address these challenges, Amazon is a founding member of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) and played a critical role in launching the Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc) Registry at the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28). The SAFc Registry aims to bring more transparency to emissions reduction claims and accelerate SAF deployment.

# Journey of a Kindle through Our Transportation Network

Products travel through Amazon’s transportation network from manufacturers and sellers to customers around the globe. An Amazon Kindle starts its journey at a manufacturing facility in China, traveling through various ports, a crossdock, a fulfillment center, and a delivery station before it is delivered to the customer in Valencia, Spain.

|Port|First Mile|Manufacturing Facility|
|---|---|---|
|Rotterdam, NL|Rotterdam, NL|CN|
|Shenzhen, CN|Crossdock|Rotterdam, NL|
|Middle Mile|Fulfillment Center|Delivery Station|
|Madrid, ES|Madrid, ES|Valencia, ES|

Middle mile transportation starts when packages arrive at an Amazon facility and covers the journey between fulfillment centers and sort centers to delivery stations. In addition to enhancing routing efficiency through regionalization, we are decarbonizing middle mile transportation by increasing the number of EVs on the road and at our facilities and adopting lower-carbon fuels. We also partner with others to create industry solutions that accelerate decarbonization of this leg of the transportation network.

# Middle Mile Efficiency

Moving products by rail or sea—instead of on the road, by conventional trucks—reduces carbon emissions by an average of nearly 50%. Europe’s geographic landscape and infrastructure in particular often make rail and sea the faster and more efficient routing options. In 2023, we increased our use of rail and ocean transportation in Europe by over 50%, distributing products through more than 100 rail lanes and more than 300 sea routes across the continent. This reduced our demand for more carbon-intensive transportation methods, such as trucks, in Europe. Additionally, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.

# Airfreight

While we prioritize ocean transportation, air transportation is an important part of our first mile logistics network, though it represents only 10% of our transoceanic imports.

In 2023, we increased our total rail load volume by 45% in Europe and 25% in the U.S. Our sustainable rail freight solutions were recognized by BNSF Railway, which selected Amazon as one of the recipients of its 2023 Sustainability Award.

# Middle Mile Electric Vehicles

Scaling up middle mile EVs is another way we aim to decarbonize our logistics network, both on the road and at our logistics facilities. Amazon and delivery service providers (DSPs) deployed more than 245 electric middle mile vehicles in 2023. We also have nearly 18,000 hydrogen-powered forklifts operating at more than 81 fulfillment centers, as well as 110 electric yard hostlers—vehicles that move truck trailers around fulfillment centers—in North America.

Amazon recognizes that the infrastructure needed to support the charging of electric heavy goods vehicles (eHGVs) at delivery stations and on the road is one barrier to scaling their use around the world. That is why we work with eHGV manufacturers and other partners to improve charging infrastructure and electricity grids.

# Last Mile

Last mile transportation refers to the final part of the delivery journey. This is when products are transported from sort centers and delivery stations to customers via delivery vans, electric delivery vehicles (four-wheel, three-wheel, two-wheel, and e-mopeds), and micromobility solutions, including e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries.

# Partnerships Accelerating Middle Mile Decarbonization

Trucking is a challenging area to decarbonize, particularly considering the long-haul distances driven and the requirements for high-power EV charging infrastructure across transportation routes. Identifying and scaling solutions for this important method of transportation cannot be done by one company alone—it requires the know-how, resources, and experience of collaborative partners across industries and sectors.

# Last Mile Electric Delivery Vehicles

Increasing the number of EVs in Amazon’s delivery fleet is an important part of our approach to avoiding carbon emissions across the last mile of our transportation network. We are committed to having at least 100,000 electric delivery vans—from Rivian and other manufacturers—on the road by 2030.

Jaya Varma Sinha, CEO of Indian Railways, spoke at the Smbhav Summit in 2023. Indian Railways’ partnership with Amazon India enables more sustainable modes of transportation and faster and more reliable delivery of customer packages in the region.

In 2023, we delivered more than 680 million packages globally using more than 24,000 electric delivery vehicles, including 19,000 electric delivery vans, around the world.

# United States

- Our U.S. fleet included 11,800 electric delivery vans from Rivian, up from more than 2,600 in 2022.
- We delivered 431 million packages via EVs.

# Europe

- We deployed more than 300 electric delivery vans from Rivian on the road in Europe as part of our broader fleet of more than 3,000 electric delivery vehicles.
- We delivered 150 million packages via EVs.

# India

- We nearly doubled the number of EVs in our Indian delivery fleet to more than 7,200, including 3,600 electric delivery vans, and more than 3,600 two-, three-, and four-wheel vehicles.
- We delivered 81 million packages via EVs.
- We installed charging infrastructure near more than 100 Amazon locations.

# Zero-Emission Deliveries in London

In August 2023, we began transporting packages in London using both zero-emission middle mile vehicles (electric heavy-duty trucks) and last mile vehicles (electric vans). While our current volumes of these vehicles are small, this pilot provides important learnings as we continue our work to decarbonize our transportation network.

# Reducing Emissions with Micromobility Delivery Solutions

Micromobility hubs are smaller, centrally located delivery stations. In dense cities, these hubs enable us to utilize non-traditional delivery methods, such as e-cargo bikes and on-foot deliveries, to bring packages to customers in ways that generate fewer carbon emissions.

# Last Mile Electric Delivery Vehicles by Region

|Region|2022|2023|
|---|---|---|
|U.S.|2,600|11,800|
|Europe|1,220|3,000+|
|India|3,800|7,200+|

# Customer Shipping Options to Avoid Carbon Emissions

We offer our customers shipping options that help reduce the carbon emissions associated with the delivery of their products. We also have programs for sellers to reduce delivery emissions and decrease costs.

# Amazon Day Delivery

Our Amazon Day shipping option allows Prime members to choose a designated day of the week to receive their orders. By consolidating orders into fewer packages and deliveries, we are avoiding emissions by saving boxes and reducing trips to individual addresses. In 2023, Amazon Day delivery avoided the use of more than 200 million boxes (up from nearly 115 million in 2022) and 226,000 metric tons of CO2 e.

# Ships in Product Packaging

Our Ships in Product Packaging program, formerly called Ships in Own Container, tests and certifies products that can ship safely in just their original manufacturers’ packaging—without an additional Amazon box, envelope, or bag. This minimizes the packaging materials used for delivery and allows packages to take up less space in delivery vehicles, increasing our truck fill rate.

# Building Construction and Operations

Our building portfolio comprises thousands of owned and leased facilities in more than 60 countries, including operations buildings, grocery stores, corporate offices, and data centers. The construction, operation, and decommissioning of these buildings accounted for one fifth of Amazon’s total carbon emissions in 2023, which is why we’re committed to implementing and scaling decarbonization solutions and processes to reduce the footprint of this sector of our business.

Carbon emissions connected to our buildings fall into two categories: embodied emissions and operational emissions. Embodied emissions in the buildings sector are generated from the manufacture, transportation, installation, maintenance, and disposal of building materials. Operational emissions refer to resources consumed by day-to-day processes needed to run our business, including computing, lighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, refrigeration systems, and operating other equipment.

Globally, our work to reduce carbon emissions related to our buildings focuses on:

- Implementing foundational efficiency initiatives: We are instituting and improving data collection practices to better track our performance and inform our efforts to improve efficiency and reduce energy use and carbon emissions across our buildings portfolio.
- Scaling renewable energy and lower-carbon approaches to heating and cooling: We use on-site renewables, such as rooftop solar installations on buildings we operate, as well as renewable energy from the grid to power our buildings. We’re also scaling up our use of refrigerants with low global warming potential (GWP) and utilizing alternative fuels as backup power sources and to cool data centers.
- Creating industry solutions to reduce embodied carbon: We collaborate with suppliers, industry partners, signatories of The Climate Pledge, and governing bodies to develop and implement standards, alternative materials, and solutions that address environmental challenges specific to the buildings sector.

# Sustainability at Our Second Headquarters

We want our corporate offices to be both inspiring places to work and models of what is possible when it comes to sustainable design and construction. We built our second headquarters (HQ2) in Arlington, Virginia, with sustainability in mind. Opened in May 2023, HQ2 runs on 100% renewable electricity and achieves energy savings of 24% relative to a comparable Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) baseline. In March 2024, it became the largest project (by building square footage) in the U.S. to receive LEED v4 Platinum certification.

Using an advanced lower-carbon concrete mix design that included CarbonCure, which we invested in through The Climate Pledge Fund, we achieved a 20% reduction in HQ2’s concrete structure carbon footprint compared to the industry baseline. This avoided 14,700 metric tons of CO2 emissions, which is the equivalent of taking 3,500 cars off the road in the U.S. for an entire year. More than 40 Amazon sites globally now use this same CarbonCure technology.

# Validating Our Progress

As teams across Amazon progress toward the decarbonization of our buildings, we’ve begun to validate our efforts using the International Living Future Institute’s Zero Carbon Certification (ZCC). This third-party certification program validates improvements to our building decarbonization efforts and provides clear accountability for our internal teams and external building partners. This rigorous, carbon-centric program requires us to provide actual measured—not predicted—performance over one year of building occupancy to assess credible carbon emission reductions. This means that we are just now receiving certifications for the first pilot projects we submitted for evaluation.

Amazon achieved two full certifications for building projects in 2023: an Amazon Fresh store in Seattle, Washington—which was the world’s first building of its type to achieve the certification—and a Same Day delivery station in Sacramento, California—the first-ever North American logistics building to be certified. We are working to scale alignment with this certification program throughout our company, with dozens of projects across our global buildings portfolio currently using ZCC standards to measure and validate our decarbonization efforts.

Design elements at HQ2 incorporate native flora and fauna and use earth tones and natural materials, such as wood and stone, to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.

# Scaling Renewable Energy and Lower-Carbon Approaches to Heating and Cooling

We are working to reduce the emissions associated with operating our buildings by using renewable energy and other lower-carbon alternatives.

For example, AWS is increasing the use of free-air cooling systems that cool servers with outside air. This avoids the need for energy-intensive compressor-based cooling systems throughout much of the year. Even during peak summer temperatures, data centers can utilize direct evaporative cooling, a process that uses water to cool the air and remove heat from servers.

# Scaling Renewable Energy

At the end of 2023, Amazon had 270 rooftop solar projects at our facilities around the globe. We brought 50 new on-site solar energy systems online in 2023, for a total capacity of 58 MW. These on-site solar energy systems are estimated to generate 123,000 MWh annually—enough energy to power over 33,600 European homes—and avoid the equivalent of roughly 47,400 metric tons of CO2e each year compared to nonrenewable electricity sources.

In 2023, AWS started transitioning to hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) to power backup generators at its data centers in the U.S. and Europe. HVO is a type of renewable diesel made from waste cooking oil or vegetable, plant, and residue oils. AWS sites in Ireland, Sweden, and Oregon were among the first to make the switch to HVO. Renewable diesel is readily available in regions such as the U.S. West and parts of Europe, but sourcing in areas such as the U.S. East and Midwest remains a challenge due to the lack of distribution terminals and established supply chains for this type of fuel.

# Lower-Emission Refrigerants

Refrigerants are cooling agents used in air conditioners, heat pumps, refrigerators, and freezers. Refrigerants with high GWP—such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—contribute to climate change by trapping more heat in the atmosphere than CO2. That’s why Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market use low-GWP refrigerants, such as CO2 refrigerants, to help grocery stores reduce emissions.

By the end of 2023, 46 Whole Foods Market stores were using low-GWP refrigeration systems. Whole Foods Market has also committed to using only low-GWP refrigeration systems in new stores in North America starting in 2025.

# Creating Industry Solutions to Reduce Embodied Carbon

Decarbonizing the buildings sector is a challenge no one company or organization can solve alone. We can, however, accelerate progress by engaging with industry partners to develop and scale innovations that reduce carbon emissions associated with the construction, operation, and decommissioning of buildings across sectors and markets.

# Using Lower-Carbon Materials

We are working to reduce embodied carbon in our infrastructure by increasing the use of lower-carbon materials in Amazon buildings, such as lower-carbon steel, lower-carbon concrete, and mass timber, a lower-carbon structural wood product that can replace concrete and steel in building construction.

# Servers and Hardware

As the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud provider, AWS is committed to building a lower-carbon business for its customers and the planet. AWS designs its data centers—including servers and hardware—for efficiency, resiliency, and a lower carbon footprint.

AWS’s scale allows for higher resource utilization and energy performance at the lowest cost per watt. Inferentia2 is up to 50% more energy-efficient and can reduce costs by up to 40% against comparable Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.

Meanwhile, AWS Graviton4 is the latest generation of chips designed by AWS and the most powerful and energy-efficient chip AWS has built as of 2023. Graviton4 provides up to 30% better computing performance, 50% more cores, and 75% more memory bandwidth than Graviton3 processors while being more energy efficient.

The AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure is built on AWS’s own custom hardware and optimized for workloads run by AWS customers. Research shows that in North America, AWS can lower its customers’ workload carbon footprints by up to 96% compared to on-premises computing workloads when the electricity AWS uses is matched with 100% renewable energy—a goal that Amazon, including AWS, achieved in 2023.

AWS is reducing emissions related to server use and networking equipment by increasing server lifespan. This includes refining software to run more efficiently, which lowers stress on hardware and extends the amount of time it can be used. In February 2024, AWS announced that the average expected life of its servers had improved from five to six years. To support these efforts, AWS has a robust maintenance and repair program in place that is designed to increase component reuse and further reduce carbon emissions and waste across its supply chain.

# Partnering to Reduce Carbon Emissions in the Semiconductor Industry

AWS knows that by collaborating across the entire semiconductor industry, it can drive carbon emission reductions at a scale greater than what is possible on its own. To that end, AWS is partnering with its suppliers to decrease their operational emissions and engage their own upstream supply chains to do the same. In 2023, AWS joined the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), an organization focused on reducing carbon emissions across the global semiconductor supply chain. The SCC collaboration accelerates decarbonization for member company operations and enables new solutions and approaches for adoption.

# Reducing Emissions from the Transportation of Data Center Hardware

In 2023, we worked with our top suppliers to develop carbon footprints for the products responsible for over half the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our private brands. These insights informed the creation of joint abatement plans, which help avoid future product emissions through actions including moving to recycled materials, using renewable energy to power manufacturing facilities, and reducing packaging.

- Increasing ocean freight: In 2023, AWS transported approximately 6,600 metric tons of hardware components on cargo ships, avoiding approximately 65,000 metric tons of CO2 by reducing airfreight in favor of ocean freight where possible.
- Investing in lower-carbon fuels: AWS is encouraging its suppliers to decarbonize long-haul transportation, including through the use of SAF. In 2023, AWS purchased over 6 million liters of SAF, which avoided approximately 15,600 metric tons of CO2 compared to conventional aviation fuel.
- Making ground deliveries using EVs: AWS is increasing the use of EVs for equipment-related ground deliveries. In Dublin and Singapore, for example, AWS worked with transportation providers to transport racks, loose gear, and other components to data center locations using electric trucks.

# Amazon Private Brands

Two of our private brands, Amazon Essentials and Amazon Basics, make products across many categories, including clothing, bedroom furniture and mattresses, kitchen appliances and cookware, toys, pet essentials, and workout gear. Amazon works with suppliers around the world to manufacture these products at a high quality and great value.

In 2023, AWS launched Inferentia2, the second generation of its Inferentia chip, developed to deliver the highest efficiency.

Amazon Grocery and Whole Foods Market teams are working with HowGood—an independent research company and data platform with the world’s largest database on food product sustainability—to measure and improve the impact of our food products across multiple categories, including carbon emissions, soil health, and water usage. HowGood measures the carbon footprint of our products based on each product’s ingredient breakdown, sourcing locations, and certifications, instead of using industry averages. This gives us a more accurate understanding of our carbon footprint, allowing us to identify emissions hotspots and prioritize abatement solutions with our suppliers.

Whole Foods Market also actively supports and finances renewable energy certificates in the U.S. and Guarantees of Origin in the EU, to signal our support for renewable energy in the grids where we operate, in line with the expected energy generation of the projects we’ve contracted. By the end of 2022, we had contracted enough renewable energy capacity through new wind and solar farms to equal the expected electricity used by all active Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices globally by 2025. Some of these wind and solar projects are operational today; others are currently under construction and expected to begin operating in 2024.

# Devices

Amazon’s sustainability strategy considers the entire lifecycle of our devices—from how we build them to how our customers use and retire them. We strive to make each generation of new Amazon devices more carbon- and energy-efficient and less resource-intensive than the last.

In 2023, we published the carbon footprint of newly launched Echo, eero, Ring, Fire TV, and Fire tablet devices on the product detail pages of our U.S. Amazon.com site, along with product sustainability fact sheets for each device. Fact sheets provide customers with a detailed breakdown of emissions throughout the device’s lifecycle, including those resulting from the extraction, production, and transportation of raw materials and device parts; the energy associated with device use; and end-of-life processing.

We also published the Amazon Devices Product Carbon Footprint Methodology to give customers insight into how we calculate the carbon footprint of our devices.

Many of our devices offer a Low Power Mode feature, which reduces energy consumption when the device is idle. Our latest Echo and Fire TV devices, for example, feature Low Power Mode, and we are delivering updates to introduce this feature in older devices already in use. By the end of 2023, over 67% of Echo devices and Fire TVs had Low Power Mode, up from over 60% in 2022.

# Engaging Suppliers

Our carbon neutralization approach focuses on three actions outside of our value chain. Based on climate science, we know that these areas have a significant unmet need for investment and can deliver critical mitigation benefits:

1. Reducing deforestation
2. Advancing the removal of carbon from the atmosphere with nature-based solutions
3. Scaling up carbon removal technologies

As we progress on our net-zero carbon emissions journey, Amazon is continuing to engage suppliers in the critical work of reducing their operational emissions and working with their own upstream supply chains to do the same. We have identified a list of the highest-emitting suppliers directly supporting our operations, and expect those suppliers, who collectively contribute more than 50% of emissions globally to Amazon’s Scope 3 footprint, to provide a plan for how they will decarbonize their operations and demonstrate real progress over time. We will prioritize our business toward those who provide their plans and results on their path to net-zero carbon emissions.

# Carbon Neutralization

Today’s carbon credit market is fragmented, complex, and opaque. At Amazon, we use the best available science to design and evaluate projects and measure, verify, and monitor carbon credits. We also use robust methodologies to verify that the projects we support do, in fact, neutralize carbon. In doing so, we are paving the way for a future where carbon credits are a quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial method by which to reduce and remove carbon from the atmosphere.

In 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Carbon Trust, which partners with businesses, governments, and organizations around the world to accelerate the transition to net-zero carbon emissions. We work with the Carbon Trust on technical specifications for decarbonizing the use phase of internet-connected devices. As part of this work, throughout 2023, we partnered with Samsung, Meta, Microsoft, and Comcast to develop standards that provide practical, meaningful steps for mitigating emissions at the customer use stage of the device lifecycle.

# Reducing Embodied Carbon

Reducing embodied carbon in our hardware requires us to decarbonize all parts of the device lifecycle, including manufacturing. We encourage Amazon device suppliers to reduce their manufacturing emissions, including by using renewable energy. As of the end of 2023, we’ve received commitments from 49 device suppliers to work with us on decarbonization, up from 28 suppliers in 2022. We also helped 21 suppliers develop renewable energy plans, including final assembly suppliers that make up over 70% of our direct manufacturing spend for Echo, Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Ring, Blink, and eero devices and accessories.

# ABACUS

As part of an independent working group made up of leading carbon market experts, scientists, and conservation professionals, we helped develop ABACUS, a rigorous set of principles and requirements for quantifying the climate benefits of restoration projects. ABACUS aims to quantify the complete set of climate impacts associated with restoration projects. One example of this is “leakage:” when a project designed to restore forests displaces production and leads to deforestation somewhere else. ABACUS requires projects to maintain or enhance agricultural production to avoid leakage. ABACUS also requires a data-driven dynamic baseline that compares carbon removal progress over time to control areas that are not restored.

# Lowering Emissions by Protecting Nature

We have made an ambitious pledge to protect nature and mitigate climate change through the Lowering Emissions by Protecting Nature initiative.

# Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition

A public-private initiative that is mobilizing more than $1 billion to protect the world’s tropical forests and surrounding communities by supporting government policies and programs that reduce emissions from deforestation at national or large sub-national scale.

Additionally, Amazon provided funding and technology to help the State of Pará, Brazil, institute traceability in the cattle sector, advance alternative livelihoods for family farmers, deter illegal land use by streamlining and digitizing proper land titling, and reclaim illegally deforested state lands. AWS is supporting the government of the State of Pará in designing and deploying SeloVerde (Green Seal), a cutting-edge AI tool to address climate change challenges and traceability in supply chains with a high risk of deforestation. SeloVerde combines government databases, innovative map services, and land-use data from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. This allows industry stakeholders access to information that helps them make environmentally responsive, data-based purchasing decisions for commodities such as cattle and soy.

# Scaling Up Carbon Removal Technologies

In 2023, we signed an agreement to support what is expected to be the world’s largest deployment of direct air capture (DAC). DAC is an emerging set of technologies that chemically scrub CO2 from the air. The captured CO2 is then stored deep underground or used in applications such as building materials (including concrete, brick, and cement) and low-carbon fuels. We committed to purchasing carbon dioxide removal credits equaling 250,000 metric tons of CO2 from 1PointFive, which is currently constructing its first DAC plant in Texas. When fully operational, the plant is expected to be the largest in the world, with capacity to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually.

# The Climate Pledge

The Climate Pledge is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge with Global Optimism in 2019 and was the first company to sign on. The Climate Pledge brings the world’s top companies together to drive joint action, cross-sector collaboration, and responsible change. Companies signing up to The Climate Pledge agree to the following three areas of action:

- Regular reporting: Measure and report GHG emissions on a regular basis.
- Carbon elimination: Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through business change and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emissions elimination strategies.
- Credible offsets: Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.

# The Climate Pledge by the Numbers

| |2021|2022|2023|YoY%|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Signatories|300|396|473|19%|
|Countries|29|36|42|17%|
|Industries|51|55|59|7%|

With 473 signatories, The Climate Pledge focused more on cross-industry collaboration in 2023 than ever before. In 2023, The Climate Pledge launched five joint action projects involving its signatories to accelerate progress to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Working together, signatories addressed tough problems in hard-to-abate sectors to promote technological innovation, send demand signals, address supply chain conundrums, and encourage the integration of climate justice business practices. So far, 24 signatories have joined The Climate Pledge projects related to lower-emission supply chain transportation solutions, circularity, increasing urban charging infrastructure, electrifying middle mile freight, and data transparency.

# Laneshift

Laneshift is one example of The Climate Pledge’s joint action projects. In 2023, The Climate Pledge and C40, a global network of nearly 100 mayors of the world’s leading cities, developed Laneshift to accelerate the transition to zero-emission electric trucks and charging infrastructure across major cities in India and Latin America. Laneshift is creating a roadmap for the freight industry to partner with rapidly urbanizing cities to utilize cleaner transportation solutions.

- Catalyzing the deployment of electric freight vehicles and corresponding infrastructure across cities in India (Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune) and Latin America.

In 2023, The Climate Pledge Fund made nine investments—including both new and follow-on investments for existing portfolio companies—bringing its total investment portfolio to 24 companies. The Climate Pledge Fund’s new investments covered a broad set of categories including packaging (Genecis Bioindustries), grocery and agriculture (Windfall Bio), and transportation (Forum Mobility). The Climate Pledge Fund also invested in a new category—carbon removal—through its support of CarbonCapture Inc.

This program is expected to reduce emissions, improve air quality, create green jobs, and work toward a just transition for workers. In 2023, Laneshift set up operations and initiated groundwork, including hiring staff and establishing global key performance indicators.

# Accelerating Climate Solutions from Female Founders

As part of The Climate Pledge Fund’s broader dedication to accelerate female-led climate solutions, in 2022, it committed at least $50 million to invest in female-founded and female-led climate technology companies. This investment includes the support of incubators and accelerators focused on women entrepreneurs and is designed to help address the gender equity funding gap that currently exists for women in climate technology.

In 2023, The Climate Pledge Fund invested in Genecis Bioindustries, a women-led climate tech company in the U.S. founded by scientist Luna Yu. Yu and her team are using specialized bacteria to turn organic waste—such as bread crusts and other food scraps—into bioplastic, a biodegradable and easily recyclable alternative to plastic packaging. Amazon is evaluating ways to use Genecis’s technology in our own business, such as to deliver grocery and consumer goods.

# Looking Forward

Reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 will be challenging. Achieving this ambitious goal will require a multifaceted approach that spans Amazon’s delivery and logistics networks; building construction and operations; servers and hardware; grocery, products, and devices; and packaging operations. We will continue working to reduce carbon emissions, including by expanding our use of carbon-free energy and switching to lower-carbon materials and fuels where possible.

Amazon also continues to support the Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains (Resilience Fund), created to support women’s economic resilience, health, and well-being. We know that we can make even greater progress when we collaborate with others, and we will continue to engage external partners—from expert coalitions to our diverse network of suppliers—to scale our efforts to decarbonize worldwide in the service of building a better future for all.

# Transitioning to carbon-free energy sources

Transitioning to carbon-free energy sources—which include renewable energy sources such as wind and solar as well as other sources such as nuclear power—is one of the most effective ways to lower Scope 2 emissions. It can also create real economic growth in communities where energy projects are built and operate, while helping advance the modernization and management of energy infrastructure. As our customers’ needs for computing power, products, and services grow, so does our demand for energy. That means we must diversify our energy portfolio with additional reliable carbon-free sources, so we remain on track to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Our goal to match 100% of the electricity consumed by our global operations with renewable energy by 2025 is a milestone that is now part of our broader carbon-free energy strategy.

Our Approach

We use broad carbon-free energy options to support our new utility-scale wind and solar projects. We also participate in green tariff programs with utilities and pursue new renewable projects through competitive site energy contracts. Renewable energy certificates in the U.S. and Guarantees of Origin in the EU help us bridge the gap between project inception and operation—when the project actually starts to power our buildings or feed renewable energy into the grid.

Carbon-free energy includes existing renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar farms and on-site rooftop solar systems, as well as nuclear reactors that generate carbon-free energy and other sources such as hydroelectric and geothermal. It also includes site energy contracts and green tariffs with local utilities that result in new wind and solar projects being added to the grid. There is not a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to transitioning to carbon-free energy, and we believe that all viable and scalable options should be considered.

Shifting to carbon-free energy requires a targeted, multifaceted approach. We are taking action to achieve our goals in the following ways:

- Energy efficiency: We innovate to continuously improve the energy efficiency of our operations and devices. We’re also improving data collection and analysis to better understand our operational energy requirements. This informs our carbon-free procurement decisions and energy optimization initiatives.
- Scaling renewable energy projects: We invest in on-site renewables through rooftop solar installations on buildings we operate, as well as in off-site renewables through power purchase agreements (PPAs) that fund new utility-scale wind and solar projects.
- Energy storage solutions: We are expanding battery energy storage capacity to support the decarbonization of electricity grids.
- Diversifying carbon-free energy sources: In addition to wind and solar, we are exploring and investing in other carbon-free energy sources, such as nuclear, that can help match the electricity consumed by our operations for the long term as our business grows.
- Partnerships and advocacy for carbon-free energy solutions: We engage in partnerships, industry initiatives, and public policy advocacy to advance access to and the expansion of carbon-free energy for Amazon, our customers, and the communities where we operate.

As part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, we set two renewable energy goals that are central to our broader carbon-free energy approach: to match all the electricity consumed by our operations with 100% renewable energy and to invest in wind and solar capacity equal to the electricity used by all active Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide. Additionally, we’re asking our suppliers to use more renewable energy, engaging product and device suppliers to set goals to decarbonize their own operations, and working with suppliers on initiatives to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

# Brownfield Solar Projects

There is an emerging opportunity to repurpose previously polluted, unused land to deliver economic and environmental benefits for local communities. Brownfields are pieces of land that have been abandoned due to pollution, such as mines, factories, and landfills. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that more than 450,000 brownfields could be revitalized for solar energy projects across the country. Brownfields are often located near power lines and public roads, making it easier to connect these types of projects to the grid.

The project is expected to employ more than 200 skilled workers during peak construction activities and provide millions of dollars in local tax revenue. Once completed, it is expected to be the largest solar farm in Maryland. Featuring more than 326,000 solar panels, Amazon Solar Farm Maryland–CPV Backbone will avoid more than 64,000 metric tons of CO2 each year—the equivalent of taking more than 13,900 cars off the road.

# Carbon-Free Energy Solutions

As the world’s largest corporate renewable energy purchaser, we have a unique role to play in supporting a more just, equitable, and sustainable clean energy transition. As a founding member and active participant in Beyond the Megawatt—an initiative from the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA)—we are helping scale results-oriented clean energy procurement strategies that put energy grid resiliency, social equity, and environmental protection at the forefront of solar and wind transactions.

# Advocating for Improved Infrastructure and Policies

We have made significant progress in procuring renewable energy for our business, supply chain, and surrounding communities. However, there are a number of challenges to scaling up renewables, including project delays, long timelines due to interconnection queues, and the lack of a strong policy framework.

# Supporting Grid Improvements

The widespread transition to carbon-free power requires an upgraded and expanded electricity grid. In the U.S., insufficient transmission capacity is gridlocking renewable energy deployment. The demand for renewables is overwhelming—projects waiting to get on the grid exceed the system’s overall capacity to support them. With a growing number of renewable projects in the pipeline, advancing policies and incentives to enable and encourage the much-needed build-out of the transmission system will be vital.

We recommended to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that it require transmission providers to consider a broader array of transmission needs, including corporate commitments for renewable energy procurement.

Planners to deploy grid-enhancing technologies. These technologies can unlock capacity for and improve efficiencies around renewable energy by reducing congestion on existing grid infrastructure. We are also working with a number of organizations, including PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator for the mid-Atlantic, and the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit working to transform the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future, to improve capacity on existing lines and bring renewable energy to the grid at a much lower cost than that of traditional solutions.

We continued our advocacy work with U.S. regulators in 2023 to improve transmission planning, permitting, and interconnection processes, including calling for federal transmission permitting reform in Congress. We also joined advocacy groups such as Western Freedom and Renewable Northwest in support of their efforts to create an organized wholesale electricity market in the western U.S. Amazon publicly supported and advocated for SB-410 (Powering Up Californians Act), a new law to speed up utility interconnection processes, which passed in the California legislature with bipartisan support and was signed into law by the governor.

Our advocacy to scale renewable energy extends around the globe. In Japan, Amazon worked with third-party organizations to advocate for virtual PPAs, allowing corporate buyers to increase the number of projects that will be built through their own initiatives. In South Africa, we partnered with the City of Cape Town to pilot a “power wheeling” project. Power wheeling uses the city’s transmission or distribution system to distribute energy between different grids or service areas. As a result of the pilot, energy customers in the city can now invest in and access renewable energy projects.

# Anticipating Future Energy Demand

Powered by AWS, AWS is collaborating with Duke Energy, which operates the largest electrical grid in the U.S., to build new smart grid software and services that anticipate future energy demand and identify where and how to update the power grid. By running on AWS, Duke Energy’s Intelligent Grid Services will provide more accurate forecasting of electricity needs in a matter of minutes, rather than the weeks it would take with traditional information technology hardware. This in turn enables Duke Energy to make smarter decisions, including about where to replace equipment or implement non-wire alternatives, which are electrical grid investments intended to defer or eliminate the need to construct or upgrade components.

Because permitting for renewable energy projects is one key factor delaying clean energy deployment, we are working with legislators, advocacy organizations, and corporate partners to drive permitting efficiencies across Europe and help reduce delays. In Poland, we called for policymakers to loosen restrictions on permitting and locating wind projects as its government works to increase the amount of renewable energy on its grid. As a result of our and others’ work, Poland’s government partially reduced its permitting restrictions in 2023, allowing more renewable energy projects to be developed there.

# Looking Forward

We remain focused on scaling carbon-free energy across our company and the communities we operate in. In 2024 and beyond, we will continue to add more carbon-free energy generation and storage capacity to our portfolio as we scale up new technologies such as AI and work toward our goal to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. This will include investing in more solar and wind energy projects, such as our Moray West offshore wind farm in Scotland, and nuclear projects.

As we progress toward decarbonizing our business, we will also engage with our partners, industry associations, and regulators around the world to scale our work, share what we’ve learned, and advocate for infrastructure and policies that help create a carbon-free energy future. We’ve always said that the path to net-zero carbon won’t be linear. As with any long-term goal, we’ll continue to evolve our strategy over time to do what is right for our business and the planet, to meet the needs of our customers, and to reach net-zero carbon by 2040.

Our Amazon Air Hub located at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport is home to Kentucky’s largest solar array, created in collaboration with Duke Energy.

# Our Approach

Amazon takes a science-based approach to packaging that combines lab testing, machine learning, materials science, and manufacturing partnerships to optimize our packaging. We think locally, taking into consideration factors such as location and geography, average delivery distance to customers, vehicle type, and delivery method. As we regionalize our network, products travel shorter distances to customers and need less protective packaging. We move quickly to invest in responsible shipping and packaging innovations that can scale our program to ship products without additional packaging.

# Our Progress

Many products can be shipped safely without protection from additional Amazon delivery bags or boxes, which is the main idea behind our Ships in Product Packaging program. Through this program, we deliver eligible items in the manufacturers’ original packaging without supplemental Amazon delivery packaging, allowing us to avoid unnecessary material use and reduce the weight of deliveries. Our aim is to continue to increase the number of products shipped without additional packaging.

# 2023 Delivery Packaging by Region

| | | |Region|Product Packaging|Corrugated|Flexibles|Boxes|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Around the World| | | |9%|47%|44%| |
|Europe| | | |13%|51%|36%| |
| | |U.S. and Canada| |19%|38%|43%| |
| | | |India|3%|19%|8%| |
| | |Japan| | | | | |
| | |Brazil, Mexico, and Singapore| | | | | |

In 2023, nearly 12 million products qualified for the Ships in Product Packaging program, and 12% of Amazon packages globally were shipped without additional packaging, including 13% in the U.S. and Canada, 9% in Europe, 3% in Japan, 19% in India, and 8% in Brazil, Mexico, and Singapore. This progress is a result of continuing to identify products that qualify for the program, working with selling partners to make packaging updates that allow their products to ship in their original packaging, and implementing regionalization. The last is Amazon’s new delivery approach that utilizes shorter routes across the U.S., expanding eligibility for products to ship in their own packaging without risking damage.

# Inspiring Selling Partners to Reduce Packaging

Our Ships in Product Packaging program doesn’t just offer environmental benefits. Less packaging also means lower costs, and Amazon believes in sharing these cost savings with our selling partners. In 2023, we tested decreasing the cost of Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) for sellers who adopt the program. In early 2024, we expanded this fee reduction to all FBA sellers with eligible products. The program is available to sellers in seven marketplaces: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the U.S.

Amazon works with companies such as Windex to help re-engineer their packaging to qualify for the Ships in Product Packaging program.

# Optimizing with Lighter, More Flexible, and Right-Sized Packaging

We aim to increase the number of products that ship in the manufacturers’ original packaging without additional packaging, as well as select lighter, right-sized options to reduce our packaging footprint. We strive to keep our packaging lightweight and minimal while ensuring deliveries reach customers without damage. Lighter, more flexible, and right-sized packaging helps reduce delivery emissions per package by using less material and taking up less space in delivery vehicles. Since 2015, we have decreased our average per-shipment packaging weight by 43%, which represents more than 3 million metric tons of packaging materials avoided.

When possible, Amazon uses lightweight packaging by prioritizing flexible paper bags and envelopes. In the U.S., these flexible options are up to 89% lighter than similar-sized rigid corrugated boxes. With millions of products and an infinite number of order combinations, identifying the optimal packaging solution to keep each order safe during transit represents a significant challenge. That is why we use machine learning algorithms to determine the most efficient option for each order we fulfill.

|Ships in Product Packaging|Flexible Packaging Padded|Flexible Packaging Unpadded|Corrugated Boxes|
|---|---|---|---|
|2023|12%|50%|38%|
|2022|11%|49%|40%|
|2021|8%|49%|43%|

Data represents shipments from the Amazon fulfillment network fulfilled through Amazon-owned and -operated fulfillment centers across Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the U.S.

Machine learning algorithms also help us determine the best fit for orders with multiple items, so we can decrease empty space in boxes. Optimized shipments require less space in the vehicles that deliver packages to our customers, helping reduce the number of vehicles on the road.

Another way Amazon uses machine learning is to optimize the suite of cardboard box options at any one facility. Our web-based tools help identify and select a facility’s suite of shipping box types based on the order patterns unique to that facility.

# Phasing Out Single-Use Plastics

from delivery packaging in North America, working toward full removal by end of year. This will avoid the use of nearly 15 billion plastic air pillows annually and will be our largest plastic packaging reduction effort in North America to date. We will continue to build and test new innovations and improve on the systems we have in place in order to decrease our use of single-use plastic packaging and share updates on the progress we’re making.

# 2023 Packaging Use by Region

|Region|Average Packaging Weight per Shipment (g/shipment)|Metric Tons of Packaging Eliminated|Single-Use Plastic Packaging Used in Region (MT)|Avoided since 2020 (MT)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Europe|96|34,817|877|14,600|
|U.S. and Canada|111|33,529|83,513|41,600|
|India|112|9,910|1,015|9,100|
|Japan| | |931|13,400|
|Rest of World| |2,362| |1,800|
|Total| |88,698| |80,500|

These packaging reduction initiatives have made a significant impact, decreasing our average plastic packaging weight per shipment by 9% across Amazon’s global operations network, building on a 17% reduction in 2022. Altogether, we have avoided 80,500 metric tons of single-use plastic packaging since 2020. Efforts so far include our Ships in Product Packaging program, leveraging AI to identify where we can use lighter, more flexible, right-sized packaging, replacing single-use plastic delivery packaging with 100% household-recyclable paper and cardboard packaging in our fulfillment network in Europe, and eliminating single-use, thin-film plastic packaging from our fulfillment network in India.

In Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, Amazon stopped using dunnage, including air pillows, in most boxes. When we do still need to use dunnage to secure products during shipping, we’re increasing our use of packaging made with recycled materials. For larger shipments that require dunnage, we are working toward replacing air pillows with paper alternatives.

In Japan, 99.5% of delivery packaging material is household recyclable as of the end of 2023. We anticipate that all sites in this country will participate in this program by the end of 2024. In 2023, Amazon removed plastic shrink-wrap film and replaced plastic cushioning materials, such as air pillows.

With paper-based dunnage in Japan, except when packaging fragile items and gift packages. We are also in the process of switching from plastic packaging tape to paper tape.

Since 2021, Amazon has utilized automated paper-bag packaging machines in Japan to optimize packaging size and material use and increase household recyclability. We expanded this practice to Australia in 2023.

# Minimizing and Optimizing Packaging in Grocery

To make sure groceries ordered from Amazon and Whole Foods Market arrive in good condition, we look for ways to protect products during delivery while still minimizing our packaging footprint.

In 2023, Amazon Fresh reduced our use of insulation packaging material, which avoided approximately 1,180 metric tons of packaging. Similarly, Whole Foods Market avoided 1,300 metric tons of packaging by using daily variable insulation, a practice that tracks and adjusts the amount of insulation packaging used in deliveries in North America to ensure it is used only when temperatures exceed a specific threshold.

Groceries are also being delivered in packaging that is easier to recycle. In 2023, the grocery delivery packaging used by Amazon Fresh was 88% recyclable by weight.

In 2023, Whole Foods Market published an updated version of its Packaging Guidelines to help merchants, procurement teams, and suppliers understand how to make more sustainable choices for product packaging. In alignment with the Whole Foods Market Sustainability Strategy, these guidelines are meant to reduce the amount of packaging it uses, improve the source material, and design for end-of-life and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

# Device Packaging

Amazon’s strategy to optimize and increase the recyclability of packaging extends to our devices. In 2020, we set an ambitious goal to make our device packaging 100% recyclable by 2023—a first for the consumer electronics industry. To work toward this goal, we collaborated with our suppliers to develop paper-based wraps and films that protect devices and are compatible with paper recycling streams. These paper-based wraps are recyclable in the U.S. where recycling programs are available.

In 2023, 90% of our new devices and accessories launched with packaging that is 100% recyclable in the U.S., up from 79% in 2022. We have made significant progress, but we have not yet created recyclable packaging for heavier items, such as Fire TVs. The box for Fire TVs is recyclable, but we still include foam cushioning and bags to protect the device when it is shipped, and these are not yet recyclable. Amazon remains committed to using recyclable device packaging and to inventing recyclable solutions for heavier items, such as Fire TVs, that properly protect the device while maintaining our high bar for quality.

# Looking Forward

We remain committed to enhancing our packaging for both performance and sustainability. We will continue working to reduce our packaging footprint by increasing uptake of the Ships in Product Packaging program, leveraging machine learning and other innovative technologies to optimize packaging size and shape, and transitioning to more circular packaging materials instead of single-use plastics. In fact, in February 2024, we announced that nearly 50% of customer orders from our India fulfillment network now come with reduced or no added packaging.

# Partnerships to Improve Packaging Materials, Circularity, and Recycling

Amazon works hard to reduce plastic packaging across our deliveries. However, in some cases, the right technologies and materials do not yet exist to adequately protect orders from physical damage or in specific weather conditions. To find alternatives that are waterproof, flexible, and safe enough for e-commerce deliveries and product packaging, our partnerships are crucial.

In 2022, we became a member of the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO), a nonprofit group leading the development of a circular economy for packaging in Australia. Along with setting the country’s 2025 national packaging targets, APCO works to foster a collaborative packaging value chain in Australia.

# Waste and Circularity

# Goal

Reduce food waste by 50% across U.S. and Europe operations by 2030.

# Metrics

|75%|Reduction in food waste intensity—a measure of food waste as a percentage of total food handled by weight—in Europe operations compared to a 2021 baseline.|
|---|---|
|28%|Reduction in food waste intensity in U.S. operations compared to a 2021 baseline.|

Around the world, natural resource extraction and waste generation have grown significantly. In the last six years alone, the global economy consumed over half a trillion tons of materials—nearly as much as the materials consumed throughout the entire 20th century. As resources continue to be extracted, it is imperative for businesses to do all they can to prevent and reduce waste. At Amazon, we strive to be a responsible steward of our planet’s finite resources. We know that contributing to a circular economy will help mitigate the effects of climate change, reduce biodiversity loss, and alleviate other global challenges by decoupling economic activity from resource consumption. With this in mind, we are working to increase what we resell, reuse, and recycle across our business and to reduce what we ultimately send to landfills.

# Our Approach

Our waste hierarchy sets out our guiding principles for preventing, managing, and reducing waste. Amazon has programs in place to optimize our inventory, reduce food surplus, and source materials that help us prevent waste in the first place. Where possible, we look for ways to reduce, reuse, recycle, or compost these materials.

# Our Approach to Managing and Preventing Waste

This hierarchy is an industry framework that guides our approach to managing and preventing waste. It moves from the most preferred option at the top to the least preferred at the bottom. Materials in this hierarchy may be recycled, reclaimed, or otherwise reused in some way and thus may not end up as waste in landfills. We use this framework to better manage our waste, pursuing opportunities that are more preferred before moving down the hierarchy.

# Prevent

We improve product and packaging design, inventory management, materials sourcing, and resource use to prevent waste from the start.

# Reduce

We pursue avenues such as increased product durability and resale to reduce waste. We also work to prevent waste generation by helping customers make informed decisions, which reduces product returns, and offer several ways for them to support product circularity.

# Reuse

We repair, repurpose, and donate usable items where possible.

We amplify our efforts by considering how customers use our products through end-of-life and by providing them with opportunities to repair or resell products. Our circular approach keeps valuable resources in use longer, avoiding waste and reducing related effects such as carbon emissions and pollution.

We know that avoiding waste is an ongoing process and that we cannot do it on our own. We engage with suppliers to reduce waste related to our products, partner with other organizations to scale our efforts to transition to a more circular economy, and work with local municipalities to improve recycling infrastructure where we can.

# Recycle

We recycle and compost to recover raw materials where possible, including food waste.

# Incineration with Energy Recovery

Where prevention, reduction, reuse, or recycling are not possible, we target energy recovery.

# Landfill and Incineration without Energy Recovery

Both landfill and incineration without energy recovery are disposal methods strictly used as a last resort for waste that is either ineligible for or cannot be diverted to better recovery pathways.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Our Progress

# Preventing and Managing Waste

Our external (indirect) waste footprint includes the following areas:

The waste we generate falls into two categories: internal and external. Internal waste is generated inside our operations, while external waste is generated both upstream and downstream of our operations, such as by suppliers and customers. Some of these items are diverted from waste streams by our prevention efforts, recycling programs, and other initiatives to reduce waste.

# Internal (Direct) Waste Footprint Includes:

- Operations: Operational waste is the type of waste that we can most directly control. We manage operational waste generated across our business, including from our grocery stores and other retail sites, customer fulfillment operations, office buildings, and data centers.
- Inventory Waste: Includes heavily damaged and unsold items, customer returns that cannot be resold, donated, or recycled, and food that is no longer safe for consumption.
- Noninventory Waste: Made up of resources that are used and discarded within our businesses. These materials enable our operations but are not directly part of the inventory of finished goods or materials used to produce them. Noninventory waste includes materials such as used cardboard boxes, shrink wrap, electronic waste, break room waste, used office furniture, and damaged storage equipment.

# External Waste Footprint Includes:

- Customer Waste: Generated during product use or in the form of product and delivery packaging, including when disposed of. Beyond the work we do to help customers keep items in use longer, we also offer several ways for them to support product circularity and prevent waste through our Amazon Second Chance program.
- Construction Waste: Comes from activities related to building our facilities. This consists mainly of commingled construction and demolition waste such as metals, masonry, asphalt, and drywall.
- Supply Chain Waste: Generated by third-party suppliers who manufacture products for, and provide goods and services to, our company.

# Food Waste

In the U.S., nearly 98% of Amazon’s food handled goes to human and animal consumption, and in Europe, more than 99% does. While these figures are encouraging, we are always exploring new ways to reduce food loss and waste as we work toward our goal to reduce our food waste by 50% across our U.S. and Europe operations by 2030.

Where food waste is not preventable, we are working to keep it out of landfills. As of the end of 2023, 62 Amazon Fresh stores in the U.S. and Europe divert food waste to organic recycling services, including those that support composting or anaerobic digestion. In 2023, 452 Whole Foods Market locations had active organics diversion programs, which diverted over 87,000 tons of food waste from landfill.

We also advocate for policies that would help prevent usable food from being wasted. In 2023, Amazon and Whole Foods Market supported the U.S. Food Date Labeling Act because confusion around food expiration date labeling can result in usable food being unnecessarily thrown out.

To reduce food waste, we are improving our management and distribution channels and buying practices to minimize surplus food inventory. In 2023, we enhanced buying and forecasting tools to help us predict and plan for the future.

# Second Chance Store

In November 2023, we opened a pop-up Second Chance Store in London, where customers could shop second-hand products from Amazon.

As we continue on our journey to reduce waste—including our commitment to reduce food waste by 50% in our U.S. and Europe operations by 2030—we are exploring different ways to learn and grow. As of the end of 2023, four Amazon Fresh facilities had achieved UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill certification at Silver or Gold level.

We secured this certification by improving operational waste sorting processes, standardizing recycling practices at all sites, introducing new associate trainings, and establishing new diversion pathways, including for food waste. Through the certification process, we learned new ways of working and identified potential opportunities for Amazon. We are excited to leverage what we have learned to improve our overall waste footprint.

# Reducing and Managing Inventory and Customer Waste

When it comes to product inventory, our priority is to prevent waste, both by helping customers make more informed shopping decisions—which helps reduce customer returns—and by reducing the number of products damaged in handling.

# Prevent

Amazon’s PLS program offered three free post-purchase care options: original equipment manufacturer (OEM) support and OEM repair, where customers can go straight to the manufacturer for support; Self Service, which helps customers address issues themselves; and parts replacement, where customers can request available components to replace damaged or missing parts, free of charge. In 2023, the PLS program helped avoid the return of more than 11 million items in the U.S. and Europe, up 50% from 2022.

Amazon Private Brands also launched a spare parts and repair program in Europe in 2023. We have learned that customers are more likely to keep an apparel item when a size is recommended for them. That is why we developed a deep learning-based algorithm to recommend, in real time, the best-fitting size for a customer. In 2023, our size recommendation system analyzed over 500 million data points every day and generated nearly 3 billion size recommendations each month for millions of customers across 19 countries around the world, including the U.S., India, and the UK.

# Reducing damage

We work hard to ensure our customers do not receive products that have been damaged in handling or during transportation. In 2023, we established a specialized team to analyze instances of damage across our global warehouse operations. Analyzing this data at a global level identified opportunities to implement technology and process changes to reduce damages. The resulting global warehouse damage-reduction plan led to a 21% decrease in damage intensity (how many products are damaged for every product we handle) worldwide in 2023.

# Reducing customer returns

We want our customers to be able to use the product they ordered with the quality level they expect. Our Product Lifecycle Support (PLS) program provides support options for customers to get the most out of their purchase for eligible products.

# Repair and resell

We carefully inspect and evaluate all returned and undelivered items at our Amazon return centers. If returned items meet Amazon’s high bar for sale as new, we re-list them. For items that are not eligible for re-listing as new but meet Amazon’s standards to be sold as used, we (or our specialized repair vendors) test, clean, repair, and repackage them prior to re-listing the item for sale. We continue to expand our repair capabilities, repairing 24% more products worldwide in 2023 than in 2022.

# ReCommerce for Amazon sellers

When returned items are not eligible for resale as new or used, those items are returned to sellers, liquidated, donated, or recycled. ReCommerce is the selling of previously owned items to buyers who reuse, recycle, or resell them. We provide ReCommerce services to Amazon sellers by grading their returned items and enabling recovery through programs such as grade and resell, liquidation, or donation. In 2023, we helped sellers resell, liquidate, or donate nearly 368 million of their items in the U.S. and Europe, a 42% increase compared to 2022.

# Donation

We donate items that are safe to use but remain in our inventory after we try to reuse, resell, or repair them. In 2023, we donated or helped our sellers donate over 162 million items worldwide.

# Recycle

Inventory that is not resold or donated may still be used, reused, or reclaimed through our inventory recycling program. We leverage existing recycling streams where possible and work closely with recycling partners to find.

AWS embraces circular economy principles for its server racks by designing reusable and lower-carbon rack systems from the outset. In addition, AWS works to keep equipment operating efficiently and to recover value from securely decommissioned equipment through reuse, repair, and recycling. By working to maximize resource value for as long as possible, AWS reduces waste generation from its global operations, decreases the use of raw materials, and reduces carbon emissions across its supply chain.

If a customer’s device is not eligible for our Amazon Trade-In program, the Amazon Recycling Program provides the customer with a shipping label to send their device to be recycled and safely disposed of at a licensed recycling facility.

# Reducing and Managing Noninventory Waste

Noninventory waste is made up of the materials we use to run our businesses, including cardboard packaging, shipping pallets, plastic stretch film, and paper labels. Our goal is to segregate these materials as much as possible so they can be more easily recycled. Cardboard is one of our largest noninventory waste streams, so we work closely with third-party recycling partners, including the companies that we source our cardboard packaging from, to recycle these materials.

In 2023, we:

- Improved our ability to collect and consolidate waste data from our vendors. This gives us a better understanding of our footprint and has allowed us to identify opportunities to increase waste diversion rates across our complex business.
- Increased our rate of operational waste diverted from disposal, placing emphasis on recycling and composting.
- Expanded our recycling efforts to include hard-to-recycle materials such as adhesive label backing, bulk cargo bags, and even personal protective equipment (such as masks and gloves).
- Replaced single-use cardboard shipping containers with reusable outbound carts to reduce cardboard waste at certain sites.

# Design Better

For its server racks, AWS concentrates on avoiding excess material such as steel or plastic, increasing recycled and bio-based content, and planning for repair, reuse, and recycling from the beginning. AWS has worked with suppliers to require that plastic parts of server racks launched since July 2023 contain at least 30% recycled or bio-based plastic. In 2023, AWS began to transition to plastic containing recycled and bio-based content in parts including air ducts, power distribution board covers, card holders, solid state drive (SSD) carriers/cages, riser brackets, latches, and trays. The carbon footprint of these plastic parts is up to 14% lower than that of older platforms with only virgin content. AWS is also working to use steel from electric arc furnaces, which use scrap steel in rack enclosures, increasing the recycled content from 10% to 90%.

# Operate Longer

When AWS uses equipment for as long as operationally efficient, it reduces the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing and using new hardware and avoids unnecessary waste. In February 2024, AWS announced that the average expected server lifetime had improved from five to six years. AWS also successfully completed a proof of concept that extends the lifespan of S3 hard disk drives (HDDs) by up to two years. This program consolidates individual functional drives from multiple aging racks into fewer, fully functional racks.

# AWS Hard Drive Consolidation

|Broken drives are identified and sent|Functioning drives are consolidated|
|---|---|
|1 to recycling.|2 into fewer racks, which prevents waste generation and displaces energy and materials use with new drives.|

# Recover More

When it is time for server racks to be decommissioned, AWS removes all customer data through secure and thorough sanitation processes. AWS then sends retired infrastructure hardware from around the world to its regional reverse logistics hubs. These hubs help AWS consolidate, assess, repair, and recirculate functional equipment back into its operations.

# Construction and Demolition Waste

To reduce construction and demolition waste from building projects, we leverage our design standards to optimize the amount of building materials we need. Where possible, we work with third-party recycling partners to recycle these materials.

Reducing waste across Amazon is an ongoing journey. We will strive to advance our work across our waste hierarchy to prevent waste, and we’ll continue scaling waste reduction and product circularity programs. Doing so in a manner that can keep up with the pace at which resource use is growing will require adopting new technologies that enable us to make progress more quickly and at a larger scale.

The construction project to build our second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, which opened in 2023, diverted 82% of all construction waste (over 17,000 tons) from landfills, including concrete, drywall, metals, wood, cardboard, and plastic.

We also leverage contractual agreements to help ensure contractors manage construction waste in accordance with both Amazon’s high standards and external legal requirements.

As part of our collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network, which is dedicated to creating a circular economy, we work to leverage our reach, technology, and innovation capabilities and the foundation’s subject-matter expertise to launch and scale circular economy solutions. This collaboration focuses on certifications for products with circular features, providing customers with the information they need to make more circular choices. These certifications will also encourage brands, OEMs, suppliers, retailers, and e-commerce platforms to create products that are designed in accordance with circular economy principles.

# Supply Chain Waste

Amazon works with suppliers to reduce waste related to the manufacture of our devices. For example, our devices teams engage suppliers to decrease waste and material use as part of our work to encourage more efficient manufacturing. As of 2023, 42 supplier sites of Amazon devices had achieved UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill certification at Silver or better, an increase from 10 supplier sites when we first launched the program in 2021. All final assembly sites worldwide and all China-based packaging sites for Echo, Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV devices, cables, and adapters have also secured Zero Waste to Landfill certification at Silver or better.

# Partnering for Circularity

We cannot solve all the challenges that underpin the broader shift to a circular economy alone, so we are working with multiple industry partners to innovate and bring about change at scale. In 2023, we expanded our collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to drive scalable, industry-wide solutions for a circular economy. As a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, we work to leverage our reach, technology, and innovation capabilities.

# Advocating for Waste Shipment Efficiency

In 2023, we co-led an industry effort to streamline and modernize waste shipment procedures, so that waste materials reach destinations with the best possible sustainability outcomes, including increased and more efficient recovery of critical raw materials. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal requires the origin country, any transit countries, and the destination country to approve certain shipments of waste. This process, known as prior informed consent (PIC), can be complex, time-consuming, and burdensome for under-resourced governments.

We are also excited to collaborate with Glacier on a pilot project to sort novel biomaterials, which would enable recycling for materials that currently cannot be reused.

The Climate Pledge Fund invested in Glacier, a company using AI-powered robots to automate the sorting of recyclables and collect real-time data on recycling streams. This technology helps recycling centers sort materials more effectively so that recyclable items stay out of landfills.

Of the way toward meeting its water positive goal

More than 2 billion people around the globe do not have access to safe drinking water, and roughly half the world’s population experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, due to climate change, population growth, and economic development.23

Amazon knows that responsible water management practices can mitigate water stress, which is a risk to not only our employees, customers, and communities, but also our business. We are committed to doing our part to help solve this rapidly growing challenge in the communities where we operate, as investment in local water resources is known to improve health, empower women, enable access to education, increase family income, and improve overall quality of life. To foster a more sustainable and resilient future, we are reducing our water footprint by conserving and reusing water across our on-site operations and throughout our communities. We’re also working with nonprofit and public partners to increase fresh water availability in water-scarce regions.

In Northern Virginia, AWS collaborates with Stroud Water Research Center on stream-friendly projects that increase groundwater recharge and deliver better-protected water resources to more people in the Chesapeake Bay area.

# Our Approach

We take a proactive approach to water stewardship, analyzing our footprint, driving operational resilience, and building more efficient systems that reduce our impact on local water sources. Our global water use includes water used in both our direct operations and wider supply chain.

Within our direct operations, we use water in the following ways:

- AWS data centers: Water is an essential resource for AWS. AWS primarily uses it to cool its global data centers, which give customers continuous access to AWS technologies. As a leader in water use effectiveness (WUE) among cloud providers, AWS aims to do its part to help solve water scarcity challenges. That is why it has set a goal to become water positive by 2030, meaning it will return more water to communities and the environment than its direct operations use. Through this goal, AWS is focused on reducing overall water withdrawal and replenishing water in basins facing water scarcity located in communities around data centers.
- Water use and replenishment across Amazon: For other water-intensive Amazon facilities, including logistics, grocery, and corporate office sites, we concentrate abatement efforts on regions with the highest risk of water scarcity based on their climates and watershed conditions. Our logistics buildings (fulfillment centers, sort centers, and delivery stations) and corporate offices use water in break rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and for landscape irrigation. Our grocery stores (Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market) also use water for these purposes, as well as to cook, clean, and defrost food; in water refill stations; and as ice in product displays.

# Our Progress

We track our progress by measuring and analyzing our direct operational water footprint. Since our different businesses use water in different ways, and water risk varies significantly across geographies, the aim of our data insights is to design a water program that we can tailor to specific needs across our company. This enables us to better forecast future water demand, determine the best ways to conserve water, and create more efficient systems that will benefit local watersheds over time.

# Water Positive in Data Centers

In 2022, AWS announced its commitment to being water positive by 2030. To meet this goal, AWS is delivering on four strategies:

- Water use effectiveness: AWS is continually working to optimize its water consumption and aims to improve its overall WUE by reducing how much incoming water it uses. AWS uses cloud technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) to analyze real-time water use and identify leaks.
- Using more sustainable sources: AWS strives to use sustainable water sources, such as recycled water and harvested rainwater, where possible. Using recycled water for data center cooling preserves valuable drinking water for communities.
- Reusing cooling water in communities: Data centers use non-contact cooling water to keep our servers from overheating. AWS finds ways to return the water to the community, including conveying the water to third parties for use in irrigation.
- Delivering water replenishment: AWS invests in water replenishment projects in the communities where it operates. These projects expand community water access, availability, and quality by restoring watersheds and bringing clean water, sanitation, and hygiene services to water-stressed communities.

In 2023, AWS used its water footprint analysis to inform where and how it can use more sustainable water sources (including recycled water and harvested rainwater), improve WUE, expand water reuse, and grow water replenishment investments.

# Water Risk Assessment

In 2023, Amazon conducted an in-depth, site-level global water risk assessment of our retail, operations, and corporate buildings to determine which regions to prioritize for intervention. We ranked regions by looking at their intrinsic water scarcity based on hazards such as water stress, groundwater table decline, and variability of water supply. Additionally, we examined the exposure and vulnerability of our operations and communities to those hazards, looking at factors such as the density and occupancy of our sites, amount of fresh water we withdraw, social vulnerability of local populations, and general ability of our operations to adapt to water shortage events. We used this assessment to build a water risk dashboard, which enables us to identify priority regions and sites for water stewardship projects.

# Water Use Effectiveness

AWS minimizes water use by using real-time data to identify leaks, piloting new treatment technologies, and exploring a range of operational changes, such as installing sensors and alerts to track water use and detect anomalies. Global teams deploy water monitoring technology in AWS data centers to determine where they need to take action to maintain or improve WUE. In 2023, AWS installed thousands of sensors in its data centers to track water use. Automatic alerts inform AWS of any anomalies so that operators can investigate in near-real time. AWS also invested in on-site water treatment systems that remove scale-forming minerals and allow AWS to recycle more water on-site and minimize the water consumed for cooling.

At the end of 2023, AWS was 41% of the way toward achieving its water positive goal. AWS measures progress against this goal annually by adding together reused water and water from replenishment projects and dividing that number by total water withdrawal minus water from sustainable sources.

# Water

AWS’s industry-leading global data center WUE improved to 0.18 liters of water per kilowatt-hour (L/kWh) in 2023 from 0.19 L/kWh in 2022—a 5% improvement year over year and a 28% improvement since 2021.

# AWS Water Use Effectiveness

| |2021|2022|2023|YoY%|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Water use effectiveness (L/kWh)|0.25|0.19|0.18|-5%|

AWS finds ways to fix leaks and gain other efficiencies. AWS returns used non-contact cooling water to the community, including conveying the water to third parties to use in growing crops such as alfalfa, soybeans, and wheat. For example, loans have helped communities finance water pipe connections and toilet installations in homes. Altogether, AWS’s investments in Water.org and WaterAid initiatives have benefited 290,000 people.

# Delivering Water Replenishment

By the end of 2023, AWS had invested in 15 water replenishment activities, returning water to the communities where it operates across 12 of our global infrastructure regions. These investments have expanded AWS replenishment activities to three new countries, bringing the total to 10: Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Ireland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the U.S. These activities help recharge groundwater, build wetlands, improve water quality, and reduce water loss in utility systems. In 2023, AWS’s water replenishment portfolio returned 3.5 billion liters to local communities.

# Using More Sustainable Sources

Recycled water typically has limited uses, including irrigation and industrial use. AWS uses recycled water for cooling, which helps preserve drinking water for local communities. In 2023, AWS increased the number of data centers using recycled water for cooling from 20 to 24, including two data centers in Virginia, one in California, and one in Singapore.

AWS has additionally begun harvesting rainwater as a sustainable water source. Using rainwater minimizes demands on community water resources and reduces potential surface water pollution from stormwater runoff. In Brazil, two of its data centers collect rainwater, reducing how much potable water AWS needs for cooling.

# Reusing Cooling Water in Communities

AWS data centers circulate water through their cooling systems as many times as possible, but eventually it needs to be replaced with new water. While spent water can no longer be used for cooling, it may be used for other purposes, such as irrigation. AWS is using advanced cloud services, such as IoT technologies, to analyze real-time water use, identify leaks, and reduce water loss.

# Tackling Water Leaks in Spain

Spain is considered one of the most water-stressed industrialized countries in the world. It has experienced long-term drought since 2022, driven in part by water loss from aging infrastructure. To help address this, AWS worked with the Washington Water Trust to support a drought relief program that enhances stream flows to help ensure healthy salmon runs in the Dungeness River in Washington state’s Olympic Peninsula.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Water Use and Replenishment

In addition to moving toward our water positive goal for AWS, Amazon is scaling best practices for water stewardship across our business more broadly. We strive to reduce water use in our operations, which include logistics sites such as fulfillment centers, as well as in our corporate offices and grocery stores.

Across our global logistics network, our teams actively look for ways to conserve and reuse water. In 2023, we gathered robust data to analyze how much water our facilities use and created a baseline for our water footprint to track progress going forward. We leveraged our water risk dashboard to monitor water hazards and water-related business risks to prioritize improvements. To inform the investments we make in water infrastructure, we also performed cost-benefit analyses for an array of water conservation, reuse, and harvesting projects.

Across the Middle East and Africa, we installed low-flow fixtures at our facilities. Our operations there additionally saved an estimated 3,700 cubic meters of water by installing aerators in faucets, shifting from conventional to sensor faucets, reducing toilet flush tank capacity, and recirculating water used in fire pump testing rather than draining it. In North America, we added faucet aerators in 90% of our fulfillment centers, sort centers, and grocery logistics sites.

In Japan, we added rainwater harvesting as a criterion for built-to-standard fulfillment centers, which will become standard for buildings opening after 2025. We expect to finish building the first fulfillment center with this infrastructure in late 2024, with an official launch in July 2025. By harvesting rainwater, we estimate that this site will reduce its water withdrawal by up to 40%.

Our corporate offices increased water recycling and the use of low-flow fixtures in 2023. This work is part of our efforts to set new standards for design as we strive to reduce indoor water use by more than 30% globally versus a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) baseline. Our offices in India and China, for example, replaced existing water flow fixtures in bathrooms and utilities areas with low-flow fixtures, reducing water use by 16%, or more than 15.6 million gallons, compared to a 2022 baseline.

To build on progress made in 2023, we will continue to analyze our water footprint and water risk assessment in both our direct operations and supply chain, as well as develop a comprehensive water management strategy tailored to unique geographic and business unit needs. AWS will focus on making ongoing progress toward its water positive goal, investing in efforts to restore watersheds and increase access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for people who need it most.

In 2022, Amazon announced a partnership with Water.org to help launch the Water.org Water & Climate Fund, which focuses on climate-resilient water and sanitation solutions. Amazon’s $10 million contribution will directly empower 1 million people with access to clean water by 2025, providing 3 billion liters of water per year to areas facing water scarcity.

As part of Amazon’s Water.org Water & Climate Fund work, more than 400,000 people were connected to piped water supply and sanitation systems across India. The volume of fresh water saved by operational efficiencies, replenished through groundwater recharge, and made accessible through our Water.org initiatives together accounted for 93% of the direct water footprint of our logistics sites in India in 2023.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Human Rights

Respect for human rights is woven throughout our business activities and relationships, and we work to engage with partners and suppliers that are also committed to respecting human and labor rights. Just as we are committed to promoting the rights of our employees, we are committed to working with our suppliers to embed respect for human rights in their operations and supply chains and to help us further our goal to support the fundamental dignity of everyone we work with.

We take pride in our long-standing dedication and commitment to human rights. While we continue to make progress, we know that this work is ongoing, and there is always more to be done. We are constantly learning and making improvements to our policies, programs, and educational resources to help ensure that our employees and workers everywhere we operate are treated with respect, know their rights, and can safely speak up if they encounter risks at work.

# Our Approach

Our strategy to deliver on these commitments is based on the UNGPs and has five pillars:

- Develop and maintain strong policies and standards: Our policies and standards are the backbone of our human rights strategy, spanning a diverse array of people-centric topics.
- Embed human rights into our business operations and decision-making: We are committed to embedding human rights considerations into decision-making across our business and into our policy and governance framework, including by raising awareness among our employees on human rights issues through education and trainings.
- Assess, prioritize, and address risk: We have robust processes that allow us to effectively identify, prioritize, and ultimately address human rights risks across our business and supply chain.
- Engage with stakeholders: We are committed to driving best practices in human rights due diligence by expanding our stakeholder engagement. Through collaboration with stakeholders including supply chain workers, employees and contractors, customers, and communities, we are creating effective, sustainable solutions that put people first.
- Improve access to effective grievance mechanisms and remediation: We offer multiple channels for our employees to voice grievances and concerns. We work hard to raise employee awareness of these grievance mechanisms and engage with suppliers to do the same for their workers.

# Our Progress

Respecting human rights is critical to Amazon’s broader sustainability efforts and an area that requires ongoing, active work across each of our strategic pillars. In 2023, we maintained our focus on existing programs and embarked on new work and partnerships to continue delivering on our commitments.

# Embedding Human Rights into Our Business

As a global company, we recognize the responsibility and opportunity we have to raise awareness among our employees on human rights issues. We have a central team that works across the company to conduct human rights due diligence and integrate human rights considerations into business decisions, and we strive to embed our human rights principles in employees’ everyday work by offering training curricula.

In 2023, we launched an online training, available to all Amazon employees, intended to raise awareness on the importance of the company’s commitment to human rights. We also offer our employees training tailored to some of Amazon’s salient human rights risks. For example, in 2023, we updated our Forced Labor Awareness training, which is available to employees in seven languages and is customized for regional risks. The training builds awareness of the signs of potential cases of forced labor in the workplace and demonstrates how to report concerns to appropriate authorities. Updates enhance learners’ experience and direct them to our most current internal resources.

As another example, we introduced “The Five Principles of Responsible Purchasing” in 2023 to strengthen our sourcing and procurement teams’ understanding of how purchasing practices can drive respect for human rights in our supply chain. This online training, developed by the Better Buying Institute, explains how our daily business operations can help suppliers improve factory working conditions and environmental performance.

# Human Rights

# Mechanisms to Assess, Prioritize, and Address Risk

We are committed to assessing, prioritizing, and addressing adverse human rights impacts connected to our business, and we continuously work to improve our approach. Within Amazon’s own operations, we deploy a variety of mechanisms to assess and respond to risks specific to Amazon businesses, including the sectors and the countries where we operate. We have a centralized team of experts who work across the company to conduct human rights and environmental due diligence. With support from this team, Amazon businesses work toward integrating our human rights principles into their operations and business relationships by conducting human rights risk assessments and remedying identified issues.

# Human Rights Assessments

Identifying and prioritizing the most salient risks connected to Amazon operations and business relationships is central to our human rights due diligence practices. As we continuously improve and expand these practices, we use human rights assessment methodologies to identify and mitigate human rights risks. These assessments help us understand the causes of systemic issues, enhance ongoing engagement with critical stakeholders, implement the correct risk-based mitigation measures, and refine strategies for ongoing risk management across our supply chain. Examples of human rights assessment methodologies include:

- Human rights saliency assessments, which focus risk management action and remediation on the most severe risks relevant to a company’s business activity.
- Human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), which examine a particular business segment or product, a country of operation or sourcing, a potentially affected group, or other human rights risk areas for a specific subset of a business.
- Human rights due diligence management assessments, which analyze a business’s internal capacity to assess and respond to human rights risks.

# Identifying and Addressing Modern Slavery

Addressing modern slavery requires a holistic approach that includes commitments, resources, and innovative solutions from governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. At Amazon, we understand the important role we can play in eradicating this issue and are committed to expanding our work to understand and address any modern slavery risks that may arise in our business. We place a specific focus on vulnerable workers, including foreign and domestic migrant workers; contract, agency, and temporary workers; refugees; asylum seekers; ethnic/religious minorities and displaced persons; Indigenous peoples; and young or student workers.

# Indicators across Amazon

In 2023, we launched a new initiative to identify and proactively address forced labor and modern slavery risk indicators across our business. The program brings together teams across our company to identify and eliminate any instances of exploitation—with a focus on victim safety. Working with both internal and external experts in human trafficking, the cross-functional team is establishing clear protocols, mandatory training, and policies on identifying potential victims of forced labor or modern slavery within our business operations, as well as detailing what employees should do if they observe any indicators of human trafficking. These include guidance on ensuring victim safety and providing immediate support and assistance to them, as well as involving relevant authorities and support organizations.

# Learn more about our salient human rights risks

In 2022, following several other HRIAs, we published an HRIA report with Twitch. In 2023, we conducted a human rights saliency assessment for Amazon Private Brands to better understand priority human rights risks across our products and how to best address them. We also identified ways to facilitate stakeholder relationships at a more localized level in the Private Brands supply chain.

# Supply Chain Due Diligence

We understand that as our supply chain evolves, expanding into new geographies and areas of business, so too do the risks we face. We’re committed to growing and adapting our work to meet these challenges—and helping others do so as well. Each year, we expand on our commitment to conduct business-specific human rights assessments, ensuring we are always raising the bar on how we evaluate and respond to risks across our operations and supply chain. These assessments allow us to identify salient risks, build capacity and business-level ownership aligned to those risks, and conduct targeted human rights and environmental due diligence to monitor and manage compliance.

# Whole Foods Market

In 2020, we worked with Article One, a business and human rights consulting firm, to complete an enterprise-wide human rights saliency assessment. Through this assessment, we identified nine salient human rights risks across our operations and business relationships. That same year, we also initiated a business-level HRIA with Amazon Devices. Whole Foods Market, with support from Amazon’s central human rights team, worked with third-party advisory firm Human Level to conduct a human rights due diligence management assessment in 2023. This assessment helped Whole Foods Market better understand and improve the quality of its human rights due diligence governance. In 2024, we are building on the success of Whole Foods Market’s 2023 human rights due diligence management assessment by expanding it to all of Amazon’s global grocery business.

# Human Rights

# Meaningful Consultation with Stakeholders

Human rights risks are systemic and complex, and addressing them requires us to reach well outside of our own operations. Engagement with external stakeholders is essential to identifying positive outcomes for people across our business and key to our human rights due diligence approach.

We collaborate with credible, knowledgeable, and innovative partner organizations around the world who share our vision. Together, we examine assessment findings, help remediate our salient human rights risks, and advance effective solutions that improve working conditions for people throughout our supply chain. We also rely on experts and affected rights-holders to inform our approach and validate our efforts. Examples of our partnerships include:

# Thorn

A nonprofit that builds technology to combat child sexual abuse. Amazon provides millions of dollars in AWS credits to power Thorn’s tools, and Thorn leverages a variety of AWS solutions to support Safer, a tool that uses advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) at scale. In 2023, Amazon worked with the center to deliver an online training on child labor prevention and remediation, as well as young worker management, to our central human rights team and other key internal stakeholders.

# Polaris

A nonprofit AWS customer that leads a survivor-centered, justice- and equity-driven movement to end human trafficking in the U.S. AWS provides financial and technical support to enhance Polaris’s data collection and operations and improve trafficking identification and prevention. In 2023, AWS delivered hundreds of thousands of dollars in AWS credits to help fund Polaris’s work. Since 2007, Polaris has identified over 82,300 situations of human trafficking.

# Truckers Against Trafficking

An organization that stands committed to educate, equip, empower, and mobilize members of the trucking, bus, and energy industries to address human trafficking. In addition to being a Truckers Against Trafficking corporate sponsor, we include Truckers Against Trafficking modules in our training for internal fleet drivers to help them identify and respond to potential human trafficking victims. In 2023, we trained 9,970 Amazon transportation associates.

# National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)

A child protection organization committed to aiding the search for missing children, reducing child sexual exploitation, and preventing child victimization. NCMEC utilizes AWS solutions to support several of its programs and an AWS representative serves on NCMEC’s Board of Directors. In 2023, NCMEC received hundreds of thousands of dollars in AWS credits to support critical applications that help make sure every child has a safe childhood.

# YESS: Yarn Ethically and Sustainably Sourced

An initiative of the Responsible Sourcing Network, works to support fabric and spinning mills in implementing a risk-based due diligence approach for cotton sourcing, and promotes collaboration with the goal of preventing, mitigating, and remediating forced labor in cotton production. In 2023, YESS launched its program to assess fabric and spinning mills in Pakistan and India. Amazon is supporting YESS’s efforts to scale and expand the program to Vietnam and Bangladesh.

# Tech Against Trafficking (TAT)

A coalition of companies and global experts working to eradicate human trafficking using technology. An Amazon representative serves as a member of its steering committee. In 2023, we worked with Polaris and the Issara Institute—both participants of the TAT Accelerator—to scale their technology solutions to address human trafficking.

# The Mekong Club

A nonprofit that works with the private sector to address modern slavery. Through the organization, we developed a supplier-facing remediation guideline and trained vendors in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on responsible recruitment practices.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Access to Effective Grievance Mechanisms and Remediation

By listening to the people connected to our business, we can better understand their experiences and concerns, address risks they face, remedy issues, and ultimately improve our workplace experience. Our grievance policies and practices are designed to promote respect for the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining and comply with the legal requirements of the countries where we operate.

We empower and encourage all our employees to share their concerns and communicate openly and candidly with us through various channels, including grievance mechanisms and avenues for effective two-way dialogue with leadership. We have processes in place to promptly review and address employee suggestions, concerns, and grievances—making improvements and providing remedies in response.

Learn more about our grievance mechanisms and remediation processes for employees.

# Looking Forward

Our commitment to respecting human rights is unwavering. In 2024, Amazon will work with internal and external human rights experts to update our Global Human Rights Principles. We will continue raising awareness among our employees, suppliers, and partners about the importance we place on advancing human rights throughout our business and supply chain, as well as our expectation that respect for human rights guide their everyday work and business decisions. We will also uphold our engagement and collaboration with these stakeholders to help us deliver on our priorities and raise the bar for human rights across our industries.

In 2024, Amazon will continue to scale our human rights and environmental due diligence programs using systems that enable our businesses to get even more granular about their human rights risks—identifying business-specific priority issues and better targeting risk management actions most relevant to their sectors and activities.

Beyond our own employees, we expect every supplier in our supply chain to provide their workers access to effective grievance mechanisms. We work with our suppliers to increase their capacity to develop these mechanisms, helping them create channels to hear directly from workers about their experiences and support the resolution of issues they report.

# Human Rights

# Our Approach

At Amazon, we are laser focused on requiring safe and healthy working conditions throughout our supply chain. We have dedicated teams in key sourcing regions that engage directly with suppliers to communicate our standards, evaluate risks in our supply chain, and help suppliers build their capacities to provide working environments that are safe and respectful of human rights. We also work closely with strategic partners across the globe to enhance our influence.

We continue to focus our efforts on our six priority commitment areas:

- Safe and healthy workplaces
- Gender equity
- Fair wages
- Responsible recruitment and freely chosen employment
- Environmental protection
- Access to effective grievance mechanisms

# Our Supply Chain Standards

Our Supply Chain Standards are the backbone of our efforts to enable a responsible supply chain. They apply to all suppliers of goods and services for Amazon, including service providers, vendors, selling partners, contractors, and subcontractors (collectively, “suppliers”). Products sold in Amazon stores, as well as products and services provided to us, must be manufactured, produced, or provided in accordance with these standards.

# Standards

Selling partners are third-party sellers and retail vendors that sell or provide products and services in Amazon stores. Our Supply Chain Standards apply to all products and services offered in our stores. We encourage selling partners to perform due diligence to help ensure their products and services are produced and supplied in ways that respect human rights and the environment and protect the fundamental dignity of workers.

# Supplier Assessments

We assess suppliers of Amazon-branded products globally during onboarding, and periodically thereafter, to evaluate their compliance with our Supply Chain Standards in four categories: Labor Rights, Ethics, Environment, and Health and Safety. These categories include subcategories such as nondiscrimination, emergency preparedness, hazardous substances, and transparency. By assessing the performance of our suppliers, we improve working conditions and strengthen the resilience of our supply chain.

# Supply Chain Transparency

Supply chain transparency is a valuable tool to address risks in our supply chain and identify opportunities for collaboration on systemic issues. That’s why we publish a supplier list and interactive supply chain map with details on finished-product suppliers of Amazon-branded apparel.

# Our Supply Chain Standards

Our Supply Chain Standards are the backbone of our efforts to enable a more responsible supply chain. They apply to all suppliers of goods and services for Amazon, including service providers, vendors, selling partners, contractors, and subcontractors (collectively, “suppliers”). Products sold in Amazon stores, as well as products and services provided to us, must be manufactured, produced, or provided in accordance with these standards.

# Our Approach

# Our Principles

# Our Requirements

# We are committed to

providing products and services that are produced or supplied in a way that respects human rights and the environment. Our commitment and approach are informed by leading international standards and frameworks developed by the United Nations (UN) and the International Labour Organization (ILO). We apply these standards using three principles.

# Supply Chain Accountability

We work with suppliers to help them understand our standards. Suppliers are required to hold their own suppliers, subcontractors, recruitment agents, and labor agents accountable for abiding by applicable laws and our standards and to work with them to raise awareness of our standards.

# Labor Rights

Amazon does not tolerate the use of forced labor or child labor. Additional provisions cover requirements related to wage and benefits, working hours, migrant workers, anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, grievance mechanisms, and freedom of association.

# Health and Safety

Suppliers are required to provide workers with a safe and healthy work environment, including complying with applicable laws regarding occupational safety, working conditions, and health standards.

# Inclusivity

Suppliers must apply our standards to all workers without discrimination and regardless of workers’ personal characteristics or legally protected status.

# Ethical Behavior

Amazon will not tolerate suppliers that engage in unethical behaviors, including bribery, corruption, and whistleblower retaliation. Suppliers must comply with applicable laws related to anti-corruption, data privacy, trade, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI).

# Environment

Suppliers should respect the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. Suppliers are required to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations.

# Continuous Improvement

Amazon operates on a policy of continuous improvement, and we are committed to working with suppliers to embed respect for human rights and the environment in their operations and supply chains, improve protections for their workers and workplaces, and address nonconformance with these standards.

# Responsible and Sustainable Material and Commodity Sourcing

Amazon is committed to avoiding the use of minerals that have fueled conflict. Suppliers should identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products and source these commodities in a way that respects local communities and protects ecosystems.

# Land and Natural Resource Rights

Suppliers must respect the legal land rights of individuals, Indigenous people, and local communities.

# Management Systems

Suppliers should adopt a management system to drive continuous improvement against our standards and maintain a process for timely remediation of nonconformance identified by assessments, investigations, and reports.

# Assessment Findings

In 2023, we performed 3,011 assessments of suppliers of Amazon-branded products across three categories:

- Initial assessments: Suppliers must submit Amazon-approved assessments of their facilities before beginning production of Amazon-branded products.
- Maintenance assessments: Suppliers must submit ongoing Amazon-approved assessments while producing Amazon-branded products every one or two years, based on whether they are located in a high- or low-risk country and on previous audit performance.
- Verification assessments: When high-level issues are identified, suppliers must develop corrective action plans to address identified issues as well as long-term plans to prevent recurrence.

# High-Level and Medium-Level Findings

A high-level finding is an issue that has caused or is likely to cause immediate harm to workers or communities or demonstrates egregious unethical behavior. A medium-level finding is an issue that poses significant risk of harm to workers or communities or demonstrates unethical or exploitative behavior. For low-level issues, we monitor suppliers for continuous improvement through maintenance audits.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Human Rights

# Responsible Supply Chain

Throughout our relationship with our suppliers, we provide resources and training to help them strengthen their ability to respect human rights and the environment within their own workplace and supply chain.

In 2023, we hosted in-person and online training events on our Supply Chain Standards. These trainings reached 458 suppliers in 14 countries/regions.

We also launched a new in-person peer-learning workshop series that convenes factory management to hear from industry experts and share best practices for addressing common challenges. This workshop series reached 105 suppliers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mainland China, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.

# Sustainable Products and Materials

We work with suppliers globally to support worker health and safety through targeted programs and partnerships that increase worker awareness of safety issues, support their well-being, and promote a culture of shared safety responsibility.

We also partner with global organizations that are dedicated to maintaining safe and healthy workplaces in the countries where we operate. In February 2024, we joined Nirapon (safe place in Bangla), an industry-led nonprofit that works with global brands, retailers, manufacturers, and other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to create and sustain a culture of workplace safety in factories in Bangladesh.

# Fair Wages

We believe everyone has a right to be paid fairly for the work they perform, and ensuring workers receive fair pay remains a global, cross-industry issue. That’s why fair wages is one of our six priority commitment areas.

We monitor wage payments throughout our supply chains to inform more meaningful supplier engagements, enhance our human rights due diligence processes, and promote continuous improvement in the fair and on-time payment of wages. In accordance with our Supply Chain Standards, our suppliers must pay legally required compensation, including overtime and benefits, and we support them in evaluating whether their workers earn enough to meet their basic needs and those of their families.

# Gender Equity

Amazon has a long-standing commitment to gender equity, which is a fundamental human right and necessary foundation of a sustainable supply chain. We strive to engage with more women-owned businesses throughout our supply chains and support women in making their own decisions on health, finances, and career development.

In 2023, we began working with select suppliers to benchmark worker compensation against regionally specific fair wages, focusing on electronics manufacturing and packaging—two areas where there is a lack of industry-wide data on worker wages.

# Building, Electrical, and Fire Safety

Building, electrical, and fire safety is a critical part of our commitment to maintain safe and healthy workplaces. In 2023, we began the process to join Life and Building Safety (LABS) Initiative, officially becoming members in April 2024.

Through our Building, Electrical, and Fire Safety (BEFS) program, we also conduct issue-specific assessments that identify and remediate structural, electrical, and fire safety issues, going beyond traditional social compliance audits in countries that are not covered by Nirapon or LABS.

# Progress across Our Six Priority Commitment Areas

In 2023, we continued making progress across each of our six priority commitment areas through continuous commitment and action.

# Measuring Good Health

Examining the outcomes of our health and safety programs and partnerships helps build evidence for continued investment in worker health that can support ongoing and future efforts throughout our supply chain.

In 2023, an assessment we conducted found that every dollar we invested in supplier health projects during COVID-19 in Bangladesh and Vietnam generated approximately $3.02 of socioeconomic value, including reduced health expenditures for our factory workforce and their families.

# Responsible Recruitment and Freely Chosen Employment

As outlined in our Global Human Rights Principles, we do not tolerate child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any form in our operations or supply chain. We advance holistic approaches to combat forced labor and ensure vulnerable workers, especially foreign migrants, have access to transparent information on working conditions including pay, hiring practices, and contract terms.

# Partnering to Drive Workplace Health and Safety

In 2023, we collaborated with organizations around the world to support workers’ rights to safe and healthy workplaces. Examples of our progress and impact include:

# CMS

We’ve partnered with Catalyst Management Services (CMS), a social investment specialist, to support suppliers and workers in tackling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Through this collaboration, we’re providing a telecare hotline for workers and their families to drive access to primary health care, strengthening health systems and capacities to establish crisis response plans, and building resilient supply chains that can tackle future public health crises. From December 2021 to October 2023, we provided access to critical primary health care services to over 40,000 workers.

# SCCORE

We continued to work with the International Labour Organization (ILO) Sustaining Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) program to support productive, healthy, and safe working environments among small and medium manufacturers. In 2023, 18 of our suppliers participated in SCORE training across China, India, and Indonesia, participating in over 8,500 hours of training. Third-party assessments conducted before and after training identified improvements in workplace health and safety, productivity, and worker satisfaction, as well as a reduction in accidents.

# Swasti

Through our ongoing collaboration with Swasti, a global nonprofit dedicated to providing quality health care for marginalized workers in India, we provided access to primary health care, delivered trainings on social protection, and raised awareness of gender equity and the prevention of sexual harassment among our supply chain employees in India. As of the end of 2023, we had reached over 2,060 workers in India through Swasti’s health care programs.

# TenSquared

In partnership with Social Accountability International (SAI), we launched SAI’s TenSquared in 2023, a new worker engagement program for suppliers in China, India, and Malaysia to solve health and safety issues. The structured workplace engagement program unites workers and managers to address the root causes of workplace issues and includes a goal to measurably improve a specific workplace challenge in 100 days. In this way, it helps overcome institutional hurdles to foster a culture of continuous improvement. TenSquared complements our existing safety program but requires less time and covers more regions, allowing us to scale our efforts more efficiently.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Human Rights

We engage with our suppliers to establish management systems and responsible recruitment practices that prevent forced labor risks. This includes ending worker-paid recruitment fees—a practice prohibited by our Supply Chain Standards—and requiring suppliers to reimburse any fees paid by workers at any phase of the recruitment process. When we find evidence of recruitment fees, we work with our suppliers to raise their understanding of responsible recruitment practices, create and implement remediation plans to prevent recruitment fees from being charged at any point in the hiring process moving forward, and reimburse affected workers in full and in a manner that protects them and their families from harm and retaliation.

# Responding to Violations of Our Supply Chain Standards in Saudi Arabia

In 2023, Amazon found violations of our Supply Chain Standards at a third-party licensed temporary labor agency (“third-party vendor”) in Saudi Arabia through an independent audit. The violations ranged from recruitment fees paid by migrant workers to the absence of grievance mechanisms and issues with worker accommodations. External organizations raised similar concerns and shared information with us about these and other human rights risks collected during interviews with former employees of this third-party vendor.

In response, we conducted a deeper dive into practices of our third-party vendors throughout Saudi Arabia and developed a series of short- and long-term measures to remedy immediate issues and prevent future recurrence. We brought in two independent third parties to assist with our investigation and engaged directly with contracted workers through interviews to help establish reimbursement amounts and manage repayment. As of February 2024, we had reimbursed more than 700 contracted workers across all our third-party vendors in Saudi Arabia, totaling more than $1.9 million in reimbursed recruitment fees and related costs.

# Environmental Protection

As one of our six priority commitment areas, we strive to source products and services that avoid unnecessary environmental harm. To do this, we work with industry experts to increase our understanding of the environmental challenges we face, our performance against them, and effective solutions we can implement to address them. For example, since 2020, we have worked with the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs, a nonprofit environmental research organization in China that focuses on promoting environmental information disclosure and improving environmental governance. We leverage its public database to screen our supplier sites in China for environmental violations. In 2023, we screened 100% of our product manufacturing suppliers of Amazon Private Brands, AWS, Amazon Devices, and Amazon Fresh Private Brands in China.

Module (FEM), a self-assessment owned and developed by Cascale, exclusively licensed to the Worldly sustainability data and insights platform. The assessment evaluates performance and prioritizes opportunities for improvement across seven areas: air emissions, carbon emissions, chemicals management, environmental management systems, waste, wastewater, and water. In 2023, 67% of Amazon’s Private Brands Tier 1 apparel suppliers completed the Higg FEM, helping them better understand their environmental performance and practices.

# Looking Forward

Building responsible supply chains is an ongoing endeavor—one that requires collective effort and continuous improvement from Amazon, our suppliers, and our network of expert partners. We are investing in identifying and addressing the most severe human rights and environmental risks throughout our supply chain. We will continue engaging internal and external stakeholders in our efforts to make progress across our six priority commitment areas and, in doing so, enable working conditions that respect supply chain workers and the environments where we operate.

# Report to Resolution: The Amader Kotha Process in Action

Whenever grievances are raised through the Amader Kotha Helpline, the organization works with factory management to address and resolve issues as quickly as possible and, ultimately, improve working conditions for employees. In 2023, through the Amader Kotha Helpline, workers in Bangladesh reported nearly 760 grievances, of which over 560 related to workplace concerns. The top five workplace concerns for Amazon suppliers were wages, leave, verbal abuse, factory welfare facilities, and termination, while the remaining inquiries included more general topics such as domestic issues or the government’s policy on worker benefits. Ulula, meanwhile, is available to workers in Cambodia, China, India, and Pakistan. During 2023, workers with access to Ulula most frequently reported issues related to health and safety and wages.

# Access to Effective Grievance Mechanisms

We want our supply chain workers to have the ability to voice their concerns about the workplace in a safe and confidential manner. To do this, we connect suppliers and service providers with trusted tools, products, and systems to hear directly from workers about their experiences and support the resolution of issues from workers’ perspectives. We believe this is fundamental to supporting the safety and well-being of the workers in our supply chain.

In 2023, we helped connect supplier sites across Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand with independent grievance mechanisms. Of the nearly 800 worker grievances raised using these mechanisms, 100% were investigated and resolved. The Amader Kotha Helpline and Ulula are two examples of effective grievance mechanisms that we introduced to our suppliers. The Amader Kotha Helpline is an independent helpline serving the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh, while Ulula uses a range of grievance mechanisms—including helplines to messaging platforms—accessible globally.

For all individuals, including members of the public, employees, and workers in our supply chain, we introduced a new way to notify us about potential human rights and environmental concerns—a web form where people can anonymously report cases directly to Amazon. The form is available in 19 languages and dialects and can be accessed globally.

# Sustainable Products and Materials

Customers want products that align with their values, and this often includes products created with sustainability in mind. We believe it is important to offer more sustainable products to our customers without compromising on quality, safety, or cost. We are working to do this within our own brands by incorporating sourcing and design practices that support responsible supply chains, circular economy principles, decarbonization, and the use of safer chemicals. At the same time, we’re working closely with our selling partners to help them offer more products that qualify for at least one of the 55 certifications in our Climate Pledge Friendly program. To help them get started with Amazon’s sustainability programs, we launched the Sustainability Solutions Hub. For our customers, this means access to more products recognized by certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly program that meet their needs, as well as new ways to easily shop for and discover them.

# Our Approach

We seek to offer our customers more products that align with their preferences and our sustainability goals. Our sustainability efforts are not limited to our own operations. We look for ways to encourage our selling partners to develop products with sustainability in mind, such as through our Climate Pledge Friendly program and the Sustainability Solutions Hub. We also participate in industry partnerships and working groups to drive greater adoption of sustainable and responsible practices.

We are improving the materials and sourcing standards for our products, as well as building on our responsible sourcing roadmap developed in 2022 to improve visibility across our supply chains. This roadmap focuses on key materials used for Amazon private brands products and Amazon devices. We continue to work toward our sourcing goals, including our commitment to reduce deforestation risks associated with raw materials and ingredients used in Amazon and Whole Foods Market private brands products.

In addition to these commitments, Amazon also complies with European regulations to encourage responsible sourcing and reduce deforestation. We also incorporate recycled materials into many new products and product packaging, particularly in Amazon devices, where feasible.

While many of our sourcing commitments identify materials we seek to include in our private brands products, we also identify those we seek to avoid. Our Formulated Products Restricted Substances List is an extensive list of chemicals we seek to exclude in Amazon private brands baby, household cleaning, personal care, and beauty products in the U.S. and Europe. Our Restricted Substances List for packaging outlines the chemicals of concern we seek to avoid in the packaging of Amazon private brands food and beverage products sold in North America. Our private brands apparel, accessory, footwear, and home textile products in North America, Europe, and Japan seek to comply with the Apparel and Footwear International RSL Management (AFIRM) Group’s Restricted Substances List.

Our compliance teams are responsible for enforcing these restricted substances lists with our suppliers. All cotton for Amazon private brands apparel is sourced from recycled materials, from farms certified as producing organic cotton, or through the Better Cotton Initiative.

# Amazon Private Brands

We consider sustainability from the beginning stages of design for our private brands products. Through our commodities sourcing goals, we prioritize using recycled content, reducing material use, and improving recyclability of our products. We also consider the use phase of our products and have programs in place to help customers keep their products in use for longer. In 2023, we expanded these efforts by launching a spare parts and repair program in Europe for our private brands products.

Amazon non-grocery private brands offers everything from beauty and skin care to diapers and infant wipes. In 2023, we published a Formulated Products Restricted Substances List for cleaning, beauty, and personal care. We also expanded our compliance with AFIRM’s Restricted Substances List to home textile products, which we actively enforce with our suppliers.

# Responsible Mineral Sourcing

While Amazon does not engage in direct sourcing from mine sites and smelters, we are committed to avoiding the use of minerals that have fueled conflict. We strive to have 100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) smelters and refiners in our supply chain conform with a recognized minerals certification program. These certifications, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)’s Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), are critical to enabling responsible raw material sourcing and processing upstream in the supply chain.

# Amazon Devices

We believe products can and should be more sustainable while maintaining high quality and affordability. In 2023, we launched 28 new Echo, Fire TV, Fire tablet, Kindle e-reader, Ring, Blink, and smart home devices and accessories that were recognized by certifications in our Climate Pledge Friendly program.

We design our devices with a focus on carbon reduction and manufacture them with responsibly sourced materials. Sustainability is considered throughout the lifecycle of a product—from how we build it to how our customers use and retire it. We want every new Amazon device to be more energy-efficient and less resource-intensive than the previous generation.

# Climate Pledge Friendly

Our Climate Pledge Friendly program helps customers discover more sustainable products that are recognized to have at least one sustainable feature. In 2023, our customers continued to embrace this program, purchasing 1.16 billion items recognized by certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly program—a 42% increase from 2022.

We collaborate with our selling partners to identify opportunities for them to develop more sustainable products and apply for certifications that recognize the strides they are already making in sustainability. In 2023, we worked with a variety of selling partners—such as L’Oréal, Levi’s, and others.

We continue to evolve the customer shopping experience and make the discovery of products with sustainability features even easier. In March 2024, we launched a new online shopping experience that highlights these features, such as recycled materials and organic content, in products that are recognized by one or more certification in the Climate Pledge Friendly program.

# Improving Customer Discovery

We have helped nearly 37.6 million Amazon customers switch to products recognized by certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly program, in part by enabling new online shopping features to guide their browsing.

# For our Amazon Business customers

We are partnering with them to create procurement policies that place a preference on products recognized by certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly program. As of December 2023, more than 51,000 businesses had these buying policies in place, up from 18,000 in 2022.

Building diverse and inclusive supply chains drives innovation, supports competitiveness, meets customers’ expectations, and spurs local economic growth through community investment and job creation. For Amazon, a diverse and inclusive supply chain not only strengthens the resilience of our business but also drives the ability to innovate on behalf of our customers through the diverse perspectives and knowledge of people from all backgrounds. We are dedicated to advancing supplier diversity and inclusion (SDI) throughout our supply chain—engaging with diverse-owned and small businesses and driving long-term economic sustainability in the communities we serve.

# Our Approach

Through Amazon’s global supplier diversity and inclusion (SDI) strategy, we strive to build a more inclusive and equitable supply chain that fully reflects the diversity of our customers and employees. To achieve this, we are prioritizing three actions:

- Driving economic benefits by scaling existing and onboarding new certified diverse suppliers, which are businesses certified to be at least 51% owned and operated by an individual or group that is part of a traditionally underrepresented or underserved community.
- Expanding SDI initiatives across the globe.
- Partnering with advocacy organizations to further engage with certified Tier 1 diverse suppliers worldwide.

# Our Progress

Driving Economic Benefits with Diverse Businesses. In 2023, we enhanced our Tier 2 reporting system to enable our suppliers to report their diverse supplier spend on a quarterly and, for some, monthly basis.

The Positive Effects of Supplier Diversity in Amazon’s Supply Chain. Amazon believes that the intentional inclusion of diversity in our supply chain is a powerful catalyst for economic growth in the communities where we operate—helping increase job creation, wealth distribution, and local development.

# Supplier Diversity by the Numbers

|---|---|
|Spend on Diverse Suppliers|$4.3B|
|Jobs Supported for Diverse Suppliers|30,000|
|Wages Earned for Diverse Suppliers|$2.8B|
|Number of Countries with SDI Programs|8|

# Certified Tier 1 Diverse Suppliers

Our SDI program is dedicated to the inclusion of businesses owned by an individual or group that is a member of a traditionally underrepresented or underutilized group. Spending with certified Tier 1 diverse suppliers spurs economic growth and supports jobs in our suppliers’ communities.

# Expanding SDI Globally

As a global company, we are able to drive economic empowerment for more businesses around the world. While Amazon's SDI initiative began in the U.S., we are focused on expanding these efforts internationally, integrating more certified diverse suppliers into our global supply chain. We are committed to an inclusive global supply chain and insist on the highest bar of equivalent certification standards and processes, as utilized in the U.S.

We encourage our Tier 1 suppliers to also consider purchasing goods and services from certified diverse companies. This creates a ripple effect of investment deeper in our supply chain.

In 2023, Amazon expanded our SDI strategy outside the U.S. for the first time, launching in seven new countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, India, South Africa, and the UK. This work represents a meaningful step in our journey to...

# Community Impact

To support Amazon’s global expansion, we participated in SDI events in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands, including conferences hosted by Supply Nation (Australia), the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council, and Minority Supplier Development UK. We also participated in the European Supplier Diversity Program (ESDP)’s inaugural procurement conference in the Netherlands. We are committed to supporting ESDP as they work to empower ethnic minority- and immigrant-owned businesses across European markets.

In 2023, we were inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR), a group of corporations dedicated to spending $1 billion each annually with certified U.S. Tier 1 diverse suppliers. As a BDR member, an Amazon representative serves on the Governance, Global Strategy, and Annual Summit committees, providing a platform to share and learn new ideas and approaches to SDI.

Additionally, an Amazon representative was elected to the NMSDC Board of Directors and appointed to NMSDC’s Global Committee. Amazon is also proud to maintain our seat on the WBENC Board of Directors.

We will continue to actively engage in strategic partnerships to support SDI initiatives globally. In 2024, Amazon will focus on three priorities across our SDI work: We will strengthen our SDI strategy across the U.S. and the seven additional countries where we’ve implemented it, while continuing to expand to new countries around the world, such as Chile and Mexico. We will advance SDI technology, such as improving our tracking mechanisms for Tier 1 and Tier 2 spend, to create value and efficiency. And we will invest in supplier onboarding, development, and sourcing strategies with the support and partnership of global diversity advocacy organizations.

# Awards and Recognitions

In 2023, Amazon earned the following recognitions for our SDI efforts:

- E-Mega Award: NMSDC Dallas-Fort Worth Minority Supplier Development Council

Companies have an important opportunity to create meaningful, tangible change in the communities where they operate. Locally driven programs for communities benefit both residents and businesses, spurring innovation and economic growth. Amazon has a presence in thousands of communities around the world, and with this broad scale comes broad responsibility. We strive to leverage our size, reach, and ability to innovate quickly to strengthen the communities where our employees live and work. An important part of this is collaboration, which is why we work side by side with local partners to find solutions to our communities’ most pressing challenges and build long-term, innovative programs that have a lasting, positive influence.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Our Approach

Amazon’s culture is built around finding effective solutions to difficult problems, and we apply this thinking to support the communities where our employees live and work. We leverage our people, technology, and logistics networks to build programs and products that help enable future generations to thrive in our communities. We focus on several priority areas across our business and respond to emergent needs where we are uniquely positioned to make a positive difference. Our work especially emphasizes historically underrepresented communities, because we envision a world that embraces diverse perspectives and where all individuals have equitable opportunities.

# Amazon’s community impact efforts are focused on seven key areas:

- Supporting economic impact in communities: Amazon adds economic vibrancy to the communities where we operate through investments and job creation. Our investments in economies across the globe expand opportunities for local residents and small businesses and catalyze local economic activity.
- Creating and preserving affordable housing: All people should have access to housing they can afford, but many communities in the U.S. are facing an affordable housing shortage, with low-income and minority families disproportionately affected. That is why we created the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, a $2 billion commitment to use our scale and reach to support innovative housing solutions in the communities we call home.
- Addressing food insecurity and basic needs: Amazon aims to improve access to healthy, affordable food for customers in underserved communities across the U.S. Each year, we donate groceries to local food banks and leverage our logistics network to provide free delivery of groceries to families in need. Additionally, the Whole Foods Market Foundation seeks to enhance livelihoods in its sourcing communities, bring more nutritious foods into children’s schools and homes, and improve local food systems and healthy food access. It is also investing in producer loan and accelerator programs that empower small-scale, local, and emerging producers to grow their businesses.
- Empowering students and adults through education and skills training: We believe in the transformative power of education, which is why we invest in programs that help young learners, higher education students, and adults unlock their full potential. Our goal is to help 29 million people globally grow their technical skills with free cloud computing training by 2025 through AWS-designed programs. Additionally, with the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and the need for an AI-savvy workforce, Amazon has pledged to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people globally by 2025.
- Supporting disaster relief and response efforts: Our global logistics capabilities, combined with AWS technology, make us uniquely suited to help people when natural disasters strike. Our disaster relief and response efforts provide fast, effective aid for affected communities.
- Funding nature in our communities: We support the restoration and conservation of natural spaces in communities across the globe. Through Amazon’s Right Now Climate Fund, we invest in projects that aim to mitigate the effects of climate change, add green space to urban areas, improve biodiversity, and enhance livelihoods.

Through support from the Right Now Climate Fund, CIFAL Málaga-UNITAR and Amazon launched the Green Helmets educational initiative, designed to teach young people in Spain how to develop and implement sustainability projects.

# Our Progress

# Supporting Economic Impact in Communities

To continue serving and innovating for our customers, we invest heavily in the communities where we operate. These investments spur new economic activity that, in turn, results in expanded opportunities for local residents and small businesses. Amazon has made significant investments in the U.S. economy since 2010, which have contributed more than $880 billion to national gross domestic product (GDP). We have supported 4.5 million American jobs through full- and part-time jobs created directly by Amazon, jobs indirectly supported by our investments in areas like construction and logistics, and jobs created by small and medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon.com. In fact, Amazon has created more jobs in the past decade than any other U.S. company. We understand the value of developing opportunities for community members to climb the economic ladder and believe in helping them every step of the way.

With approximately 1.5 million full- and part-time global employees as of the end of 2023, Amazon adds economic vibrancy in the places where we invest: 47% of the people we hired for operations roles in 2023 were unemployed before joining Amazon, and two of every five U.S. jobs that we’ve created over the last five years have been in towns with fewer than 50,000 residents. Since 2010, Amazon has invested over €150 billion in our EU business and employs more than 150,000 people in permanent roles across 20 EU member states.

# Creating and Preserving Affordable Housing

In our hometown communities of Washington state’s Puget Sound region and Arlington, Virginia, we are working to address the nation’s housing affordability challenges through low-rate loans, grants, and partnerships with local governments and nonprofit agencies. Through the Amazon Housing Equity Fund (HEF), we have committed $2 billion to create and preserve more than 20,000 affordable homes in three communities where we have a high concentration of corporate employees: Washington state’s Puget Sound region; Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee.

Addressing the housing crisis requires collective action, and we are focusing on creating equal access to development opportunities. We’re assisting more minority-led real estate developers in overcoming entry barriers to the affordable housing development industry. As of the end of 2023, developers of color were responsible for 43% of Amazon’s HEF projects. And through our Housing Equity Accelerator Fellowship, we supported 38 emerging and diverse real estate developers with in-person instruction on real estate fundamentals, affordable housing trends, public policy, and financing practices, as well as access to expert business advisors, professional networking opportunities, and capital for pre-development expenses.

In 2023, Amazon donated over $6 million to Mary’s Place to support its ongoing operations and provide funding toward a new project in Burien, Washington. This project would replace an existing shelter and provide more than 200 beds of emergency family shelter, housing, outreach, and prevention services for families. It would also include 90 units of permanent, affordable housing to be developed by Mercy Housing Northwest.

# Supporting Real Estate Developers of Color

Mary’s Place is a nonprofit operating in Washington state’s King County that provides women and families with emergency shelter, mobile outreach services, and rental assistance and stability support. Since 2016, Amazon has distributed over $100 million in cash and in-kind donations to Mary’s Place to address family homelessness in King County. In 2020, Amazon and Mary’s Place united to open the Mary’s Place Family Center in The Regrade—a first-of-its-kind permanent family shelter that operates inside an Amazon building on our Seattle campus.

# Investment Summary

|Location|Rental Homes|Residents Supported|
|---|---|---|
|Washington state’s Puget Sound region|5,300|11,600|
|Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia|8,400|18,500|
|Nashville, Tennessee|1,300|2,900|
|Additional Permanent Homes|800|1,700|

Amazon’s HEF commitment has increased affordable multifamily housing by 31% in Bellevue, Washington, and by 23% in Arlington.

# Addressing Food Insecurity and Basic Needs

We strive to bring healthy, affordable food to our communities through our delivery service providers (DSPs), donations, funding, and partnerships with organizations helping individuals and families faced with food insecurity.

Our Community Delivery program leverages our network of last mile fleet DSPs to provide free meal deliveries from food banks and other local organizations to households in need. Through this program, in 2023, we delivered over 10 million meals to underserved families to help alleviate food insecurity across the U.S.

In partnership with local food banks, we are scaling our food redistribution efforts to contribute to food security in local communities. As of the end of 2023, 100% of our grocery facilities in North America and Europe partner with a local food bank, over 40 of which are Feeding America affiliates. As a proud partner of Feeding America, Amazon Fresh also donated $250,000 to the organization’s efforts to increase food security in the U.S.

# Whole Foods Market

The Whole Foods Market foundations (Whole Planet Foundation, Whole Kids Foundation, and Whole Cities Foundation) further fulfill the company’s higher purpose to nourish people and the planet by helping to advance healthy food access, nutrition, and economic opportunities in local and global communities.

Whole Planet supports organizations around the world that increase access for financially excluded people, often living near the poverty line, to generate income and meet their basic needs. In 2023, the foundation developed a new goal: to empower an additional 300,000 people to generate income and meet their basic needs in countries where Whole Foods Market sources products by 2030. The foundation and donors provided over $7.6 million in grants and over 26,610 microloans across 37 countries toward this goal.

# Whole Kids

The Whole Kids Foundation is dedicated to helping children eat better by delivering education grants, supporting schools to transform their food options, and inspiring families to improve children’s nutrition and wellness. In 2023, the foundation supported more than 1.4 million students and 592 teachers at 636 schools. In addition, grants supported 509 edible gardens and 43 salad bars, enabling schools to provide kids with daily access to fresh fruits and vegetables.

To help students learn about the vital role pollinators play in our food system and observe bees up close, the foundation provided 108 beehive grants to schools and nonprofit organizations.

# Whole Cities

Whole Cities’ programs aim to advance individual and community health through local partnerships and expanded access to fresh, healthy food and nutrition education. In 2023, the foundation awarded 64 Community First grants to nonprofits engaged with Whole Foods Market team members and economies of communities it serves—while offering a wider assortment of local, differentiated products for its customers.

# Supporting Local Communities through Our Grocery Stores

We have a hyperlocal approach to engage and give back to the communities where we operate our grocery stores that prioritizes causes that address food insecurity and sustainability. We enable stores to identify local causes that are important to their communities, which allows our grocery teams to drive meaningful benefits within each store’s region.

One hyperlocal activation supported in 2023 was in Fullerton, California, where a store partnered with their local Boys & Girls Club. Through various Boys & Girls Club initiatives—including participating in the annual Community Fair, filling backpacks with academic supplies for the start of the school year, and providing meals for Thanksgiving dinners—the store gave back to the specific needs of its community.

In collaboration with the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank, Amazon Flex drivers help deliver a monthly box of healthy, shelf-stable food to seniors who are part of their Supplemental Food Program.

# Nourishing Our Neighborhoods Program

Nourishing Our Neighborhoods was created by Whole Foods Market to expand capacity and capability for community-based food rescue organizations to move food from where it is available to where it is needed most. Marking its fourth year in 2023, Nourishing Our Neighborhoods has donated 44 refrigerated vans to community-based food rescue and redistribution programs that transport food to low-income communities across the U.S. and Canada.

In 2023, Whole Foods Market launched Nourishing Our Neighborhoods Mobile Pantry, pop-up farmers-market-style events at local schools. Each event provides fresh produce and pantry staples to 700 families. In addition, Stuff the Van events were introduced for each of the Nourishing Our Neighborhoods food rescue partners. These events were held at Whole Foods Market stores, where team members filled each of the vans with a mix of fresh produce and pantry staples. Through these events, Whole Foods Market donated over 57,585 pounds of food—enough for nearly 48,000 meals.

# Through Amazon Future Engineer

We provide childhood-to-career computer science education, focusing on students from underserved and historically marginalized communities. The program includes free computer science curricula, teacher training, and interactive virtual field trips to inspire younger students to pursue careers of the future, as well as financial support for secondary education and paid internships at Amazon to gain hands-on experience with mentorship from technology leaders.

In 2023, Amazon Future Engineer reached 3.9 million students from underrepresented communities globally. We also announced a $1.5 million donation to the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) to launch career exploration programming that will prepare U.S. students for future workforce demands.

# Student Programs

AWS InCommunities is a community outreach program that aims to positively influence the communities where AWS builds and operates its global infrastructure. Four pillars anchor this work: Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) Education; Local Skills Development; Sustainability; and Hyperlocal Social Impact.

Through its programming, in 2023, AWS InCommunities drove nearly 6 million positive community interactions—defined as an engagement with a community member that results in a benefit for the recipient. One of its most notable initiatives is the AWS InCommunities Fund, a microgrant program that supports local individuals and organizations driving positive change. AWS launched 10 of these microgrants in 2023, helping renovate schools and rural hospitals in India, establish community health care facilities in Indonesia, implement food access programs in Australia, support sustainability programs such as textile recycling in the U.S., and more.

# Empowering Students and Adults through Education and Skills Training

Amazon invests in programs to increase youth and adult access to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) opportunities. Our aim is to help young learners and workforce professionals alike develop valuable skills needed for careers in STEM fields through a broad range of education and training programs.

# Skills Programs for Adults

AWS Skills Centers, in-person learning that offers no-cost, on-site and virtual cloud computing classes, physical learning spaces, and networking events. Skills Centers are located in Seattle, Washington; Arlington, Virginia; and Cape Town, South Africa.

For adults, Amazon offers a range of free courses for individuals with technical and non-technical backgrounds to help them learn new skills and accelerate their careers in cloud computing and other cloud-enabled fields, including AI.

We are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to help 29 million people around the world grow their technology skills with free cloud computing skills training through AWS-designed programs by 2025. The trainings are designed to meet a wide variety of schedules, learning preferences, and career goals, offering something for everyone. Since 2020, Amazon and AWS have helped 21 million people globally gain access to these training opportunities.

# AWS supported upskilling initiatives through the following programs:

- AWS Cloud Institute, a new, structured, hands-on training program that helps learners launch their cloud careers in as little as one year—regardless of their technical background. The first AWS Cloud Institute cohort began classes in January 2024.
- AWS re/Start, a free-to-learner, cohort-based workforce development training program that helps unemployed or underemployed individuals with little or no tech experience build the skills needed for entry-level cloud careers. In 2023, AWS re/Start was delivered to more than 200 cities in 60 countries. Through this program, 90% of participants have been connected to job interview opportunities.
- AWS Skill Builder, an online learning center that offers more than 600 free, on-demand cloud courses in up to 17 languages. Skill Builder provides subscriptions with access to game-based learning, labs, scenario-based challenges, and practice exams for select AWS Certifications.

# Supporting Disaster Relief and Response Efforts

Amazon brings AWS cloud technology to areas hard-hit by natural disasters to support mapping, establish connectivity, and quickly increase capacity for emergency call centers. In 2023, AWS responded to 14 disasters and provided 103 affected business customers with $3.5 million worth of cloud credit donations to facilitate emergency services.

AWS also provided its technology to assist responders in Hawaii, helping coordinate support and make it possible for community members to contact loved ones following the historic wildfires in Maui.

Amazon committed more than $105 million through 2023 to help the people of Ukraine address both immediate and long-term needs. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine in 2022, we have continued to deliver timely and appropriate relief.

# Global disaster relief hubs

Global disaster relief hubs within our fulfillment centers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia form the backbone of our strategy. These hubs store ready-to-ship essential items that are most needed following natural disasters and other emergencies, including shelter and shelter-repair materials, hygiene supplies, medical equipment, and basic household items.

# Giving Back through Volunteering Efforts

Amazon encourages and enables our global teams to volunteer in their communities and support the causes they are passionate about. In 2023, over 170,000 volunteers from 54 countries participated in more than 25,000 events with more than 5,700 nonprofit and community organizations.

This included over 76,000 Amazon volunteers who joined our second Global Month of Volunteering. During this initiative, team members volunteered for more than 4,500 events supporting over 1,200 nonprofit and community organizations—cleaning up parks, donating school supplies and clothing to students, building houses for families experiencing homelessness, assembling wish boxes for kids, and delivering meals to local food banks.

# Addressing Health Equity

AWS is harnessing the power of the cloud to advance health equity globally. Through the AWS Health Equity Initiative (HEI), AWS has pledged to provide up to $60 million in cloud computing credits to organizations that are using cloud computing technology to address health disparities that impact underserved or underrepresented communities around the world. AWS has already awarded over $32 million and supported 229 global organizations to promote equal access to health resources, up from 90 organizations in 2022.

In December 2023, AWS joined the Health Electrification and Telecommunications Alliance (HETA), Power Africa’s initiative for health facility electrification and digital connectivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Power Africa is part of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and harnesses the collective resources of public and private sectors to expand electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. AWS has pledged to support efforts across the initiative’s target countries, contributing cash and AWS promotional credits to help health facilities keep the lights on for nighttime services, reliably provide patients with oxygen and other lifesaving care, refrigerate vaccines and other temperature-sensitive medical commodities, and use the digital tools that modern medicine relies on. AWS is also collaborating with HETA to develop a cloud-based solution for real-time monitoring, analytics, predictive maintenance of energy and connectivity infrastructure.

# Funding Nature in Our Communities

We use nature-based solutions to mitigate carbon emissions outside of our value chain and supplement the carbon reduction efforts we’re driving across our operations. One critical aspect of this work is our commitment to investing in initiatives that protect the natural world, improve wildlife habitats, and promote biodiversity.

|United Kingdom:|We funded the planting of approximately 450,000 trees across the country through the Woodland Trust’s Emergency Tree Fund.|
|---|---|
| |We also contributed funding for 22 nature restoration projects through the Mayor of London’s Rewild London Fund, in partnership with London Wildlife Trust and Groundwork London. These projects are protecting water voles, improving habitats for reptiles, and reintroducing beavers to West London for the first time in 400 years.|
|Ireland:|Amazon donated €2.5 million to The Nature Trust to help rehabilitate up to 500 hectares of degraded Atlantic blanket bog and restore it to a functioning peatland habitat.|
|United States:|Volunteers from Amazon helped restore Olympia oyster populations in the Puget Sound region of Washington. In 2022 and 2023, we committed $310,000 to the Puget Sound Restoration Fund to help plant more than 3 million oyster seeds.|
| |In California, Amazon donated $100,000 to The Bay Foundation to restore approximately 2.5 acres of giant kelp forests off the state’s southern coast.|
|The Netherlands:|Amazon granted €1.5 million to a consortium of partners headed by North Sea Farmers to develop the world’s first commercial-scale seaweed farm located between offshore wind turbines. The project will test methods of seaweed farming while researching the potential of seaweed to sequester carbon.|
|Asia-Pacific:|We announced $15 million for nature-based projects in the region, with the first $3 million allocated to India. Amazon will allocate the remainder of this funding to other key biodiversity and climate adaptation hotspots in the region.|
|India:|Amazon has committed 83 million INR ($1 million) to the Centre for Wildlife Studies to support communities and conservation efforts in the Western Ghats. This UNESCO World Heritage Site and critical wildlife conservation zone is home to wild Asian elephants and tigers.|
| |Amazon’s funding will expand the Wild Carbon project, which will enable 2,000 farmers and their households to plant up to 300,000 trees over three years.|
|Spain:|In partnership with CIFAL Málaga-UNITAR (the United Nations Institute for Training and Research), we launched the Green Helmets education initiative, designed to teach young people how to develop and implement nature conservation projects. Nearly 3,650 students from 60 schools in Andalusia completed the training and submitted project ideas that contribute to the recovery and protection of nature. Ten projects were selected to be developed in 2024, with each receiving €10,000 from the Right Now Climate Fund.|

The initiative also planted 20,000 trees and distributed more than 26,000 seed bombs, with drones distributing more than 400,000 seeds to 500 hectares of difficult-to-access areas in the Sierra Bermeja region that was recently devastated by wildfires.

# Looking Forward

As we move forward, Amazon aims to continue supporting the communities where we operate, focusing on the areas where we can make the biggest change: education, food security, disaster response, affordable housing equity, and health equity. Our goal is to keep using our infrastructure, technology, and passion for invention—along with the uniquely-Amazon skills and know-how of our global workforce—to unlock new opportunities for our communities across the globe.

# Employee Experience

# Our Approach

Amazon works hard to attract and recruit the best employees and create a valuable experience for them every day. We do this in part by listening to our employees to understand how we can design benefits that work for them and their families and that are optimized for affordability, flexibility, choice, and personalization. We strive to provide competitive and equitable compensation that rewards our employees for their achievements.

We also want our employees to have the opportunity to grow and thrive with us. As the skills needed for jobs in our sector rapidly evolve, we are preparing our employees by investing in training and development programs with real-world applications. We do this by analyzing the labor market to identify in-demand jobs and providing education and training—including through career coaching and our mentoring network—that reflect the skills needed to be successful in these roles.

In everything we do, we aim to create a culture of mutual respect and progress, underpinned by candid, constructive communication. We offer multiple ways to ensure employees’ voices are heard and that they can share concerns and ask questions, including our “open door” policy, whereby employees can reach out to anyone in management with suggestions, concerns, or feedback. Input from our employees, collected from multiple channels, is used to continuously improve our workplace.

# Our Benefits

We offer a range of benefits that support our employees and eligible family members, including their children and domestic partners. These comprehensive benefits begin on day one and include health care insurance coverage, paid parental leave, ways to save for the future, our upskilling programs, and other resources to improve health and well-being.

# Our Progress

# Compensation and Financial Support

Amazon provides competitive compensation to reward employees for their dedication and hard work. In 2023, we announced pay increases for U.S. frontline employees, with average pay for those in customer fulfillment and transportation increasing from $19 to $20.50 per hour—an investment of $1.3 billion. Our investments have had a positive influence on local communities across the U.S., helping to grow household incomes and boost local economies.

Amazon also invested $600 million in international wage increases in 2023. In the UK, we committed to investing £170 million to increase the minimum starting hourly wage for our frontline operations employees between October 2023 and April 2024. By the end of 2023, we had increased the hourly wage in the UK to £12, representing a 14% increase in starting pay over two years and a 26% increase since 2018.

In Germany, we increased the entry hourly wage for logistics employees to €14, representing a 17% increase in average starting pay since 2022 and a 30% increase since 2019. Hourly wages automatically increase in Germany after 12 and 24 months, with full-time employees earning an average of €37,000 per year after two years.

We also introduced a new financial assistance program and an emergency savings program with Brightside in 2023 to further support our customer fulfillment and transportation employees. Brightside is a financial care solution currently being piloted for hourly employees in select states across the U.S., providing free and confidential solutions to those experiencing financial challenges or looking to improve their financial health. Our Brightside Financial Care pilot program connects Amazon associates with financial solutions and resources that enhance their control over their personal finances. Personal coaches offer live support to participants and use dynamic technology to recommend customized plans to improve their financial health and maximize the benefits available to them through Amazon. In 2023, nearly 28,900 associates engaged in this pilot program across 12 states. We plan to expand the program to all U.S. hourly employees in 2024.

Meanwhile, Brightside’s emergency savings fund program enables employees to prepare for life’s unexpected expenses by building an emergency financial reserve. Participants can set aside a portion of their paycheck automatically and access the funds when they are most needed. Employees who take advantage of this benefit increase their financial resiliency and confidence each pay period as they see their savings account balance grow. Together, these programs have provided $13.9 million worth of financial resources to employees, helping them contribute $7.4 million to savings accounts that can be used for unexpected expenses.

# Robust and Inclusive Benefits

We offer a range of benefits that support our employees and eligible family members, including their children and domestic partners. For regular full-time and part-time employees, these benefits begin on the first day of employment and include health care insurance coverage, paid parental leave, ways to save for the future, our upskilling programs, and other resources to improve health and well-being. Recognizing that one size does not fit all, the program empowers employees to tailor their health and wellness benefits to align with their individual life stages and circumstances.

In 2023, Amazon invested nearly $10 billion in total employee benefits. To meet employees’ needs, no matter their circumstances, we continued to expand our current offerings and introduce new ones. For example:

- We launched Flexible Benefits in India and Canada, offering diverse employee cohorts the freedom to design their benefits packages to cater to their unique needs and those of their families. In India, we designed a Flexible Benefits program that effectively builds custom solutions for our diverse, multigenerational workforce.
- We launched new cross-border health plan options allowing employees who work in California to access health care in the Baja California region of Mexico.
- Compassionate care services—our support for employees and their dependents through difficult life events—were expanded beyond the U.S. to 60 new countries. These services include family bereavement support and free, confidential support to employees and their dependents who have been diagnosed with a critical or terminal illness.
- To make obtaining maintenance medication more convenient for employees and support regimen adherence, Amazon increased the number of U.S. pharmacies where employees can fill 90-day supplies.
- We provided access to mental health counselors via live chat for employees in Australia, Costa Rica, India, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK. We also completed the global rollout of our partnership with Twill Therapeutics, which provides self-guided tools for everyday mental health to employees and their families.

# Pay Equity

We continue to prioritize pay equity among our employees. A review of our 2023 compensation, including base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, found that women in the U.S. earned 99.9 cents and women globally earned 99.8 cents for every dollar men earned performing the same jobs. The review also showed that racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. earned one dollar for every dollar white employees earned performing the same jobs.

# Global Employee Assistance Program

Alongside robust medical care, Amazon offers inclusive mental health support, including through our Employee Assistance Program. Amazon solicits ongoing feedback from our workforce and input from external partners to help ensure our health and wellness benefits meet the evolving needs of all employees. For example, in 2023, we generally aligned our U.S. gender-affirming coverage with recommendations from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.

# Inclusive Experiences

Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP—available through our partnership with Resources for Living in the U.S., Telus Health in Canada, Laya Healthcare in Ireland, and Workplace Options in all other countries—is a global benefit for employee health and wellness for mental health questions or concerns. It is designed to be an essential resource for employees and their families seeking day-to-day guidance or support.

From day one of their employment, employees have access to the EAP. It is available 24/7 in most major world languages, 100% confidential, and free of charge, with easily accessible services including:

- Counseling delivered by qualified mental health professionals, either in-the-moment—when it is needed most—or through bookable, short-term, solutions-focused counseling designed to help with a particular issue.
- Dedicated pediatric program, delivering mental health support for children from 18 months old and their caregivers.
- Financial and legal wellness consultations.
- Personalized mindfulness, life, and wellness coaching program.
- Validated referrals for external work/life services.
- Manager consultation services, including critical incident support.
- Range of self-serve assessment tools and access to a topical webinar and information library via a customized website or app.
- Access to behavioral health care, including five visits per issue per year (expanded from three visits in 2022).

In 2023, Amazon’s Workplace Options EAP was offered in 59 countries, including four new ones: Estonia, Hungary, India, and Kenya. Globally, our EAP was available to nearly 1.6 million employees in 62 countries.

# Supporting the Health of Amazon Employees and Their Families

Navigating health care for family planning and fertility can be challenging, which is why Amazon proudly provides our U.S. employees—regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, or relationship status—with family-building benefits. This benefit offers support with in vitro fertilization (IVF), egg freezing, genetic testing, and more, and it supported nearly 30,400 full-time and hourly Amazon employees in 2023. Through this offering, our U.S. employees also receive access to approximately 1,070 fertility specialists. In 2023, Amazon received the National Infertility Association’s Award for Access, which recognizes companies whose work helps increase access to family-building options for people living with infertility.

When our employees are facing challenging times in terms of their health, we strive to be there to support them. In 2023, we signed the Working with Cancer Pledge to signify our continued commitment to providing a supportive workplace culture for employees with cancer. This pledge signals Amazon’s dedication to providing leading health care benefits and fostering compassion among managers and leaders across the company.

# Workforce Changes

In January 2023, Amazon announced the difficult decision to eliminate 18,000 roles, with an additional 9,000 roles eliminated in April 2023. Several of our businesses were affected by these decisions. We did not make these decisions lightly and were committed to providing support to ease the transition out of Amazon. Employees whose roles were eliminated received a separation payment, external job placement support, and region-specific transitional health insurance benefits, where applicable.

# Employee Engagement in Sustainability

In 2023, Amazon launched the Sustainable Amazonian (SAM) program to engage our corporate employees worldwide in adopting more sustainable practices, both in their day-to-day jobs and outside of work. Approximately 7,540 employees signed the SAM Pledge, which included making a commitment to leave things better than they found them and completing a sustainability training. Through Amazon’s Sustainability Ambassador program, operational employees across our business support sustainability projects—both on-site at Amazon campuses and in their communities—as well as employee engagement reporting and educational events to inspire fellow employees and share best practices across teams, business units, and locations. Nearly 9,300 employees participated in our Sustainability Ambassador program in 2023, spanning 24 chapters throughout 1,345 of our buildings in our corporate, data center, and fulfillment networks.

Examples of 2023 employee-led projects include:

- Sustainability Ambassadors established a waste diversion program for our EU Logistics organization that reduced waste by 1.4 grams per dispatched shipment, for a total of 6 tons of waste avoided. The team’s waste avoidance projects helped us divert 88% of waste from landfills in 2023.
- AWS Sustainability Ambassadors continued their implementation of the LED Everywhere Project, an initiative started in 2021 that aims to replace fluorescent or less energy-efficient lighting with LED alternatives in all AWS data centers. In 2023, 10,500 light bulbs were replaced with LEDs, resulting in an energy use reduction of over 3,100 megawatt-hours (MWh) annually compared to the old bulbs.
- In the U.S., Sustainability Ambassadors partnered with the Indigenous at Amazon global affinity group and Amazon in the Community to host an in-person panel discussion with internationally recognized Indigenous leaders at our Seattle headquarters. Their discussion linked Indigenous wisdom, knowledge, and learnings to global sustainability efforts, with a focus on protecting our water resources.

The education of our employees is an important piece of our work to drive a culture that prioritizes sustainability across Amazon. In 2023, nearly 51,300 employees engaged in sustainability education, and approximately 31,680 voluntarily completed internal sustainability training modules.

# Upskilling Our Employees

We are empowering our employees to build the skills they need to remain competitive, grow their careers, and move into higher-paying roles. In the process, we’re building a strong pipeline of talent to fill current and future in-demand jobs, both at Amazon and beyond.

Central to our upskilling efforts is our pledge to invest $1.2 billion to provide prepaid education and technical skills training to over 300,000 of our U.S. employees by 2025. We achieved this goal by the end of 2023—with approximately 358,180 U.S. employees participating in our upskilling programs. Career Choice, our longest-standing program, has provided job training to more than 175,000 employees worldwide since it launched in 2012, a 62% increase from 110,000 in 2022. In 2023, Surge2IT, a program to help entry-level IT employees across Amazon’s operations pursue careers in higher-paying technical roles, merged into Career Choice.

# Employee Communication

Many of our best ideas come from Amazon employees. We value their feedback—both positive sentiments and constructive comments that can help us improve the employee and customer experiences.

Amazon uses various communication channels to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to changing dynamics, questions, concerns, and ideas across our large global workforce. This includes direct daily engagement, such as all-hands meetings with general managers, stand-up meetings with direct supervisors, and other one-on-one meetings.

Using the MyVoice mechanism, we continuously improve our policies and practices based on workers’ suggestions. For example, direct suggestions relating to time-tracking led to policy improvements that better served associate needs, provided increased flexibility, and allowed for better work/life balance.

At one fulfillment center in California, we received MyVoice feedback regarding difficulty in commuting to the location. Taking this feedback into account, Amazon partnered with city and local officials to provide a better bus route and stop that would help alleviate the issue. Meanwhile, in India, leaders analyzed feedback from associates related to leave management, resulting in the launch of a new, automatic, end-to-end leave management system, improved standardization, and, as a result, a better associate experience.

# Associate Roundtables, Forums, and Safety Committees

Globally, Amazon applies or is party to dozens of collective bargaining agreements at national, regional, sectoral, and enterprise levels. In 2022, we established a European Works Council, holding our first meeting in April 2023. The European Works Council is composed of workers and employer representatives and meets regularly to discuss transnational company issues.

Associate Roundtables provide employees and managers with a meaningful opportunity to discuss issues, ask questions, and get immediate feedback in person. Amazon hosts these meetings around the globe, with their exact cadence varying by business line and site. In 2023, we held 146 Associate Forums.

Associate Safety Committees allow employees at various sites globally to offer input on relevant safety matters. In 2023, 185,000 employees participated in over 25,000 Safety Committee meetings, collectively developing 13,000 actions to increase on-site safety.

# Looking Forward

Amazon is always exploring new ways to enhance the employee experience. We will continue focusing on upward mobility by offering technical and skills training for career advancement and encouraging participation in our Career Choice program, which provides employees the opportunity to get prepaid college, GED, or English as a second language (ESL) tuition.

Finally, as we strive to be Earth’s best employer, we’ll seek to further integrate flexibility into how and when our employees work and will continue to offer competitive compensation, financial support, and benefits. We’re eager to keep improving our employee engagement efforts and build even more robust feedback mechanisms to ensure that our global workforce feels valued, heard, and appreciated.

# MyVoice

MyVoice, Amazon’s primary Voice of Associate platform, provides a two-way communication channel between our global associates and their site leadership. This online tool allows employees to express concerns, offer suggestions, and ask questions to leadership teams who will reply directly, enabling quicker, more collaborative issue remediation.

Globally, employees provided over 600,000 comments through MyVoice in 2023. Connections is Amazon’s real-time, companywide feedback mechanism designed to facilitate listening to and learning from employees at scale. Each day, employees can choose to respond to Connections questions—delivered in 29 languages—via their computers, workstation devices, or hand scanners.

Connections improves the employee experience by identifying obstacles to meaningful work, surfacing issues before they become acute problems, and highlighting strengths so they don’t become missed opportunities. Across Amazon, our employees generate more than 1.6 million Connections responses across 60 countries each day.

# Appeals

Amazon maintains a defined appeals process for our employees. Across the U.S. and Canada, eligible employees can use an online, paperless appeals service to challenge certain disciplinary actions. The applicable manager reviews the claim to verify policies have been correctly applied. Where this is not the case, appropriate remediation can then be taken.

# Freedom of Association

We respect freedom of association and our employees’ right to form, join, or not join labor unions or other lawful organizations of their choosing without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. These rights should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner.

Amazon’s people are the heart and soul of our operations and the reason that safety is integral to everything we do. We strive to be the safest place to work in the industries in which we operate, and we’re committed to making sure our employees’ health and well-being are prioritized. We are continuously working to enhance our safety processes, leveraging technology to reduce risk, investing in areas where we must improve, partnering with others, and listening to our employees. The meaningful progress we’ve made so far would not be possible without the combined efforts of our more than 9,000 dedicated safety professionals and every one of our employees around the world.

At the Amazon European Operations Innovation Lab, employees test and develop future technologies to help enhance safety at our facilities in Europe.

# Our Approach

Our Leadership Principle “Strive to Be Earth’s Best Employer” challenges us to create a safer, more productive, higher-performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. It reinforces that nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of our teams.

We aim to be the safest workplace in the industries in which we operate. To drive continuous improvement, we measure progress against both lagging indicators, such as incident rates, and leading indicators, such as employee sentiment. We have safety audits, inspections, and feedback mechanisms in place at every Amazon facility. Together, these steps provide us with a full picture of our workplace safety.

A risk management approach guides our prioritization and decision-making. It includes:

- Engaging employees to continuously improve safety in our operations.
- Assessing safety processes and adherence to standards through audits and inspections.
- Measuring safety performance to assess program effectiveness and identify and remove hazards.
- Working with our operations partners to enhance safety across our network.
- Making targeted investments to enhance our safety performance.

# Supporting Our Operations and Workforce Safety

Creating a culture where every employee feels engaged and empowered is essential to providing and maintaining a safe environment. We have established a series of feedback mechanisms to ensure we listen to our people on the front lines and incorporate their feedback on ways to improve safety across our operations.

# Training Our Employees

Training is foundational to safety excellence. We are constantly updating and enhancing our suite of trainings to ensure they are effective and helpful for employees.

Onboarding: All applicable new employees receive safety training on their first day of employment. In 2023, all of our newly hired operations employees took our safety onboarding training. This covers ownership of safety, incident reporting and investigation, stop work authority, awareness for all safety procedures, and an introduction to the safety management system.

Annual Training: Every employee and manager participates in annual safety training, which reinforces concepts such as emergency preparedness and response, hazards and controls of the specific jobs they are doing, safety coaching, identifying and reporting unsafe conditions and behaviors, and safety engagement.

# Safety Observations

One method we use to take employee feedback and turn it into measurable action is Dragonfly. This tool—available on employees’ devices and at kiosks on-site—empowers employees to find and fix unsafe conditions or behaviors, escalate safety concerns, and suggest safety improvements during the course of their work. Dragonfly informs site managers so they can take appropriate action. In 2023, we successfully actioned over 200,000 Dragonfly observations to help make our sites safer.

# Safety Committees

Throughout 2023, more than 185,000 employees participated in over 25,000 safety meetings whose purpose was to gather feedback, describe new safety initiatives, and listen to employee needs. These meetings resulted in more than 13,000 follow-up actions, including simple items like readjusting site mirrors to better align with walking paths and sharing reminders on how to safely move pallets.

# Mixed Reality Training

Beyond routine training, we invest in new technologies to continuously build safety skills and competencies. We are piloting promising mixed reality training for some higher-risk jobs to simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled, safe environment. For example, we are testing a semi-immersive training approach.

# 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Employee Experience

# Health and Safety

Using 3D headsets to simulate their jobs, operators learn how to pick orders in a safe and efficient way before starting their roles. Our Recordable Incident Rate (RIR) improved by 27%, but they still make up about 57% of all recordable injuries at Amazon. The remaining 43% of our recordable injuries were due to slips, trips, and falls, or occasional objects that came loose and fell.

While we still have work to do, we have made significant progress on safety since 2019. From the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2023, our global Recordable Incident Rate (RIR) improved by 30% and our Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) improved by 60%. These safety improvements came in the face of particularly tumultuous world events, including a pandemic that disrupted operations for almost every employer. Amazon’s safety performance continues to improve year over year—from 2022 to 2023, we improved our RIR by 8% and our LTIR by 16%. We are pleased with our progress but know we can do more. Each incident that occurs represents a person, and even one incident is too many.

# Our Partners

Our delivery network is powered by thousands of small businesses and hundreds of thousands of drivers who leverage Amazon’s technology to improve on-road safety every day. While our partners each provide robust programs for their drivers, we offer additional safety resources and training for any delivery partner who wants to participate. For example, to help drivers practice how to navigate safely in a variety of weather conditions, we created a commercial driver simulator program that includes advanced simulations of potential ice, snow, heavy rain, wind, mechanical challenges, and tire failures.

# Examining Injuries at Amazon Facilities

In addition to looking at overall injury rates, we believe it is important to examine the types and frequency of injuries to help us prevent incidents from occurring in the first place. That is why we rigorously audit and inspect our sites to make sure our resources and protocols are helping us effectively identify, eliminate, or reduce safety hazards. In 2023, we conducted almost 6.3 million inspections within our operations facilities globally, a 152% increase from the 2.5 million conducted in 2020. We audited 240 sites across Amazon.

These inspections and audits help us determine how to address the various types of injury. One of the most common types of injury at any warehousing or transportation company is a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD), more commonly known as a strain or sprain. Over the past four years, the rate of recordable MSD injuries at Amazon has improved. Our global operations network more than doubled in size between 2019 and 2023 to more than 1.1 million employees across thousands of sites.

# Evaluating Our Safety Performance

In the General Warehousing and Storage industry, our RIR improved by 24% over the past four years. Amazon’s 2023 rate is 6.5, which is better than the latest BLS average of 6.8 for employers our size (>1,000 employees). Our LTIR improved by 77% over the past four years. Amazon’s 2023 rate is 1.1, which is better than the latest BLS average of 2.6 for employers our size.

Employees work together to load packages.

Our progress is the result of investments of more than $1 billion in safety initiatives, technologies, and programs since 2019. We have also continued to invest in robotics that help make our operations safer by reducing employees’ workloads. One example is Proteus, our first autonomous mobile robot, which helps move heavy objects and carts. Another is Cardinal, a robotic arm that can quickly select a single package, read its label, and sort it. Both innovations help reduce repetitive tasks that can cause injuries such as MSDs and create a safer, more comfortable work environment for our employees year-round. We also plan for factors that can impact our employees’ safety such as extreme weather. Our policies and procedures for addressing extreme heat and cold are robust and often exceed industry standards and guidelines.

We are proud of our advancements in automation, and we supplement this sophisticated technology with well-known forms of personal protection. For example, we require all employees, partners, and visitors to wear safety shoes at our facilities, as well as hard hats and impact-resistant gloves in specific jobs. Mandating composite-toe safety shoes at our facilities has helped reduce toe-related injuries by 85% since 2022. We provide employees with a $110 voucher annually to acquire approved composite-toe shoes that fit their style and needs.

In addition, we have developed cutting-edge protective equipment for specific jobs. For example, we have developed intelligent safety vests for employees who maintain our robots. These vests use short-range radio frequencies to send signals to robots in real time. Robots in range automatically slow down, alter their route, and, at even closer range, stop entirely when they detect an employee is nearby. Once the employee is out of range, the robot resumes normal operation. As another example, we use sensor technology embedded in cold weather gear for employees who work in our freezers, allowing us to keep an eye on the amount of time they spend working in cooler temperatures. If an employee exceeds a specified amount of time, site personnel...

# Health and Safety

receive a real-time alert to check on the employee and encourage them to take a break. Since introducing this technology in 2022, we have not had a single recordable injury related to overexposure in freezers.

While our partners report their own safety data to regulators, we are committed to helping them keep their employees safe. To that end, we offer them access to safety resources, training, and technologies. One example is third-party technology in delivery vans that measures and monitors unsafe driving behaviors such as speeding, distraction, and failure to wear a seat belt or obey a road sign. If the technology consistently detects these behaviors, drivers receive a notification when they stop their vehicle for their next delivery. The technology also sends related notifications to the drivers’ employers—the DSPs—who are encouraged to coach the drivers. Since we have incorporated this technology into our branded vehicles, DSP drivers’ collision rates have declined nearly 40%. From 2022 to 2023, its use has reduced unsafe DSP driving behaviors by 62% in the U.S.

# Looking Forward

We made meaningful, measurable progress in 2023, and we are working hard to build on those achievements. While we’re proud of the progress we have made, we know that there is more work to do on our journey to become the safest employer in the industries in which we operate, and this drives our commitment to continue improving safety for our employees, partners, and communities every day.

# Working with Our Operations Partners

Within our operations network, we work with partners around the world to deliver packages to our customers safely and efficiently. For example, we collaborate with small business owners called delivery service providers (DSPs) and with independent contractors called Amazon Flex delivery partners to deliver packages to customers’ doorsteps. We also work with independent long-haul trucking companies to move products across our network.

# Freight Network

Our trucking fleet of company-owned and independent long-haul vehicles has advanced safety technology including front-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, stability control, side-object detection, adaptive cruise control, and speed limiters. Drivers in North America and Europe receive enhanced and up-to-date route forecasts to help them stay informed of inclement weather. The information can be accessed at any time, and forecasts are updated every 10 minutes to help them alter their route if needed. Drivers in North America also receive automated warnings if the technology detects their vehicle is stopped on a major road. The technology urges them to move to a safer location, if possible.

As the weather gets warmer, preparedness and prevention are paramount to the health and safety of our operations teams and delivery partners. In advance of higher temperatures, we use best-in-class technology, amenities, and preventive measures to help keep drivers safe. For example, all Amazon-branded vehicles are equipped with air conditioning—a feature that is well above industry standards. We are also on track to retrofit our full fleet of cargo vans and electric delivery vehicles with insulation that reduces the internal temperature of the back of our vehicles by up to 15% by the end of 2024.

Increasingly, more package deliveries are made overnight, when traffic is lighter and drivers can more safely navigate across communities. In 2023, we created an in-app safety feature that allows drivers to message customers and remind them to turn on porch lights, secure pets, and clear the pathway of hazards. We have also piloted a safe and non-intrusive Dog-Distancing Device—a hand-held unit with ultrasonic sounds and strobe lights that drivers can use when they come in contact with an animal at a delivery location. The device is intended to distract aggressive dogs and help delivery drivers create space between themselves and the animals when needed. Based on initial success, we have expanded the test to deploy the devices to the drivers who most frequently report encountering dogs during their deliveries.

We offer our freight partners access to safety resources, training, and technologies to keep their employees safe.

Our Approach

We believe the best way to enable enduring inclusive experiences is through technology. We are evolving our approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work by shifting to a more scalable, long-term view through three new mental models. This new strategy enables us to accelerate progress on our priorities and create inclusive experiences at scale. The mental models that guide our work are:

- Bolted-on DEI programs, which drive inclusive and equitable outcomes within our business operations. An example of a bolted-on program is diversity training, which teaches our employees to take more intentionally inclusive actions at work.
- Built-in solutions, which are embedded into existing products to drive equitable experience and outcomes. For example, the captions and dialogue boosts in Prime Video are built-in solutions, which create a more accessible experience for customers who are hard of hearing.
- Born-inclusive solutions, which we define as building equity and inclusion into the architecture of a product or technology from the start. Examples of this include aspects of product design, such as accessibility.

More built-in and born-inclusive solutions will be required to accelerate progress on our priorities and create inclusive experiences at scale.

Learn more about Amazon’s approach to inclusion on our global DEI website.

# Our Progress

As we deliver on our goals and make progress on our priority commitments, we continue reaching across cultures to connect our diverse world. We use our size, speed, and innovation to unite us in new and exciting ways, incorporating inclusion into everything we do.

# Building Equity and Inclusion into Our Talent Management

We continue to diversify our workforce, inspect outcomes of our talent strategies, and experiment with initiatives that foster a diverse talent pipeline and improve the experience for employees—from being hired, to successful onboarding, to career development.

# Building a Diverse Pipeline of Talent

Amazon’s ambition is for our employee population to represent the diverse communities we serve. As part of our efforts, we are building a strong pipeline of emerging diverse talent through educational programs.

Throughout 2023, Black, Latino/e, and women senior leaders across Amazon partnered with our hiring teams to support the continuous expansion of our external talent networks by investing in conferences and organizations such as Afro Tech, Association of Latino Professionals for America (ALPFA), Black Men Xcel, Latinas in Tech, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and Women in Tech. Amazon senior leaders participated in roundtable discussions and network-building and affinity-based events, and they engaged in recruiting partnerships—all to increase brand awareness, engage diverse talent, and drive expanded interaction with prospective external employees and leaders.

# Developing Diverse Talent

Employees can also participate in networking programs that organize learning opportunities, lead service projects, and host activities around cultural celebrations. In 2023, nearly 148,200 employees across more than 2,500 chapters in 60 countries participated in one or more of our affinity groups.

AWS employees can take part in the Inclusive Ambassador program, which is dedicated to scaling an inclusive, fair, and respectful culture at AWS. More than 19,000 AWS employees across 52 chapters globally participated in the Inclusive Ambassador program in 2023.

# Refugees and Humanitarian-Based Immigrants

As part of our efforts to be Earth’s best employer, we welcome refugees and immigrants into our workforce and support their transition to their new communities. In 2022, we announced a goal to hire at least 5,000 refugees in the U.S. by the end of 2024—and we achieved this in 2023.

# Women at Amazon

Amazon celebrates women around the world and aims to inspire the next generation of women in tech. We advocate for gender diversity, equal opportunities, and inclusive spaces for women to thrive and feel comfortable at work and beyond.

To support this hiring commitment, in 2023, we expanded our Welcome Door program, which offers resources and support for refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant employees in the U.S., to Germany, Poland, and Australia. Benefits vary by country (based on need) but may include financial reimbursement for immigration-related processes, free legal resources to help navigate immigration-related questions, the option to connect with immigration experts, access to upskilling opportunities, and customized mentorship.

In 2023, our Women at Amazon affinity group hosted development programs across Amazon, such as its Sponsorship and Promotion Accelerating Readiness and Know-How (SPARK) initiative. This program offers employees access to formal training and development, influence and advocacy, networking opportunities with senior leaders, and targeted, actionable coaching. In 2023, SPARK onboarded 300 participants across eight countries.

We also focus on investing in women as community members that contribute to industry innovation through initiatives that help close funding gaps. For example, in 2023, we held our first-ever AWS Startups Women’s Demo Week, a global event helping women-led startups connect with investors. Additionally, we are committed to supporting women climate tech entrepreneurs through The Climate Pledge Fund’s Female Founder Initiative. In 2023, the Female Founder Initiative invested in Genecis, a bioplastics company founded by scientist Luna Yu.

# People with Disabilities at Amazon

Amazon works to foster a workplace culture that is safe, welcoming, and inclusive to people with disabilities. We continue to provide resources to advance disability inclusion globally, such as our AmazonPwD affinity group and leadership tools to support employees with disabilities.

We are proud of the awards and recognitions we received in 2023 as an inclusive and accessible employer for people with disabilities. For the second year in a row, we earned a top score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index, which is a joint initiative of the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), the nation’s largest disability rights organization, and Disability:IN, the leading global business disability inclusion network, which collectively advances the inclusion of people with disabilities.

In 2023, the UK government’s Disability Confident employer program recognized Amazon as a Level 3 Leader, the highest level of accreditation. Developed by employers and organizations that represent people living with disabilities, this program encourages employers to think differently about disability and improve how they recruit, retain, and develop talent within their organizations. In India, we received the government’s National Award for Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.

# Veterans and Military Spouses at Amazon

We recognize the diverse backgrounds and experiences that veterans and military spouses bring to Amazon, as well as how they strengthen our workforce. Amazon partners across business lines to host hiring events, such as Amazon Military Hiring Days and virtual information sessions.

Amazon hired over 100,400 veterans and spouses through January 2024, achieving our goal to hire 100,000 veterans and spouses by July 2024. At the end of 2023, Amazon employed 98,500 veterans and military spouses, based on data from countries where employees can identify themselves as such. In addition, our veteran retention and promotion rates outpaced those of non-veterans.

# Indigenous Communities

Amazon is committed to supporting Indigenous leaders and creating solutions to help close educational and professional gaps among members of Indigenous communities. Our first-ever Amazon online storefront in support of Indigenous communities in Canada was launched in 2023. The storefront benefited 13 Indigenous artists/authors and three nonprofits that lead important work for Indigenous communities across Canada.

Learn more about our Board diversity data in our Sustainability Reporting Framework Summary.

* In late 2021, we began allowing employees to identify as multiple specific races or ethnicities and updated our race/ethnicity reporting to begin counting multiracial employees under each separate group with which they identify. As such, category data may not add up to 100% exactly. We also count employees as they currently identify, both for race and ethnicity and for gender. Therefore, when an employee updates their identification, Amazon counts that employee according to their new identification at all times in their career at Amazon, which may change historic data and reporting. Data in this report reflects employee identification as of December 31, 2023.

† In 2023, Amazon updated reporting to include directly employed seasonal and temporary Field and Customer Support workers as well as all employees in the Audible, Twitch, and MGM subsidiaries. Additionally, reporting has been updated to reflect the distinct Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) category. Moving forward this group is reported separately from Native American/Alaskan.

# Supporting Black, Latino, and Diverse Businesses

Amazon is committed to supporting Black, Latino, and diverse businesses and wants to see them succeed. We deliver and invest in tools and resources that empower business owners to grow and, in turn, create positive impact in their local communities.

In 2023, as part of our efforts to boost and support early-stage, Black, Latino, and other underrepresented entrepreneurs, Amazon Catalytic Capital invested in six new venture capital funds. Catalytic Capital is a $150 million fund committed to investing in venture capital funds, accelerators, incubators, and venture studios that support Black, Latino, and other historically underrepresented entrepreneurs. These new investments helped us meet our goal to support 10 funds and accelerators and, in turn, fund 200 companies by the end of 2023.

# Accelerating Equitable Health Research

Many communities are currently underrepresented in medical research. As a result, less is known about their health and ways to provide them with the best care. In September 2023, we began a partnership with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to raise awareness of their All of Us Research Program, an effort to collect and study data from people living in the U.S. to build one of the most diverse health databases in history.

This initiative focuses on accelerating precision medicine research, increasing health equity, and providing DNA results to participants. In support of this work, All of Us works closely with organizations with deep ties to communities that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research.

We were NIH’s first corporate health equity partner. In 2023, more than 1,300 Amazon employees have either visited the All of Us website or interacted directly with All of Us staff to learn more about the program, and more than 200 Amazon employees have participated in this landmark study. Of the participants who joined a kickoff event at our second corporate headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, 79% are from communities that have been historically underrepresented in biomedical research.

# Advancing DEI through Technology

Amazon is creating inclusive technology that connects our diverse world, disrupting the status quo of how we learn, communicate, and live. We continue to build and expand accessibility features in our products, from Alexa and Fire TV to Audible and Prime Video. For example, we offer Alexa Voice Service (AVS) to commercial device makers such as original design manufacturers and systems integrators, who use it to build Alexa into smart speakers, headphones, PCs, TVs, vehicles, and smart home products.

We also launched Voice Access, a new accessibility feature for our Fire HD 10, in October 2023. Voice Access allows customers who can speak English, but cannot use their hands to touch the screen, to control their Fire tablet with their voice.

# Learn more about our efforts to support diverse businesses

We are also creating opportunities for alignment with the greater community through programs such as our Black Business Accelerator (BBA), which was launched in 2021 as our first growth accelerator. Backed by a $150 million commitment from Amazon over four years, the BBA is dedicated to assisting Black-owned businesses in building sustainable growth on Amazon’s store. It provides a range of comprehensive educational, discoverability, and community resources for certified Black-owned U.S. businesses with professional seller accounts at our store. In 2023, the BBA provided 274 businesses with account management and financial assistance to accelerate their journey to launch and scale their businesses.

# Inclusive Experiences

To further bridge the digital divide for people with disabilities, in November 2023, we announced a partnership with The Arc, an organization serving people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. As part of this partnership, we are donating 1,505 Echo Show and Fire tablet devices to 39 chapters of The Arc across the U.S.

# Looking Forward

The opportunity ahead of us to incorporate inclusion into everything we do at Amazon is greater than ever. The industry is at a unique inflection point where technology is rapidly progressing and the landscape for how we work is changing. In order to accelerate our DEI priorities, we are implementing born-inclusive standards across everything we do—equity and inclusion are being built into the architecture of our products, talent strategies, and initiatives for employees, customers, and communities around the globe.

Amazon has changed the world through our innovations, and we’re committed to delivering inclusive experiences through technology in the same way: by disrupting the status quo and uniting us in new and exciting ways.

# STEM Educational Opportunities

Amazon is working to build a pipeline of Indigenous STEM talent. In 2023, we sponsored Indigenous in AI’s annual Lakota AI Code Camp. This three-week camp introduces Lakota youth to coding and combines Lakota culture with AI to foster the preservation and reinvigoration of the Lakota language.

We also awarded scholarships totaling $500,000 to 125 students through AmazonNext, a college partnership program supporting undergraduate students in pursuing STEM majors. Additionally, our Amazon Future Engineer program continues to provide access to childhood-to-career computer science education, focusing on students from underrepresented and historically disenfranchised people and communities.

In 2023, Amazon Fire TV expanded its audio streaming capabilities for hearing aids and devices to include cochlear implants. For the first time, people with hearing loss can stream sound directly from their Amazon smart TVs to their cochlear hearing implants via the open-source Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids protocol. This latest innovation was built in partnership with customers and members of the AmazonPwD employee affinity group who use cochlear implants.

We have the world’s largest catalog of movies with additional spoken audio, which describes what is happening on screen, making it easier for our customers who identify as blind or visually impaired to enjoy their favorite Prime content. By the end of 2023, Prime users had access to over 5,750 audio-described movies and nearly 1,300 audio-described television series.

In 2023, Amazon Music and Amazon MGM Studios partnered to create more inclusive experiences for customers who identify as deaf, disabled, or neurodiverse. For example, the teams introduced American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters from marginalized communities on Amazon Music Live concerts after Thursday Night Football, creating a more inclusive experience for performing artists, interpreters, and customers.

# Innovating for Customer Fulfillment and Transportation Employees

Amazon is developing new technologies that help our customer fulfillment and transportation employees connect, learn, and communicate at their place of work. For example, in 2023, more than 450,000 employees in our customer fulfillment centers used SayHi, a tool to facilitate communication among colleagues facing language barriers. Through SayHi, employees can access 72 languages and 114 dialects to eliminate linguistic obstacles and engage in multilingual conversations without the need for dedicated translators.

Business Disability Forum, a UK-based disability inclusion organization, honored Amazon with the Disability Smart Technology Award in 2023. This award recognizes our work to develop technology that improves the lives and experiences of people living with disabilities. The judges noted the breadth of our innovation and global reach, as well as our use of employee and customer feedback to inform the design, development, and delivery of our products and services.

# Sustainability Reporting Topic Assessment

Amazon’s business spans many industries, including but not limited to e-commerce, cloud computing, consumer goods, food and beverage, and logistics. This broad scope means we identify environmental, social, and governance topics and focus our efforts by assessing our business holistically. In 2022, Amazon conducted a comprehensive analysis to inform the sustainability topics that are relevant to our reporting.

To guide our analysis, we leveraged Datamaran, a business intelligence platform, referencing data-driven insights from leading reporting frameworks, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The platform also analyzed the regulatory landscape, media, and company reports to inform the topics. We also consulted with key stakeholders, including internal decision-makers, employees, partner organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and academics, to capture their input and broad range of perspectives.
