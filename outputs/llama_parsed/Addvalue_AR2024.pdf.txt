# CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

# RICHARD DENNY

Non-Executive Chairman

“We enter this next financial year in a far healthier position than has been the case for some time. Our confirmed order book of some US$9 million across both the SPC and ADR business segments is most encouraging and we are as well broadening and strengthening our customer base.”

# DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS

It gives me great pleasure to report on the performance of the Company in this my second year as Chairman. On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), I hereby present to you the Annual Report of Addvalue Technologies Ltd (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 (“FY2024”).

# FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

The Group recorded a 69% growth in revenue to US$12.8 million in FY2024 from US$7.5 million in FY2023. The increase was mainly attributable to better sales from SPC-Related Business and ADR-Related Business. Our SPC-Related business delivered 27 IDRS terminals in FY2024 against the 19 terminals in FY2023, an increase by 8 terminals or 42%. The IDRS terminals revenue recorded a 50.3% growth from US$4.4 million in FY2023 to US$6.6 million in FY2024 as we delivered higher value terminals in FY2024. In addition, our cumulative recurring airtime revenue from the provisioning of IDRS data connection services grew by about 12% to US$617K in FY2024 from US$550K in FY2023. Equally, our ADR-Related business grew significantly by 99% to US$4.8 million in FY2024 from US$2.4 million in FY2023 as our continual development in improving our ADR products yielded encouraging results.

To recap, as a result of our well-conceived pivoting towards solution-centric business models in the recent formative years, our twin engines of growth of SPC-Related Business and ADR-Related Business are expected to enjoy continued growth in the next few years.

# FINANCIAL POSITION

To further strengthen the financial position of the Group and for additional working capital requirements in anticipation of our business expansion, the Company had further completed a fund raising exercise in early 2024 to raise about S$1.0 million via the issuance of 78,500,000 Cumulative Loan Notes with Detachable Warrants at $0.013 each. As at 31 March 2024, the Group’s has a working capital position of US$2.9 million versus US$2.2 million as at 31 March 2023. Net asset backing per Share improved to 0.19 US cent as at 31 March 2024 from 0.18 US cent as at 31 March 2023.

# CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

# LOOKING FORWARD

The FY2024 results provide clear confirmation that the measures and strategic changes which have been introduced over these past several years are now demonstrating the anticipated outcomes. It was always expected that such changes would not reap overnight rewards and that the process required time, focus and ongoing commitment by all. It has therefore been very satisfying to experience the increasingly wider adoption of the solutions we provide across the SPC-Related Business and the ADR-Related Business: expand and innovate. Such processes have seen new satellites being designed and launched, new LEO constellations being prepared for testing and service introduction and a wide range of new applications being implemented, including climate change, advanced communications needs, geopolitical events, strategic opportunities and commercial developments. We believe the IDRS is well poised to take full advantage of the potential of this new market segment of the space industry.

# 1. SPC-Related Business (referencing our IDRS product and associated services):

a. The traditional means by which Low Orbit Earth (“LEO”) satellite operators have connected with their in-orbit spacecraft is via a number of ground station antennae positioned around the world and providing line of sight connectivity. Given that the fast-moving satellites provide a very limited connectivity window, measured in minutes, to any single point on earth, the LEO operator has traditionally required a large number of ground stations to provide extended periods of connectivity. This inherent design is thus costly to establish and to maintain over the long term, as well as being severely limited in functionality for the increasing reliance on constant and near realtime data. Today LEO satellite operators need much better data communications technologies to overcome such inflexible and expensive ground station architecture.

b. From the time of the launch of the first commercial LEO satellite equipped with IDRS, in late 2020, we have continued to provide the only data communications solution capable of providing almost-real-time, always-on, any time and in any geographical location two-way data connectivity to LEO satellites. We achieve this through our partnership with Inmarsat/Viasat and via the sophisticated BGAN geostationary satellite network. The satellite industry has, throughout FY2024, continued to develop,

c. The range of IDRS customers that have been publicly announced with their consents has now been expanded to include, amongst others, such respected operators as Capella Space, iQPS, VAST Space, Synspective, Atomos Space, Astroscale and Space Inventor. They represent a spread of LEO satellite technologies for a wide variety of space-based applications from earth observation to remote sensing to space-tug services and space debris management.

d. As of this writing, we have an order book of some US$3.0 million and a pipeline of sale leads with high confidence of a further US$5.0 million.

e. With further satellites equipped with IDRS being launched in FY2024, our recurring airtime revenue from the provisioning of IDRS data connection services grew by 12% to US$617K in FY2024 from US$550K in FY2023. Based on our current understanding of our respective customers’ launch programs and their launch service providers such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab and PSLV, we estimate at least 12 units of the IDRS flight terminals will be launched over the next 6 to 12 months. The new launches will add to the recurring airtime revenue from our provision of data connection services. Therefore, we expect an accelerated growth for both IDRS terminals and recurring IDRS airtime revenue over the next 12 months.

# CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

# 2. ADR-Related Business etc

(relating to the sales of our reconfigurable embedded hardware solutions developed for software defined applications which also includes Software Defined Radio (“SDR”))

# a.

Over the past years the development of several SDR modules under various contracts with our partners, including a large local technology company, has paved the way for our supply of such modules to generate this new stream of revenue. The contract of US$3.67 million with optional purchase was awarded in May 2024 (refer to our SGX Announcement dated 23 May 2024). We have also received new design contracts which shall be the enablers for subsequent supply revenue, with some of the developmental work likely to be completed within FY2025.

# b.

The ultra-high-quality standard demanded by our clients and the challenges in managing the supply chains and manufacturing processes have collectively elevated the overall capabilities of our company in managing the supply chain and in manufacturing such ultra-high-quality products. With the successful deliveries of the products, we are confident of receiving repeated purchase orders from the same client. With this strong credential, we are now attracting new customers with similar quality demands for our design and supply services.

# c.

Since the successful launch of the ADRS1000™ module, a state-of-the-art 16-channel Direct Sampling re-configurable wireless System-on-Module (SOM), we successfully shipped and fulfilled customers’ orders in anti-drone and smart RF sensing industries in FY2024. While we continue to receive orders from these industrial segments for delivery in FY2025, we are also ratcheting up our sales and marketing efforts to address new market opportunities from other industries, where highly complex software defined applications are now moving.

# d.

As of this writing, we have an order book from ADR-Related Business including new design and supply contracts of some US$6.4 million and a pipeline of sale leads with high confidence of some US$4.6 million.

# SUMMARY

We have seen a significant improvement this year in the business performance across all the business metrics and including a notable increase in revenue of 69% compared to FY2023. Most importantly, we have made great strides in turning around the financial losses incurred for the previous three consecutive years by realising a post-tax profit for FY2024 of US$278,000. This achievement bears true testament to the commitment and dedication by the management and staff in their ongoing and notable endeavours.

We enter this next financial year in a far healthier position than has been the case for some time. Our confirmed order book of some US$9 million across both the SPC and ADR business segments is most encouraging and we are as well broadening and strengthening our customer base. We anticipate this strong growth trend to continue as we move forward.

# A WORD OF THANKS

My sincere appreciation goes to the management and staff for their demonstrated and impressive levels of commitment to the business and for their significant contributions throughout the year. It is indeed pleasing to be able to reflect upon these results in the knowledge that it was a true team effort that enabled such an outcome.

It is important to recognise the support provided to the business by our supplier base, who have helped in addressing and resolving some of the ongoing supply-chain challenges which have still been evident during this past 12 months. My appreciation is also sincerely conveyed to our increasingly diverse customer base and key partners, who have continued to demonstrate high levels of support throughout the year. It is also with great appreciation that I extend my thanks to my fellow Directors of the Group. We operate with a relatively small Board, but one which is composed of experts in their respective fields and who provide a diverse spread of experience, expertise and strategic strengths. Their contributions have been invaluable.

As was the case last year, my final but sincere appreciation is expressed to you, our Shareholders. We continue to appreciate the strong support which has been evident over the years and throughout challenging times. We have made significant progress this year towards the realisation of those goals we pursued over these past several years and we very much look forward to working with you throughout this next period in the further realisation of ongoing business growth and success.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  07

# FINANCIAL REVIEW

# TURNOVER

The Group recorded 60.2% increase in turnover to US$8.2 million for 2H2024 from that of US$5.1 million in 2H2023. With the business momentum from our 2 main engines of growth, namely SPC-Related Business and ADR-Related Business continuing its growth momentum this year we achieved a 69.2% increase to US$12.8 million for FY2024 compared to the US$7.5 million for FY2023.

Almost 90% of the revenue in FY2024 was attributed to the SPC-Related Business and ADR-Related Business as both registered significant year-on-year growth of 50% and 99% respectively. The growth of the SPC-Related Business was driven by the continual orders for our IDRS terminals and the accompanying data connectivity services predominantly from US and Japan. The ADR-Related Business was largely driven by the supplies of certain reconfigurable embedded modules that the Company developed against contracts for a large local technology company. Added to this revenue is the improving sales of the ADRS1000, a highly compact state-of-the-art Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) module for advanced complex digital radio applications in the 5G era and beyond.

# PROFITABILITY

The Group recorded a gross profit of US$6.7 million against a gross profit margin of 52.5% for FY2024 compared to a gross profit of US$3.6 million against a gross profit margin of 47.6% for FY2023.

The higher gross profit and gross profit margin were attributed principally to the delivery of more high yielding products in FY2024 relative to FY2023.

The selling and distribution expenses of the Group increased by US$289,000 or 45.5% from US$636,000 in FY2023 to US$925,000 in FY2024 due mainly to new marketing initiatives, including additional marketing and expenses incurred for participation in overseas exhibitions.

The administrative expenses of the Group increased from US$2,950,000 in FY2023 to US$3,389,000 in FY2024 due primarily to increased expenses incurred on corporate activities as well as higher manpower costs and related expenses including increased headcount in the quality and operational area to augment the processes in the SPC-Related and ADR-Related Businesses of the Group.

The other operating expenses decreased by US$1,099,000 from US$2,861,000 to US$1,762,000 mainly attributed to the absence of US$600,000 impairment for Development Expenditure in FY2023 and decrease in inventory written-off in FY2024 as compared to FY2023.

The other operating income of the Group in FY2024 was mainly related to government grants received, fair value gain on financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and payables written off while FY2023 mainly consisted of government grants received.

The higher finance expenses incurred by the Group in FY2024 can be attributed mainly to the need to service the S$5.0 million RCB which was completed in November 2022 and more short-term borrowings for working capital to support the increased orders secured.

Consequence to the above, the Group has emerged from the net loss after tax of US$3.3 million in FY2023 to a net profit after tax of US$278,000 in FY2024.

# Review of financial position as at 31 March 2024 (relative to that as at 31 March 2023)

# LONG-TERM ASSETS

The increase in property, plant and equipment of the Group was attributed mainly to capitalisation of the right of use assets resulting from the extension of our office lease for another 3 years during the year.

The intangible assets relate mainly to the development expenses incurred (net of amortisation and impairment) as the Group continues to develop its proprietary technologies and products, including its space resilient technologies and new spin-off products and services. The slight increase of 2.2% was due mainly to development expenses incurred in FY2024 for certain projects offset by the commencement of amortisation of part of the completed space resilient projects without further impairment of existing development expenses.

There is no change in the Company’s subsidiaries as there was no issuance of new shares in a subsidiary via capitalisation of amount due from that subsidiary company.

# FINANCIAL REVIEW

# CURRENT ASSETS

Inventory increased by 48.5% due to US$2.7 million stocks purchased to satisfy customers’ orders.

The increase in trade receivables by 54.7% was due to sales towards the end of FY2024 while the increase in other receivables, deposits and prepayments by 201.0% due to more prepayments made to suppliers in line with the purchase orders placed by our customers for our IDRS Terminals (SPC-Related business) during FY2024 and GST paid on purchases made. As of 17 May 2024, 67.1% of total trade receivables had been collected from major customers and we are on course to collect most of the trade receivables outstanding as at 31 March 2024.

The decrease in other investment was due the recognition of the fair value loss arising from the Company’s other equity investment as at 31 March 2024.

The increase in contract liabilities relate mainly to US$930,000 advances and deposits from new and existing customers for new purchase orders received for our IDRS Terminals (SPC-Related Business) during FY2024.

The non-current borrowings consist of the Redeemable Convertible Bonds (“RCB”) issued in November 2022 which will mature in 5 years from issue date and the Convertible loan notes (“CLN”) issued during FY2024 which will mature in 2 years from issue date.

There is no change in Share Capital for FY2024 as compared to the allotment of 717,430,000 new ordinary shares pursuant to Placement, Warrants and Optional Subscriptions Rights exercised in 1H2023 and the allotment of 117 new shares pursuant to the conversion of RCB.

# Consequence to the above:

# CURRENT LIABILITIES

The increase in trade payables by 160.9% was attributed mainly to higher inventory carried to support the higher sales volume deliveries towards the year end with the W-I-P in hand which we produced in batches for efficiency and consistency explained above.

The increase in other payables and accruals by 16.4% was attributed mainly to more accruals for employee related expenses and benefits.

The increase in provisions was due mainly to the higher provision for Directors’ fees for FY2024 arising from the increase in the meetings frequency.

The increase in borrowings was attributed principally to convertible loan notes issued towards the end of FY2024.

The increase in lease liabilities both current and non-current, relate to the recognition of right of use of assets as lease liabilities resulting from our office lease extended for another 3 years during the year.

# 1.

The debt-to-equity of the Group (defined as the ratio of all interest-bearing loans of the Group to the shareholders’ fund of the Group) increased to 76.1% as at 31 March 2024 from 73.1% as at 31 March 2023 after the recent CLN issue;

# 2.

The working capital position of the Group improved from a working capital of US$2.2 million as at 31 March 2023 to a US$2.9 million as at 31 March 2024;

# 3.

The net cash flow of the Group recorded a net cash generated from operation of US$1.8 million in FY2024 compared to net cash used in operations of US$2.7 million in FY2023, of which was substantially covered by cash generated from financing activities in FY2023;

# 4.

The net asset value of the Group improved by US$302,000 to US$6.1 million as at 31 March 2024 while the net asset value per ordinary share increased to 0.19 US cent per Share as at 31 March 2024 from 0.18 US cent per Share as at 31 March 2023.

# IN CONCLUSION

We are encouraged by the revenue growth achieved in FY2024 as compared to FY2023 as well as achieving a positive EBIDTA and a pre-tax profit of US$307,000. We expect the momentum to continue for the next 12 months.

# THE GROUP’S SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH AND STRATEGY

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT APPROACH

The Group’s materiality assessment involves employees engaging with relevant stakeholders during their routine business activities. This process identifies sustainability factors that are essential to both the Group's operations and its stakeholders, allowing the Group to allocate resources effectively to create sustainable value. The assessment is reviewed annually to incorporate changes in business operations, environmental conditions, stakeholder feedback, and sustainability trends.

GRI 3-1

The Group's materiality assessment complies with the SGX guidelines on Sustainability Reporting and the GRI guidance for determining material topics. According to GRI standards, materiality in sustainability reporting includes topics and indicators that reflect the Group’s significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, as well as those that would substantially influence stakeholders' evaluations and decisions.

In assessing Addvalue's activities, impacts, and the significant expectations and interests of its stakeholders, the Group has applied the GRI reporting principles through a four-step approach to derive its material sustainability factors.

|1. Identification|2. Prioritisation|3. Validation|4. Review|
|---|---|---|---|
|The identification of material factors involves an assessment of the risks and opportunities, actual and potential impacts related to the Group's activities and boundaries.|The factors will be prioritised based on their materiality levels, their significance to stakeholders, and their importance to the Group.|The shortlisted material ESG factors will then be internally validated by the Group’s Sustainability Committee (“SC”), which consists of senior management, and submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee (the “ARC”) of the Board for approval.|These material ESG factors will be reviewed and reassessed for their relevance to the Group’s sustainability goals, and may be amended in response to changes in business operations.|

# GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS FACTORS

# GRI 2-9, 2-16, 2-23, 2-24

Acting responsibly and ethically is essential for maintaining the trust and confidence of the Group's stakeholders. To consistently uphold high ethical standards and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, the Group fosters an ethical working environment by requiring adherence to the Addvalue Corporate Policies and Business Conduct Guidelines, which are regularly reviewed and updated. Additionally, the Group cultivates a culture of risk awareness to promote good corporate governance and maintain a robust system of internal controls.

To safeguard against cybersecurity risks and protect confidential information for stakeholders, proactive measures are implemented. Regular seminars on the importance of compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) are also conducted to ensure that all employees understand their responsibilities.

Furthermore, the Group has established an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework to manage inherent risks across the Group’s business. An annual ERM exercise is conducted to identify and assess key risks. This framework provides a structured and disciplined approach to identifying and assessing key risks and their potential impact on the achievement of the Group’s key objectives. Control measures are put in place to align these risks with Addvalue’s risk appetite, ensuring a holistic approach rather than isolated efforts within specific areas or functions. This enhances the Group’s agility in responding to risk events.

The Board and Management are dedicated to enhancing stakeholder value through a robust corporate governance framework, exemplified by the adoption of a Sustainability Reporting Policy (“SR Policy”) since FY2023. This policy outlines the reporting structure, materiality assessment, and processes for identifying and monitoring key sustainability factors. Acting as a cornerstone for sustainability reporting, the SR Policy has significantly facilitated the management of ESG-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, the Board supervises the identification and assessment of ESG issues that hold significance for both operations and stakeholders.

Currently, any emerging concerns can be communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee (“ARC”). Notably, no concerns were identified or reported in FY2024, indicating a stable and well-managed risk environment.

# ESG

In FY2024, executive remuneration was not linked to sustainability performance. However, as the Group evolves, there will be consideration of integrating sustainability performance into the criteria for executive remuneration, aligning leadership incentives with the Group’s sustainability goals and long-term vision.

For a comprehensive understanding of the Group’s corporate governance practices and risk management framework, please refer to the Statement of Corporate Governance section in the Group’s Annual Report 2024. This section provides detailed insights into the Group's governance strategies, policies, and mechanisms for effectively managing and mitigating risks.

The Group has established a SC to oversee Addvalue's sustainability targets. Operating under the Board’s ARC, the SC is led by Addvalue's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and supported by management executives. The SC includes the Sustainability Task Force (the "Task Force"), which is divided into three sub-committees focusing on environment, social, and governance. These sub-committees comprise members from various departments, including finance, human resources, operations, and public relations, hosting a diversity of experiences and backgrounds.

The Task Force's core focus is to develop a comprehensive sustainability framework, fostering a culture of sustainable business practices, and monitoring sustainability performance. Their responsibilities include creating and refining this framework, ensuring business objectives align with ESG targets, and communicating progress to the Board. They oversee dedicated teams implementing sustainability measures, tracking data accurately, and monitoring real-time progress. The Task Force also evaluates objectives, addresses challenges, sets targets, and ensures alignment with the Group’s strategic direction.

Moreover, the Board integrates sustainability considerations into the Group's strategy formulation. Annually, the Board reviews and approves key environmental, social, and economic topics, reinforcing the Group’s commitment to sustainable practices at all levels. This top-down integration underscores the Group's dedication to embedding sustainability deeply into its operations, making it a fundamental aspect of the Group’s identity.

# ANTI-CORRUPTION

GRI 2-15, 2-23, 2-24, 3-3, 205-1, 205-2, 205-3

Addvalue maintains a stringent zero-tolerance policy against bribery and corruption. To reinforce this commitment, the Group has established a comprehensive whistle-blowing policy, empowering employees to confidentially report any potential misconduct or improprieties within the Group. This year, Addvalue has diligently reviewed and enhanced its whistle-blowing policy to ensure its effectiveness.

Employees are encouraged to utilise the “Whistle-blower Reporting Form” readily accessible on Addvalue’s Intranet, to raise concerns or disclose any irregularities without fear of retaliation. This platform serves as a crucial mechanism for promoting transparency and accountability throughout the Group.

The Group is proud to announce the successful maintenance of its zero-corruption record (FY2023: Nil). This achievement is the result of its diligent efforts, including an annual review conducted under Enterprise Risk Management to assess operational risks related to corruption. During the risk assessment, no significant risks related to corruption were identified, affirming the Group’s commitment to upholding the highest ethical standards.

Moving forward, Addvalue remains steadfast in its commitment to sustaining its zero-corruption record. This will be achieved through continued vigilance and by ensuring that employees, governance body members, and business partners are fully aware of its anti-corruption and whistle-blowing policies, and are compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. These efforts are further elaborated below.

# Communication to Employees

Addvalue maintains a stringent stance against corruption by delivering comprehensive briefings on corporate policies and the repercussions of policy violations, including severe penalties, disciplinary actions, or dismissal, to all newly hired staff, both local and overseas. This initiative has successfully ensured 100% communication of anti-corruption policies to all employees, in alignment with Management’s key performance indicators (“KPIs”) (FY2023: 100%). This commitment will continue, with ongoing efforts to periodically reinforce these policies among all employees, thereby fostering the highest standards of trust in all operations.

All employees are also required to complete a Conflict of Interest Declaration Form upon joining and must update Human Resources as circumstances change. Since FY2021, employees have been mandated to declare their conflicts of interest annually. This practice ensures that personal interests do not unduly influence decision-making or professional judgment, thus preventing conflicts that could compromise the Group’s interests.

# GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS FACTORS

# Communication to Governance Body Members

All newly appointed Directors will receive comprehensive information regarding Addvalue’s anti-corruption policies. They are required to thoroughly review these policies to familiarise themselves with the core principles of fairness, honesty, openness, decency, integrity, and respect. Addvalue expects governance body members to uphold their integrity and act in the best interest of Addvalue on behalf of their stakeholders.

Whistle-blowing reports will also be communicated during regular quarterly audit committee meetings and to the Board. The Group noted that no complaints were received in FY2024 (FY2023: Nil). Additionally, the Board is mandated to strictly adhere to the Group’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is readily accessible on Addvalue’s website:

The Group firmly believes that sustainable environmental practices can coexist with corporate growth. Addvalue is committed to aligning its operational practices with international standards and industry best practices for environmental management system. The Group's objective is to minimise the adverse environmental impact of its business activities by enhancing resource efficiency in daily operations and developing a sustainable supply chain.

As environmental challenges increasingly threaten future sustainability, the imperative for environmental preservation becomes ever more critical for businesses and communities. In its commitment to the environment, Addvalue recognises its responsibility to mitigate climate change and reduce its negative impact through dedicated conservation efforts.

By integrating robust environmental practices into its operations, the Group demonstrates its commitment to both corporate growth and environmental stewardship, ensuring that sustainability remains a core component of its corporate identity.

# SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Addvalue believes the sustainability of its supply chain is an integral part to the sustainability performance. As part of its supply chain operations, Addvalue recognises the critical role of materials sourcing and is committed to continuously improving and maintaining the quality of materials used for production. The Group took a holistic approach to product development sustainability by ensuring every opportunity is provided to review the types and quantities of materials used and processes applied to the production of its products for commercial purposes.

The Group’s existing vendors and contract manufacturers are evaluated on their environmental impact through an annual Vendor Evaluation and Qualification procedure to determine whether they meet the minimum requirements. This process aims to ensure that quality is upheld and that suppliers adhere to Addvalue’s environmental standards for the products and services they provide. Additionally, as part of the Group’s stringent supplier selection process, all new key suppliers undergo screening for significant negative environmental and social impacts resulting from their business operations.

The supplier environmental screening criteria that were used to screen both new and existing suppliers consider factors such as their efforts towards recycling, incorporation of environmentally friendly materials, energy conservation, environmental certifications, and their use of toxic or hazardous substance materials. In FY2024, 100% of new suppliers were screened using environmental criteria (FY2023: 100%).

Based on the assessment feedback, 17 out of 18 suppliers (representing 94% of its suppliers) have successfully passed the supplier environmental assessment, demonstrating their commitment to sustainable practices, a slight improvement from 93% in FY2023. These suppliers have implemented internal protocols to encourage the use of recycled paper, enforce waste management procedures to ensure proper disposal of paper waste for recycling, and have strategies in place to incorporate environmentally friendly materials into their operations. Furthermore, they are actively working to minimise emissions of controlled chemical substances by abstaining from the use of toxic or hazardous materials. The Group remains committed to evaluating its suppliers' environmental practices to mitigate adverse environmental impacts in FY2024.

# SUPPLIER ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT

Moreover, 11 suppliers (representing 61% of its suppliers) are compliant with industry standards such as ISO14001, further affirming their commitment to environmental responsibility. However, the Group has identified one supplier (representing 6% of its suppliers) whose manufacturing process is likely to pose significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts. In addition, this supplier complied with only 20% of the social criteria. In response, the Group is committed to engaging continuously with the supplier to address identified gaps and collaboratively work towards aligning with its environmental standards. This process will involve providing support and guidance, as well as regular monitoring and evaluation of progress. Additionally, the Group will explore alternative sourcing options and diversify its supplier base to mitigate potential risks associated with non-compliance.

Despite these challenges, no relationships were terminated as a result of environmental impacts identified through assessment. Addvalue believes in the power of collaboration and continuous improvement. Instead of severing ties, the Group views such instances as opportunities for constructive dialogue and partnership enhancement. Through open communication and mutual understanding, the Group aims to facilitate positive change and promote responsible business practices within its supply chain ecosystem.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE

# Principle 2:

The board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.

# PROVISION 2.1

# INDEPENDENT ELEMENT ON THE BOARD

The Board comprises five members, two of whom, namely Mr Richard J Denny and Ms Goh Liang Choo are Independent Directors. The remaining three comprise two Non-Executive directors coupled with one executive director who holds the appointment of CEO.

The criterion for independence is based on the definition given in the Code and in the Listing Rules. The Code has defined an “independent” director as one who is independent in conduct, character and judgement and has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgement with a view to the best interests of the company. Under the Listing Rules, an independent director is not one who is or has been employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three financial years; or not one who has an immediate family member who is, or has been in any of the past three financial years, employed by the company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee.

All the Independent Directors of the Company have confirmed their independence and that they do not have any relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of their independent judgement pursuant to the Listing Rules. None of the independent Directors have served on Board for more than nine years from the date of their respective appointments.

# PROVISIONS 2.2 AND 2.3

# COMPOSITION OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE BOARD

Under Rule 210(5)(c) of the Listing Rules which come into effect on 1 January 2022, the Board must have at least two Non-executive Directors who are independent that should make up at least one-third of the board. In the event of any retirement or resignation which renders the issuer unable to meet any of the foregoing requirements, the Company should endeavour to fill the vacancy within two months, but in any case, not later than three months. The current composition of our Board complies with the Listing Rules.

The Chairman is an Independent Director and the requirement under Provision 2.2 of the Code, for the independent directors to make up a majority of the board where the chairman is not an independent director does not apply Under Provision 2.3 of the Code, the non-executive directors should make up a majority of the board.

The Board comprises four Non-Executive Directors (two of whom are Independent Directors) which complies with Provision 2.3 of the Code.

Consequently, the composition of the Board comprises five directors, namely two Independent Directors, two Non-Executive Directors and one Executive Director. The reconstitution provides a good balance of authority and power within the Board. In addition, each of the NRC, and ARC, which assists the Board in its functions, is chaired by an Independent Director and with a majority being Independent Directors. For the Board Exco which is chaired by a Non-Executive Director with the Executive Director as member, all decisions have to be unanimous, otherwise, the matter will be referred to the Board for approval. Hence, the Board is of the view that there is a strong independence element within the Board which is consistent with Principle 2 of the Code.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  55

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# PROVISION 2.4 BOARD SIZE AND DIVERSITY

The composition of the Board is reviewed on an annual basis by the NRC. The NRC is of the opinion that the current size of the Board is adequate, taking into account the nature and scope of the Group’s operations.

The Board has in place a Board Diversity Policy to ensure that the Board has an appropriate level of diversity of thoughts and backgrounds to enable wider perspectives which encourage more effective discussions, better decision-making and governance of the Company and its businesses. The Board members collectively have the necessary skills and competencies, covering business and management experience, industry knowledge and strategic planning skills, for the effective functioning of the Board and informed decision-making.

Annually the NRC reviews and assesses the Board composition, and recommends the appointment of new directors, where applicable. For new and continuing appointments, the NRC will consider factors such as skills, experience, age, gender, educational and professional background, tenure of service and other relevant personal attributes that are important and needed to support good decision making at the Board level. As gender is an important aspect of diversity, the NRC will strive to ensure that the search for candidates for Board appointments will include female candidates that meet the set requirements for a new candidate, if the opportunity arises.

The NRC with the Board’s concurrence has set the following targets to enhance Board diversity:

# Skills and experience diversity

For skill, experience and industry expertise diversity, the Board’s target to have a mix of core competencies as set out above with a minimum of one (1) Director with the necessary skill, experience and industry expertise knowledge and one (1) Director with accounting and finance related knowledge. Currently it has met its skill diversity target with the current Directors.

Mr Tan Khai Pang, one of the co-founders of the Company, has more than 30 years of experience in the business. Mr Richard J Denny, with over 40 years of experience in the space and satellite sector, held a range of positions spanning across the technical and operational functions of Inmarsat plc (“Inmarsat”) and was responsible for Inmarsat’s fleet of satellites, network operations activities, satellite gateways, spectrum regulatory and spectrum management activities as well as satellite navigation services. Mr Paul C Burke is an entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience in the aviation industry and product design and manufacturing for the e-mobility market. Mr Chua Chwee Koh has 22 years of experience in Singapore Armed Forces and subsequently spent another 17 years with Certis CISCO in leading and transforming its business operations. Hence, he has exposure and experience, in board matters including business transformation, financial management and risk management. Ms Goh Liang Choo brings with her more than 30 years of management and international experience with her career in Shell, UBS Warburg (London), General Electric Company (USA) and Ernst and Young Singapore on roles encompassing financial management, board governance, acquisitions and business integrations, external audit, process and business transformation. In addition, Ms Goh being a CPA will not only strengthen the Board but also improve the Board’s independence and add gender diversity to enhance corporate governance.

The Company is of the view that the Board, as a whole, provides core competencies necessary to meet the Group’s requirements, taking into account the nature and scope of the Group’s operations; in particular Mr Denny and Mr Burke, with their backgrounds and experience, bring with them wide perspectives which encourage more effective discussions and better decision-making, and Ms Goh and Mr Chua bring with them their financial management experience.

# PROVISION 2.5

# ROLE OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

During the financial year reported on, the Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop both the Group’s short-term and long-term business strategies. Management’s progress and performance in implementing such agreed business strategies are monitored by the Non-Executive Directors.

# PROVISIONS 3.1 AND 3.2

# SEPARATE ROLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CEO

The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company are separate persons. Mr. Richard J Denny is the Independent Director and Chairman while Mr. Tan Khai Pang is the CEO. This ensures that there is an appropriate balance of power between the Chairman of the Board and the CEO, thereby allowing increased accountability and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.

As Chairman, Mr Richard J Denny’s responsibilities include:

- leading the Board in its role;
- scheduling meetings (with assistance from the Company Secretary) to enable the Board to perform its duties responsibly while not interfering with the flow of the Group’s operations;
- preparing meeting agenda;

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  57

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The CEO consults with the Board and Board Committees on major issues. There are constant communications among Board members, and no Director represents a considerable concentration of power as any key decision will require the approval from all Directors prior to implementation.

With the positions of Chairman and the CEO filled by different persons, there is a clear separation of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO. The Chairman and the CEO are not related.

# PROVISION 3.3

# LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

The Company does not have a lead Independent Director as (i) the Chairman is independent and (ii) the Chairman and the CEO of the Company are separate persons. The Chairman is available to Shareholders where they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of communication with the Chairman or Management are inappropriate or inadequate.

# BOARD MEMBERSHIP

# Principle 4:

The Board had merged the Nominating Committee and Remuneration Committee into a new Committee, known as Nominating and Remuneration Committee (“NRC”) in November 2023, which aimed to improve its efficiency and effectiveness in discharging its duties. The scope and responsibilities of NRC are set out in the Term of Reference approved by the Board.

# PROVISIONS 4.1 AND 4.2

# NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The NRC comprises two (2) Independent Directors and a Non-Executive Director, namely:

|Mr Richard J Denny|(Chairman/Independent Director)|
|---|---|
|Ms Goh Liang Choo|(Member/Independent Director)|
|Mr Paul C Burke|(Member/Non-Executive Director)|

The role of the NRC as a nominating committee is to make recommendations to the Board on relevant matters relating to:

1. The review of the succession plans for Directors, in particular the appointment and/or replacement of the Chairman, the CEO and key management personnel;
2. The process and criteria for evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Board Committees and Directors, including the review of the independence of the Independent Directors;
3. The review of training and professional development programmes for the Board and its Directors; and
4. The appointment and re-appointment of Directors (including alternate Directors, if any).

The NRC will review Board succession plans for Directors and will seek to refresh the Board membership in an orderly manner where it deems applicable. The NRC will also ensure that the Company has succession planning for its Executive Directors and key management personnel, including the appointment, training and mentoring of successors. The NRC has reviewed contingency arrangements for any unexpected incapacity of the Executive Director or any of key management personnel and is satisfied with the procedures in place in ensuring the transition to a full operational management team.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# PROVISION 4.3

# PROCESS FOR THE SELECTION, APPOINTMENT AND RE-APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS

The Company has in place policies and procedures for the appointment of new Directors, including the description on the search and nomination process.

The composition of the Board is reviewed on an annual basis by the NRC to ensure that the Board is of the appropriate size and has the mix of expertise and experience, and collectively possess the necessary core competencies for effective functioning and informed decision-making.

Where there is a resignation or retirement of an existing Director, the NRC will re-evaluate the Board composition to assess the competencies for the replacement. The NRC will deliberate and propose to the Board the background, skills, qualification and experience of the candidate it deems appropriate. The factors taken into consideration by the NRC could include among other things, whether the new Director can add to or complement the mix of skills and qualifications in the existing Board; relevance of his or her experience and contributions to the business of the Group; and the depth and breadth he or she could bring to Board discussions. Candidates are sourced through a network of contacts and identified based on the established criteria. Search can be made through relevant institutions such as the Singapore Institute of Directors, professional organisations, business federations or external search consultants. New Directors will be appointed by way of a resolution by the Board or the Shareholders, after the NRC makes the necessary recommendation to the Board.

Regulation 104 of the Company’s Constitution requires one-third of the Directors to retire at each AGM.

Mr Tan Khai Pang is due to retire at the forthcoming AGM pursuant to Regulation 104 of the Company’s Constitution and Rule 720(5) of the Listing Rules. The NRC has recommended to the Board the re-election of Mr Tan Khai Pang at the forthcoming AGM. The Board has accepted the NRC’s recommendation.

The information on Mr Tan Khai Pang as required in Appendix 7.4.1 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST is contained in the Notice of the AGM.

# PROVISION 4.4

# DETERMINING DIRECTORS’ INDEPENDENCE

Each Independent Director completes a checklist to confirm his independence on an annual basis. The NRC has reviewed the independence of the Directors as mentioned under Provision 2.1.

# PROVISION 4.5

# DIRECTORS’ MULTIPLE BOARD REPRESENTATIONS

The NRC ensures that new Directors are aware of their duties and obligations. Each Director signs the undertaking in the form set out in Appendix 7.7 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST to undertake to use their best endeavours to comply with the Listing Rules and to procure that the Company too shall so comply.

The NRC considers and it is of the view that it would not be appropriate to set a limit on the number of directorships that a Director may hold because directors have different capabilities, and the nature of the organisations in which they hold appointments and the kind of Committees on which they serve are of different complexities. Accordingly, the NRC leaves it to each Director to personally determine the demands of his or her competing directorships and obligations and assess the number of directorships they could hold and serve effectively. The Board concurs with the NRC.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  59

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Mr Richard J Denny and Mr Paul C Burke have confirmed that they are able to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group. They do not have any full-time executive commitments in any companies and their experiences are valuable to the Board and the Board Committees. Mr Chua Chwee Kok only sits on the board of one other listed company, whereas Ms Goh Liang Choo does not sit on the board of any other companies and has confirmed that they would be able to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group.

After making all reasonable enquiries and having considered the aforementioned, nothing has come to the attention of the NRC to cause them to doubt that Mr Richard J Denny and Mr Paul C Burke would not have the ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group.

Details of the Directors’ principal commitments and outside directorships are set out in the “Board of Directors” section of this Annual Report.

# BOARD PERFORMANCE

# Principle 5:

The board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

# PROVISIONS 5.1 AND 5.2

# CONDUCT OF BOARD PERFORMANCE

The NRC has established a formal evaluation process to assess the effectiveness of individual Directors and of the Board as a whole.

Each year, the Directors are requested to complete appraisal forms to assess the overall effectiveness of the Board and the Board Committees, as well as each individual Director’s contributions to the Board and the Board Committees.

The appraisal of the Board considers the Board composition, maintenance of independence, timeliness and completeness of information provided to the Board, Board process, Board accountability, communication with the Management and standard of conduct. The results of the appraisal exercise are considered by the NRC, which then makes recommendations to the Board with the aim of helping the Board to discharge its duties more effectively. The Directors are assessed on their experience in being a company director, competence and knowledge, the level and quality of involvement during the course of the year, attendance record at meetings of the Board and the Board Committees, intensity of participation at meetings, the quality of interventions and special contributions.

The Board Committees are assessed on the work they perform in accordance with their terms of reference and the objectivity and independence in their deliberations and recommendations they presented to the Board.

For FY2024, the NRC has reviewed each individual Director’s performance during the appraisal exercise and the overall assessment of individual Directors and of the Board and Board Committees as a whole were good, effective and have acted independently in the interest of all shareholders. The NRC has discussed the results with the Board and it is the Board’s endeavour to, where appropriate, further improve and enhance its effectiveness regarding the Group’s performance, financially or otherwise. The Board is also satisfied that each Director has allocated sufficient time and resources to the affairs of the Group. All NRC members have abstained from the review process in connection with the assessment of his own performance.

The Company does not use any external professional facilitator for the assessments of the Board, Board Committees and individual Directors, and will consider the use of such facilitator as and when appropriate.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# LEVEL AND STRUCTURE OF REMUNERATION

# Principle 7:

The level and structure of remuneration of the board and key management personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the company.

# PROVISION 7.1

# REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL

The Company’s remuneration policy is to provide compensation packages at market rates which reward good performance and attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and employees.

The NRC will take into account the industry norms, the Group’s performance as well as the contribution and performance of each Director and key management personnel when determining their respective remuneration packages.

Executive Directors and key management personnel of the Group are paid a fixed monthly salary and variable bonus based on a combination of the Group’s performance, their operating unit performance and individual performance. The NRC members recommend the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and key management personnel of the Group for the approval by the Board.

# PROVISION 7.2

# REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The Board has also recommended that a fixed fee be paid to each of the Non-Executive Directors, taking into account the effort, time spent and responsibilities of each Non-Executive Director. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors will be subject to Shareholders’ approval at the AGM.

# PROVISION 7.3

# APPROPRIATE REMUNERATION TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND DIRECTORS

The Company has a share incentive scheme, namely, the Addvalue Technologies Performance Share Plan.

# Principle 8:

The company is transparent on its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation.

# PROVISION 8.1

# REMUNERATION REPORT

Details of the remuneration paid or proposed to be paid to the Directors of the Company for the FY2024 are set out below:

|Remuneration Bands|Director|Fixed Fees (%)|Salary1 (%)|Benefits1 (%)|Gratuity2 (%)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Above S$500,000|Nil|–|–|–|–|
|S$250,000 to S$499,999|Dr Chan Kum Lok, Colin2|–|46|15|39|

| |Mr Paul C Burke|100|–|–|–|
| |Mr Chua Chwee Koh|100|–|–|–|
| |Ms Goh Liang Choo|100|–|–|–|

1. The fixed salary amounts include salary, annual wage supplements and Central Provident Fund contribution while the benefits include variable bonuses linked to individual performances and other allowances.

2. Dr Chan Kum Lok, Colin relinquished his appointment as Executive Chairman and Director on 31 March 2023 and granted gratuity upon his relinquishment as per service agreement for the Dr Chan as disclosed during IPO in 2000.

3. Mr Wong resigned as Independent Director on 31 March 2024.

For FY2024 Annual Report, the Board considered the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration in bands of S$250,000 as adequate due to reasons of industry competitiveness, confidentiality and sensitivity of remuneration matters. The Board is of the view that it would be disadvantaged to the Group to detail the remuneration of the Executive Director. The Executive Director, who is non-substantial Shareholders of the Company, is employee of the Group like any of the other key management personnel who are not Directors and whose remuneration are disclosed in bands of S$250,000. The Board is of the view that he should not be disadvantaged relative to the other key management personnel of the Group just merely because he is a Director.

While the exact remuneration of the Directors was not given, the level and mix of remuneration of the Directors in percentage terms within remuneration bands of S$250,000 were provided.

# RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

# Principle 9:

The board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

# PROVISION 9.1

# RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS

The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard Shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets. The responsibility of overseeing the Company’s risk management framework and policies is undertaken by the ARC with the assistance of In.Corp Business Advisory Pte Ltd (“In.Corp”), a third party which the Company has appointed as its internal auditors since November 2019.

The main risks arising from the Group’s business and financial instruments are operational and financial risks. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities. To minimize such risk, the Group has put in place an Enterprise Risk Management Programme (“ERM”). The purpose of this programme was to actively engage senior management on a “hands-on” and proactive approach in managing and supervising the Group’s business, with focus on operational and compliance risks. The Group has also engaged In.Corp since November 2019 as its consultant to assist in this area.

Having considered the Group’s business operations, the existing internal control and risk management systems of the Group and the appointment of In.Corp as its internal auditors, the Board is of the view that a separate risk committee shall be established 2023. The Risk Committee (“RC”) convened its inaugural meeting on 9 May 2023 and was later amalgamated into the Audit Committee to form the Audit and Risk Committee on 31 March 2024.

# Composition of the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC)

|Ms Goh Liang Choo (Chairman)|Independent Non-executive Director|
|---|---|
|Mr Richard J Denny (Member)|Independent Non-executive Director|
|Mr Chua Chwee Koh (Member)1|Non-Independent Non-executive Director|
|Mr Wong Ming Ghee, Bernard (Member)1|Independent Non-executive Director|

1 Mr Wong resigned as Independent Director on 31 March 2024 and Mr Chua Chwee Koh appointed in his place.

The quorum necessary for the Committee shall be two members. A duly convened meeting of the Committee at which a quorum is present shall be competent to exercise all or any of the authorities, powers and discretions vested in or exercisable by the Committee.

The ARC carried out its duties in accordance with the terms of reference. The Committee shall review the Group’s strategy, policies, framework, processes and procedures for the identification, measurement, reporting and mitigation of material risks in the Group’s business, with due consideration to applicable laws and regulations, as appropriate, and report any significant matters, findings and recommendations in this regard to the Board.

The Independent Directors and Non-Executive Directors believe that the ARC benefits and will continue to benefit from the inputs of Mr Tan Khai Pang who is the CEO, in carrying out its functions effectively.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  65

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The ARC meets with the external and internal auditors without the presence of Management at least once a year to, amongst others, ascertain if there are any material weaknesses or control deficiencies in the Group’s financial reporting and operational systems. Mr Tan has been excluded from the aforesaid meeting(s) to ensure that the ARC remains a platform for external and internal auditors to provide their independent opinions without the influence of Management. This arrangement ensures that the presence of an executive director on the ARC will not lead to any conflict of interest or impede the independence of the ARC.

The ARC reviewed the internal audit reports provided by In.Corp and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system in the light of key business and financial risks affecting its business.

# PROVISION 9.2

# ASSURANCES FROM THE CEO AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

For FY2024, the Board has received assurance from the CEO and Chief Financial officer of the Company in the execution of their respective duties as CEO and Chief Financial Officer and to the best of their knowledge and belief that the financial records of the Group have been properly maintained; the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s operations and finances; and the Group’s risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective.

# BOARD’S COMMENT ON ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS

Based on the work performed by the external and internal auditors, the system of risk management and internal controls established and maintained by the Group, the assurances from the CEO and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, the reviews performed by the Management, the various Board Committees and the Board, pursuant to Rule 1207 (10) of the Listing Rules, the Board is of the opinion that the Group’s internal controls, including operation, financial, compliance, information technology controls and risk management system, are adequate and effective as at the date of this Annual Report. The ARC concurs with the Board’s opinion based on their reviews of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems.

The Board recognises that the system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and that no systems of internal controls or risk management can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of errors, poor judgement in decision making, losses, frauds or other irregularities. It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss or that the Group will not be adversely affected by any event that can be reasonably foreseen.

|Ms Goh Liang Choo (Chairman)|Independent Non-executive Director|
|---|---|
|Mr Richard J Denny (Member)|Independent Non-executive Director|
|Mr Chua Chwee Koh (Member)1|Non-Independent Non-executive Director|
|Mr Wong Ming Ghee, Bernard (Member)1|Independent Non-executive Director|

1 Mr Wong resigned as Independent Director on 31 March 2024 and Mr Chua Chwee Koh appointed in his place.

All the ARC members have had many years of senior management experience and were responsible and accountable for the financial performance of operations under their charge and had developed strong accounting or financial related management expertise. All the ARC members are kept up to date with changes in accounting standards and issues through updates from the external auditors. The Board is of the view that the ARC is able to discharge its functions effectively.

The ARC carries out its functions in accordance with Section 201B(5) of the Singapore Companies Act 1967, the Listing Rules, the Best Practices Guide issued by the SGX-ST and the provisions of the Code. In performing those functions, the ARC shall review, amongst others:

- the scope, adequacy, effectiveness, independence and the results of internal audit functions and audit procedures with the Company’s internal auditors;
- the adequacy, effectiveness, independence and scope of the audit plan of the Company’s external auditors and its report on the weaknesses of internal accounting controls arising from the statutory audit;
- the assistance given by the Management to the internal and external auditors;
- the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal control and risk management systems at least on an annual basis;
- the assurance from the CEO and the Financial Controller on the proper upkeep of financial records and financial statements;
- the significant financial reporting issues and judgements so as to ensure the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and the disclosures thereof in relation to the periodic results announcements of the Group prior to their submission to the Board for approval;
- the financial statements of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group as well as the external auditors’ report thereon for each financial year prior to their submission to the Board for approval;

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

- recommendations to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment or removal of the external auditors and the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;
- interested person transactions (as defined in Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST); and
- oversight over the administration of the framework for whistle-blowing.

The ARC has full access to the Management and is given the resources required for it to discharge its functions. The ARC has authority to investigate any matter within its terms of reference and discretion to invite any Director or executive officer of the Group (the “Executive Officer”) to attend its meetings.

The ARC also reviewed the key audit matters (“KAM”) set out in the auditor’s report for FY2024. The ARC had discussed and noted, together with the external auditors and the Management, on the approach and methodology applied by the external auditors in relation to the assessment of judgements and estimates on the significant matters reported in the KAM.

The Company confirms that it has complied with Rules 712 and 715 of the Listing Rules in engaging Forvis Mazars LLP (formerly known as Mazars LLP), an accounting firm registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore, as the external auditors of the Company and its Singapore subsidiaries. Forvis Mazars LLP (formerly known as Mazars LLP) have audited the Group’s significant foreign subsidiaries for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

With Amba Partners CPA Limited appointed as the external auditors of the Company’s subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong, and Beijing An Zheng CPA Co., Ltd as the external auditors of the Company’s subsidiary incorporated in the People’s Republic of China, the Board and the ARC are satisfied that the appointment of different auditors would not compromise the standard and the effectiveness of the audit of the Group and that Rule 716 of the Listing Rules has been complied with.

# Independence of external auditors

The ARC reviews the independence of the external auditors annually. It reviewed the amount of non-audit services rendered to the Group by the external auditors and was satisfied that the nature and extent of such services and objectivity of the external auditors. The aggregate fees paid to the Group’s external auditor Forvis Mazars LLP (formerly known as Mazars LLP), for FY2024 were $130,000 (FY2023: $120,000) and did not incur any non-audit services. Being satisfied that the nature and extent of such services will not prejudice the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the ARC recommended to the Board that Forvis Mazars LLP (formerly known as Mazars LLP) be nominated for re-appointment as the external auditors of the Group’s companies in Singapore at remuneration to be re-negotiated.

# Whistle-blowing policy

The Company has in place a whistle-blowing framework for staff to raise concerns about improprieties. The policy serves to encourage and provide a channel for employees to report in good faith and in confidence, without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. The objective of such an arrangement is to ensure independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action.

The ARC is responsible for oversight and monitoring of any whistle-blowing matters. All whistler-blower complaints will be investigated independently by the ARC and the findings will be reported to the Board.

68 ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

All whistle-blowing reports will be handled confidentially, except as necessary or appropriate to conduct investigation and to take remedial action, in accordance with the applicable law and regulations. In this regard, the identity of the whistle-blower making the allegation will be kept confidential and confined to disclosures on a need-to-know basis to the ARC, the investigating team, the Board of Directors of the Company; and any party to whom the identity of the whistle-blower is required to be disclosed by law.

The ARC members have the responsibility to conduct investigations. If a complaint falls within the scope of specific procedures of the Company, it will be referred for consideration under those procedures. The ARC will ensure that those procedures are conducted by persons who are independent of the complaint. The ARC may investigate the complaint and decide on the appropriate course of action. Where a complaint requires further investigations, the ARC shall nominate an independent investigation team to conduct the investigation. All members of the investigation team shall be independent and conduct the investigation impartially.

The Company will not tolerate the harassment or victimisation of anyone reporting a genuine concern. If the whistle-blower has suffered adverse treatment, harassment or victimisation as a result of his or her disclosure, he or she should submit a formal complaint to the Human Resources Department or higher authority as appropriate. An investigation may take place and disciplinary action may be taken against any person who harasses or victimises the whistle-blower or subject the whistle-blower to detrimental or unfair treatment.

There were no reports of whistle-blowing received in FY2024.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Addvalue Technologies Ltd (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 March 2024, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Group for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policy information from pages 86 to 169.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 March 2024 and of the financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Group for the financial year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (the “ACRA code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  79

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Overview

# Audit Approach

We designed a risk-based audit approach in identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement at both the financial statement and assertion levels.

# Materiality

As in all our audits, we exercised our professional judgement in determining our materiality, which was also affected by our perception of the financial information needs of the users of the financial statements, being the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable for a reasonably knowledgeable person to change or be influenced in his economic decision.

# Scope of audit

For the audit of the current financial year’s financial statements, we identified 4 significant components which required a full scope audit of their financial information, either because of their size or/and their risk characteristics.

All the significant components were audited by us.

# Area of focus

We focused our resources and effort on areas which were assessed to have higher risks of material misstatement, including areas which involve significant judgements and estimates to be made by directors.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Key Audit Matters (Continued)

|Key audit matters|Audit response|
|---|---|
|Impairment assessment of development expenditure|Refer to Note 3.2 for the relevant key sources of estimation uncertainty and Note 15 (Intangible Assets) for the disclosures relating to the impairment assessment.|

The Group develops and manufactures a range of terminals operating on major satellite networks for land, maritime, aeronautical applications and space resilient technologies. As at 31 March 2024, the carrying value of development expenditure amounted to US$8,101,041 (2023: US$7,926,397), which represented 43% (2023: 48%) of the Group’s total assets.

In accordance with SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets, an entity assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the development expenditure may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the management shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an entity shall also test the development expenditure not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount.

For the purpose of impairment assessment, development expenditure has been allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) as follows:

- Satellite communication (“Satcom”);
- Advance Digital Radio Solutions (“ADRS”); and
- Space Connectivity (“SPC”).

Management assessed discounted cash flow derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors and estimated the probable future economic benefits from the identified CGUs that are expected to be generated by the development expenditure developed by the Group.

Our audit procedures include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Assessed the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions used by management based on our knowledge of the business;
- Assessed independence and competence of management’s expert (external valuer) for the impairment assessment of the development expenditure;
- Involved both in-house and external valuation experts on the assessment of the value-in-use model;
- Performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions where we adjusted the discount rates, sales forecast, and revenue growth rates for those key assumptions that are most sensitive to the valuation model;
- Tested source data to supporting evidence on a sample basis, such as historical performance, management’s expectations of market developments, approved budgets and considered the reasonableness of these budgets.

We also considered the appropriateness of the disclosures in respect of value-in-use calculations presented in the financial statements.

The estimates of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs in which development expenditure attributable to, are determined based on value-in-use calculations. Discounted cash flow projections used in the calculation are based on the approved financial budgets, discount rate and growth rates in revenue and cost of sales, for which the estimates used are subjected to significant judgement applied by the management.

# TO THE MEMBERS OF ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Key Audit Matters (Continued)

|Key audit matters|Audit response|
|---|---|
|Provision for inventories obsolescence|Refer to Note 3.2 for the relevant key sources of estimation uncertainty relating to inventories valuation method.|

As at 31 March 2024, the Group’s inventories are US$7,276,516 (2023: US$4,898,776), representing 33% (2023: 30%) of the Group’s total assets.

With reference to SFRS(I) 2 Inventories, inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (“NRV”). Management reviews the Group’s inventories levels to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories. Our audit procedures included, and were not limited to, the following:

- Understood the inventory policy on making allowance of the Group;
- Reviewed the inventory aging and management’s assessment on potential stock obsolescence;
- Reviewed management’s assessment of the estimation of NRV of inventories as at 31 March 2024 to determine whether the inventories are measured at lower of cost and NRV.

The assessment of the provision for inventories obsolescence requires the use of significant judgement and estimates. Based on the Group’s policies, the inventories will be written off if they are aged more than 3 years.

Management’s allowance for inventories obsolescence is subjective and influenced by estimates concerning the level of sales activity. In consideration of the significance of the balance and significant estimates and judgement applied by management, we consider this as a key audit matter.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and the independent auditors’ report thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  83

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

These notes form an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.

# 1. GENERAL

Addvalue Technologies Ltd (the “Company”) (Registration Number 199603037H) is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Singapore and listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). The registered office and principal place of business of the Company is located at 202 Bedok South Avenue 1 #01-11 Singapore 469332.

The principal activity of the Company is that of investment holding.

The principal activities of its subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements.

The financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on the date of directors’ statement.

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 2.1 Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) including related Interpretations of SFRS(I) (“SFRS(I) INT”) and are prepared on the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.

The individual financial statements of each Group entity are measured and presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are presented in United States dollar (“US$”) which is also the functional currency of the Company.

In the current financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised SFRS(I)s and SFRS(I) INTs that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. The adoption of these new or revised SFRS(I)s and SFRS(I) INTs did not result in changes to the Group’s and Company’s accounting policies, and has no material effect on the current or prior year’s financial statement and is not expected to have a material effect on future periods.

The Group adopted the amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies in the current financial year. The amendments require the disclosure of “material” instead of “significant” accounting policy information and provides guidance to assist the entity in providing useful, entity-specific accounting policy information for the users’ understanding of the financial statements. Accordingly, management reviewed the accounting policies and updated the information disclosed in Note 2 Summary of material accounting policies in line with the amendments.

# 2.1 Basis of preparation (Continued)

SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT issued but not yet effective

At the date of authorisation of these statements, the following SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT that are relevant to the Group were issued but not yet effective:

|SFRS (I)|Title|Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|---|
|SFRS(I) 1-1|Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current|1 January 2024|
|SFRS(I) 10, SFRS(I) 1-28|Amendments to SFRS(I) 10 and SFRS(I) 1-28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture|To be determined|
|SFRS(I) 16|Amendments to SFRS(I) 16: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback|1 January 2024|

|SFRS(I) 1-21, SFRS(I) 1|Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-21: Lack of Exchangeability|1 January 2025|

Consequential amendments were also made to various standards as a result of these new/revised standards.

The Group does not intend to early adopt any of the above new/revised standards, interpretations and amendments to the existing standards. Management anticipates that the adoption of the aforementioned revised/new standards will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and Company in the period of their initial adoption.

# 2.2 Basis of consolidation

The financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) (i) over which the Group has power and the Group is (ii) able to use such power to (iii) affect its exposure, or rights, to variable returns from then through its involvement with them.

The Group reassesses whether it controls the subsidiaries if facts and circumstance indicate that there are changes to the one or more of the three elements of control.

When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it still has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances, to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group considers, among others, the extent of its voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders, currently exercisable substantive potential voting rights held by all parties, rights arising from contractual arrangements and voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.2 Basis of consolidation (Continued)

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group up to the effective date on which control ceases, as appropriate.

Intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cashflows relating to intragroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as that of the Company. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, non-controlling interests may be initially measured either at fair value or at their proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Losses in the subsidiary are attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any differences between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in the relative interests in the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to accumulated profits) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investments retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.

Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss that has been recognised in profit or loss in the Company’s separate financial statements.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  93

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.3 Business combinations

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and
assets constitute a business. When determining the acquired set of activities and assets constitute a business, the
Group assesses whether the acquired set of activities and assets includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive
process, which together contribute to the creation of outputs.

The Group has the option to apply a “concentration test” as a simplified assessment to determine whether an acquired
set of activities and assets is not a business. The Group makes the election separately for each transaction or other
event. The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in
a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.

The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given,
liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. For
each business combination, the Group determines whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree
at fair value or at proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-
related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under
SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations (“SFRS(I) 3”) are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-
current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with SFRS(I) 5 Non-Current Assets
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (“SFRS(I) 5”), which are recognised and measured at the lower of cost and fair
value less costs to sell.

The Group recognises any contingent consideration to be transferred for the acquiree at the fair value on the
acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement shall
be accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument
and within the scope of SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments (“SFRS(I) 9”), is measured at fair value with the changes in fair
value recognised in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with SFRS(I) 9. Other contingent consideration that is
not within the scope of SFRS(I) 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised
in profit or loss.

Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or
loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date
that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such
treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.3 Business combinations (Continued)

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under SFRS(I) 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:

- deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes and SFRS(I) 1-19 Employee Benefits respectively;
- liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with SFRS(I) 2 Share-based Payment; and
- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with SFRS(I) 5 are measured in accordance with that Standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset at the acquisition date and is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over net acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit (including the goodwill), the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.3 Business combinations (Continued)

The attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of gain or loss on disposal of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity.

# 2.4 Revenue recognition

Revenue from contracts with its customers is recognised when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised goods or service generated in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities to its customer, at a transaction price that reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or service and that is allocated to that performance obligation. The goods or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of the goods or service.

# Sale of finished products and components

The Group sells a range of tele-communication and satellite communication equipment to its customers. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the end customers (i.e. when the goods are delivered in accordance with the applicable incoterms or/and terms and conditions and significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer). A corresponding receivable is recognised for the consideration that is unconditional when only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

# Design service income

Design service includes project management services and testing services on products sold. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the services are completed. A corresponding receivable is recognised for the consideration that is unconditional when only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract on the basis of service milestone achieved.

# Warranty obligations

The Group provides a two-year assurance-type warranty for the sale of goods. These warranties are accounted for under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (“SFRS(I) 1-37”) (see Note 24).

# Financing components

The Group does not extend credit terms beyond one year and does not expect, at contract inception, that the period between when the Group transfers a promised goods or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that goods or service to be beyond one year. Accordingly, the Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing components.

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.5 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

# 2.6 Retirement benefits costs

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes, such as the Singapore Central Provident Fund, are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.

The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are required to provide staff pension benefits to their employees under existing PRC legislation. These subsidiaries are required to contribute a certain percentage of their payroll costs to the pension scheme to fund the benefits. The pension funds are managed by government agencies, which are responsible for paying pensions to the retired employees. Contributions under the pension scheme are charged to the profit or loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the pension scheme.

# 2.7 Employee leave entitlement

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the financial year.

# 2.8 Income tax

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or tax deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end of the financial year.

Deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  97

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.8 Income tax (Continued)

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

A deferred income tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the financial year and based on the tax consequence that will follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the financial year, to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities except for the investment properties where investment properties measured at fair value are presented to be recovered entirely through sale.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill or determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost.

Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

- when the sales tax that is incurred on purchases is not recoverable from the tax authorities, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
- receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

The Group’s sales of goods in the PRC are subjected to Value-added Tax (“VAT”) at the applicable tax rate of 13% for PRC domestic sales. Input tax on purchases can be deducted from output VAT. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of “other receivables” or “other payables” in the statement of financial position. The Group’s export sales are not subject to VAT.

# 2.9 Foreign currency transactions and translation

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the individual entities’ respective functional currencies at the
exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each financial year, monetary items denominated
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing as of the end of the financial year. Non-monetary items
carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date
when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign
currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary items are
included in profit or loss for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items
carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of
non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary
items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity through other comprehensive
income.

Exchange differences relating to assets under construction for future productive use, are included in the cost of those
assets where they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign
operations (including comparatives) are expressed in United States dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the end
of the financial year. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates
for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at
the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to
the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the
foreign operation is disposed off.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities (including
monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities
of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

# 2.10 Property, plant and equipment

Buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are shown at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation, and where applicable, accumulated impairment losses.

Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The cost of plant and equipment includes its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Dismantlement, removal or restoration costs are included as part of the cost of plant and equipment if the obligation for dismantlement, removal or restoration is incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the plant and equipment.

Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment is added to the carrying amount of the asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

|Leasehold buildings (over the lease term)|3|
|---|---|
|Laboratory equipment|5|
|Furniture, fittings and office equipment|3 - 10|
|Computers and software|2 - 5|
|Toolings|3|
|Renovations|6|

For right-of-use assets for which ownership of the underlying asset is not transferred to the Group by the end of the lease term, depreciation is charged over the lease term, using the straight-line method. The lease periods are disclosed in Note 30.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at the end of each financial year.

The gain or loss, being the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss. Any amount in the revaluation reserve relating to that asset is transferred to accumulated profits directly.

Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use.

# 2.11 Intangible assets

# Acquired intangible assets

Acquired intangible assets are measured initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Acquired intangible assets have either finite or indefinite useful life.

Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortised over its useful life, using its straight-line method.

The amortisation charge is recognised in profit or loss and is assessed for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated amortisation period and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at the end of each financial year.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised, but tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The indefinite useful life of an intangible asset is reviewed at the end of each financial year and where events and circumstances do not continue to support the indefinite useful life assessment for that asset, a change from indefinite to finite useful life is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and adjusted prospectively.

The intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal, with any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset, being the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, recognised in profit or loss.

# Internally generated intangible assets

Expenditure from the research phase of an internal project to create an intangible asset is expensed in profit or loss when it is incurred. Where the research phase cannot be distinguished from the development phase of an internal project, the Group treats the expenditure on that project as if it were incurred in the research phase only.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised, if, and only if, all the following have been demonstrated:

- the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
- the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
- the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
- how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible assets; and
- the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

# 2.11 Intangible assets (Continued)

# Internally generated intangible assets (Continued)

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is charged to profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

The amortisation charge is recognised in profit or loss and is assessed for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated amortisation period and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at the end of each financial year.

# (i) Development expenditure

Internally generated development expenditure are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. Amortisation is charged to the profit or loss on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 10 years.

# (ii) Patents

Separately acquired patents are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. Amortisation is charged to the profit or loss on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 7 years.

# (iii) Computer software

Separately acquired computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. Amortisation is charged to the profit or loss on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 5 years.

# 2.12 Investments in associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, being the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not of control or of joint control of those policies, and generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% or more of the voting power.

On acquisition of the associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the Group’s share of the associate’s profit or loss in the reporting period in which the investment is acquired. Investments in associates are carried at cost less any impairment loss that has been recognised in profit or loss in the Company’s separate financial statements.

# 2.12 Investments in associates (Continued)

The results and assets and liabilities of an associate are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity
method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held-for-sale, in which case it is accounted for
under SFRS(I) 5 from the date on which the investee become held-for-sale. Under the equity method, investments in
associates are carried at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the
associate, less any impairment loss of individual investments. The Group’s share of losses in an associate in excess
of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the
Group’s net investment in the associate) are not recognised, unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Distributions received from the associate reduce the
carrying amount of the investment. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group’s interest in an associate is
accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for goodwill arising on such acquisitions (see above).

Unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses
are also eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no impairment.

The Company has accounted for its investments in associates at cost in its separate financial statements.

# 2.13 Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets as at each reporting date to assess for any
indication of impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount
of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset
belongs.

Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, the Group also tests its intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing their respective
carrying amounts with their corresponding recoverable amounts.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-
in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

An impairment loss for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is recognised
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment
loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a
revaluation increase.

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.14 Financial instruments

The Group recognises a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

# Financial assets

# Initial recognition and measurement

With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company applies a practical expedient, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. Such trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company applies a practical expedient are measured at transaction price as defined in SFRS(I) 15 in Note 2.4.

The classification of the financial assets at initial recognition as subsequently measured at amortised cost and fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) depends on the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

The Group’s business model refers to how the Group manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows which determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both.

The Group determines whether the asset’s contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”) on the principal amount outstanding to determine the classification of the financial assets.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the financial asset at amortised cost are measured using the effective interest method and is subject to impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.

# Effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument. Income and expense are recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at effective interest rate applicable.

# Financial assets at FVTPL

A financial asset is subsequently measured at FVTPL if the financial asset is a financial asset held for trading, is not measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”), or is irrevocably elected at initial recognition to be designated FVTPL if, by designating the financial asset as FVTPL, eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.

Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss.

# Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets measured at amortised cost. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition by assessing the change in the risk of a default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument. Where the financial asset is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

The Group uses reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort as well as past due information when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Where the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL. Where the credit risk on that financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.

The Group applies the simplified approach to recognise the ECL for trade receivables and contract assets, which is to measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. As a practical expedient, the Group uses an allowance matrix derived based on historical credit loss experience adjusted for current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions for measuring ECL.

While they are not financial assets, contract assets arising from the Group’s contracts with customers under SFRS(I) 15 are assessed for impairment in accordance with SFRS(I) 9, similar to that of trade receivables.

The amount of ECL or reversal thereof that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recognised is recognised in profit or loss.

The Group directly reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when the entity has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.

For details on the Group’s accounting policy for its impairment of financial assets, refer to Note 40.

# Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds receivables.

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments

# Classification as debt or equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

# Equity instruments

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

# Ordinary share capital

Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.

# Financial liabilities

# Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities are recognised on trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, minus transaction costs, except for those financial liabilities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.

Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities.

Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss if the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial liabilities classified as at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting.

# Financial liabilities (Continued)

# Redeemable convertible bonds and convertible loan notes

Redeemable convertible bonds and convertible loan notes are treated as hybrid instruments, consisting of a liability component and embedded derivative component(s). The redeemable convertible bonds and convertible loan notes are designated as financial instruments that are carried at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety and therefore the embedded derivative are not recognised separately.

The redeemable convertible bonds and convertible loan notes are recognised initially at the fair value which is based on the issuance proceeds. Subsequently, the redeemable convertible bonds and convertible loan notes are carried at fair value with fair value changes being recognised in profit or loss on each reporting date.

# Derivative financial instruments

# Warrant liabilities

Derivatives are initially recognised at their fair values at the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair values at the end of each financial year. Fair value changes on derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss when the changes arise.

# Other financial liabilities

# Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, where applicable, using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss when the liability is derecognised and through the amortisation process.

# Borrowings

Interest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for borrowing costs (see Note 2.5 above). A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss when the liability is derecognised and through the amortisation process.

# Other financial liabilities (Continued)

# Financial guarantee contracts

The Company has issued corporate guarantees to banks and other financial institutions for facilities granted by them to certain subsidiaries and these guarantees qualify as financial guarantees because the Company is required to reimburse the banks and other financial institutions if these subsidiaries breach any repayment terms.

Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values plus transaction costs and subsequently at the higher of the amount of the loss allowance and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation in accordance with SFRS(I) 15.

# Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

# 2.15 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials comprise purchase costs accounted for on a weighted average basis. Work-in-progress and finished goods comprise cost of direct materials, direct labour and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity. These costs are assigned on a first-in first-out basis.

Based on the Group’s policy, the inventories will be written off if they are aged more than 3 years. Where necessary, allowance is provided for damage, obsolete and slow-moving items to adjust the carrying value of inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

# 2.16 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.17 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Where a contract contains more than one lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component. Where the contract contains non-lease components, the Group applied the practical expedient to not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date for all lease arrangement for which the Group is the lessee, except for leases which have lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets for which the Group applied the recognition exemption allowed under SFRS(I) 16 Leases (“SFRS(I) 16”). For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payment as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located. For right-of-use assets relates to property, plant and equipment to which the Group applies the revaluation model, the Group elected not to apply the revaluation model to all of the right-of-use assets that relate to that class of property, plant and equipment.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. When the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. The right-of-use asset is also reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability, where applicable.

Right-of-use assets are presented within “property, plant and equipment”.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate.

The Group generally uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group obtains a reference rate and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and the asset leased.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  109

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 2. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.17 Leases (Continued)

The lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable,
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date,
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee,
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, and
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to terminate early and lease payments for an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group remeasures the lease liability when there is a change in the lease term due to a change in assessment of whether it will exercise a termination or extension or purchase option or due to a change in future lease payment resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payment.

Where there is a remeasurement of the lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset or in profit or loss where there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability and the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero.

# 2.18 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the financial year, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows, which is discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

Changes in the estimated timing or amount of the expenditure or discount rate are recognised in profit or loss as they arise.

A provision is recognised for onerous contracts when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it and is measured at the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any expected cost of terminating it. In determining the cost of fulfilling the contract, the Group includes both the incremental costs and an allocation of others costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. Before a separate provision for an onerous contract is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract.

# 2.18 Provisions (Continued)

Warranty provisions

Provisions for warranty related costs are recognised when the product is sold or services provided. Initial recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of warranty related costs is revised annually.

# 2.19 Government grants

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. Where the grant relates to an expense, the grant is recognised as income in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate, is expensed. Where the grant relates to an asset, the grant is recognised as deferred capital grant on the statement of financial position and is amortised to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalment.

# 2.20 Contingencies

A contingent liability is:

1. a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or
2. a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
1. it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or
2. the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingencies are not recognised on the statement of financial position of the Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair value can be reliably determined.

# 2.21 Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the group of executive directors and the chief executive officer who makes strategic decisions.

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

The Group made judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that
were not readily apparent from other sources in the application of the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and
judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the estimates.

# 3.1 Critical judgements made in applying the Group’s accounting policies

# Determination of functional currency

The Group translates foreign currency items into the respective functional currencies of the Company and its
subsidiaries. In determining the functional currencies of the respective entities, judgement is used by the Group to
determine the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective entities operate. Consideration
factors include the currency that mainly influences sales prices of goods and services and the currency of the country
whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determines the sales prices of its goods and services.

# Capitalisation of development expenditure

The Group follows the guidance of SFRS(I) 1-38 Intangible Assets (“SFRS(I) 1-38”) in determining the amount and
nature of development expenditure to be capitalised as development costs. This determination requires significant
judgement. The Group assesses, among other factors, if the product or process is technically feasible and if the Group
has sufficient technical, financial and other resources to use or market the product or process. In addition, the Group
also applies its judgement to assess the probability of expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the
use of this capitalised development expenditure that will flow to the Group.

# 3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

# Impairment assessment of development expenditure

The Group determines whether there is any indication development expenditure may be impaired at least on an
annual basis. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, the Group also performed impairment
assessment annually for development expenditure not yet available for use by comparing its carrying value with its
recoverable amount. This requires an estimation of the probable future economic benefits that are expected to be
generated by the products, applications and processes that are developed by the Group.

The Group’s assessments are based on the estimation of the value-in-use of the assets defined in SFRS(I) 1-36
Impairment of Assets (“SFRS(I)1-36”) by forecasting the expected future cash flows for a period of up to 10 years, using
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In determining the value-in-use, the
Group has considered the key inputs, including the discount rate and growth rate, as well as key assumptions applied.
The discounted cash flows are derived from the budget prepared by the management and approved by the Board
of Directors and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future
investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable
amount is most sensitive to sales quantities forecasted for the existing and new products and the growth rate used
for extrapolation purposes.

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)

# 3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)

In preparing the budgets, management also assumed competitive but stable market conditions and continued acceptability of products sold. As a result, the Group has made an impairment loss of US$Nil (2023: US$600,000) in respect of its development expenditure as at 31 March 2024. The carrying value of the Group’s development expenditure as at 31 March 2024 is US$8,101,041 (2023: US$7,926,397). Further details of the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of development expenditure are disclosed in Note 15.

# Inventory valuation method

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Management reviews the Group’s inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventory and identifies items of inventory which have a market price, being the selling price quoted from the market of similar items, that is lower than its carrying amount. Management then estimates the amount of inventory loss as an allowance on inventory. Changes in demand levels, technological developments and pricing competition could affect the saleability and values of the inventory which could then consequentially impact the Group’s results, cash flows and financial position. The carrying amount of the Group’s inventories as at 31 March 2024 was US$7,276,516 (2023: US$4,898,776) (Note 16).

# Measurement of ECL of trade receivables

The Group assesses its trade receivables on an individual basis for any expected credit loss by considering all reasonable and supportable information, such as past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions of each debtor. The expected loss allowance on the Group’s trade receivables as at 31 March 2024 is US$2,254 (2023: US$6,000,000) (Note 40).

# Measurement of ECL of amounts due from subsidiaries

The Company uses amongst other factors, the financial position of the subsidiaries, the past financial performance and cash flow trends, adjusted for the outlook of the industry and economy in which the subsidiaries operate in. Impairment on these balances has been measured on 12–months expected loss basis which reflects low credit risk of the exposures. Using 12-month ECL, the expected loss allowance on the Company’s amounts due from subsidiaries as at 31 March 2024 is US$46,000 (2023: US$Nil) (Note 40).

# Impairment of investments in subsidiaries

At the end of each financial year, an assessment is made on whether there are indicators that the Group’s and the Company’s investments are impaired. Where necessary, the Group’s and Company’s assessments are based on the estimation of the value-in-use of the assets defined in SFRS(I) 1-36 by forecasting the expected future cash flows for a period of up to 5 years, using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In determining the value-in-use, the Company has considered the key inputs, including the discount rate and growth rate, as well as key assumptions applied. The Company’s carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries as at 31 March 2024 was US$19,085,001 (2023: US$19,085,001) (Note 13).

# 3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)

Useful lives of development expenditure

The cost of development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives to be 10 years. Changes in the expected useful lives or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Therefore, future amortisation charges could be revised. The carrying amount of the Group’s development expenditure included as intangible assets as at 31 March 2024 was US$8,101,041 (2023: US$7,926,397) (Note 15).

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment

The Group depreciates the property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives after taking into account of their estimated residual values. The estimated useful life reflects management’s estimate of the period that the Group intends to derive future economic benefits from the use of the Group’s property, plant and equipment. The residual value reflects management’s estimated amount that the Group would currently obtain from the disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, as if the asset was already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological developments could affect the economics, useful lives and the residual values of these assets which could then consequentially impact future depreciation charges. The carrying amount of the Group’s property, plant and equipment at 31 March 2024 was US$903,398 (2023: US$550,469) (Note 12).

Fair value of redeemable convertible bonds

Redeemable convertible bonds are measured at fair value at initial recognition and designated to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss. The key inputs contributing to the estimation uncertainty include Group’s share price volatility impact the valuation of the entire financial instruments, implied bond yield rates applied to future cash flows and uncertainties regarding the Group’s financial performance. The Group had applied binomial model to estimate the fair values of the bonds with conversion, redemption and warrants option. The carrying amount of the Group’s redeemable convertible bonds as at 31 March 2024 was US$3,395,652 (2023: US$3,560,764) (Note 28).

Fair value of convertible loan notes

Convertible loan notes are measured at fair value at initial recognition and designated to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss. The key inputs contributing to the estimation uncertainty include Group’s share price volatility impact the valuation of the entire financial instruments, implied bond yield rates applied to future cash flows and uncertainties regarding the Group’s financial performance. The Group had applied binomial model to estimate the fair values of the loan notes with conversion, redemption and warrants option. The warrants option has been bifurcated and thus has been accounted for derivative financial liabilities separately. (see below – fair value of derivative financial liabilities). The carrying amount of the Group’s convertible loan notes as at 31 March 2024 was US$707,162 (2023: US$Nil) (Note 27).

Fair value of derivative financial liabilities

Where the fair values of derivative financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using black scholes model. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing the fair values. The judgements include considerations of liquidity and model inputs regarding the financial performance of the Group, its risk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the investee operates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. The valuation of derivative financial liabilities is described in more details in Note 41.

Under the EIT Law, EIT applies to all enterprises, including Foreign Investment Enterprises (“FIEs”) and domestic enterprises. The general applicable EIT tax rate in the PRC is 25%. Under the EIT Law, dividends received by foreign investors from their investment in Chinese enterprises in respect of profits earned since 1 January 2008 are subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10% unless reduced by a treaty. Pursuant to a tax arrangement between the PRC and Singapore, the investment holding companies established in Singapore are subject to a reduced withholding tax rate of 5% on dividends they received from their PRC subsidiary.

The PRC subsidiary is subject to an applicable tax rate of 25% (2023: 25%) and withholding tax of 5% (2023: 5%) respectively.

# 10. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 10. EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE (CONTINUED)

The basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share is the same as the instruments were potentially anti-dilutive.

There were no potential dilutive ordinary shares of redeemable convertible bonds, convertible loan notes and warrants. Therefore, no shares were assumed to have been issued on the deemed exercise of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible bonds, convertible loan notes and warrants during the year ended 31 March 2024 and 2023. Accordingly, the diluted earnings/(loss) per share for financial year ended 31 March 2024 and 2023 was the same as the basic earnings/(loss) per share.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares for financial year ended 31 March 2024 was computed based on the issue and allotment of Nil (2023: 717,430,117) new ordinary shares as disclosed in Note 33.

In the previous financial year, the Company invested additional capital of US$7,536,000 in one of its subsidiaries, Addvalue Innovation Pte Ltd, by way of capitalising the amount receivable from Addvalue Innovation Pte Ltd.

The recoverable amount of investment in a subsidiary was determined based on the estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU by forecasting the expected future cash flows for a period up to 10 years, using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The Company had recognised impairment of US$Nil (2023:US$8,000,000) for the investment in Addvalue Innovation Pte Ltd as the subsidiary has been persistently making losses and hence, recoverable amount calculated as present values of estimated cash flows discounted using a discount rate of 19.0% (2023: 20.1%) is lower than the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiary.

# 15. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

Included in the development expenditure is an amount of US$5,280,745 (2023: US$4,504,737) pertaining to development projects not yet available for use.

The Group invests in development activities to build its base of proprietary products, applications and processes. The net carrying value of development expenditure amounting to US$8,101,041 (2023: US$7,926,397) represents development costs incurred for the development of various core technological elements in mobile satellite communication terminals and related applications, including radio frequency and antenna design, new embedded firmware and hardware systems, digital communication and baseband processing and application firmware to ensure continual innovation, competitiveness and future proof of terminal design and related applications. The carrying value of development expenditure is expected to be recovered from probable future economic benefits that are expected to be generated from the sales of the wide portfolio of existing products and the commercial exploitation of related applications over the useful mobile satellite service lifetime. The amortisation of development expenditure amounting to US$601,366 (2023: US$614,949) was charged to other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.

The individual development projects of which respective carrying amounts are more than 10% of the total intangible assets in either 2024 or 2023 are as follows:

| |Group|2024|2023|
|---|---|---|---|
|Carrying amount|US$|US$| |
|Project 1|1,369,786|1,615,118| |
|Project 2 (In progress)|3,233,731|3,116,875| |
|Project 3|1,053,989|1,185,740| |

Included in the development expenditure are the capitalisation of the employee benefits expense of US$643,389 for the current financial year (2023: US$662,709).

Development expenditure for Project 2 is net of government grant received during the current financial year amounting to US$Nil (2023: US$788,250).

# Impairment losses of development expenditure

For the purpose of impairment testing, development expenditure has been allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) as follows:

| |Group|2024|2023|
|---|---|---|---|
|Satellite communication (“Satcom”)| |11,573|113,381|
|Advance Digital Radio Solutions (“ADRS”)| |636,928|724,419|
|Space Connectivity (“SPC”)| |7,452,540|7,088,597|
| | |8,101,041|7,926,397|

The recoverable amounts of the remaining CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management.

The calculations of value-in-use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

| | | |Advance Digital Radio| |Space| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Satcom| | |2024|2023|2024|2023|2024|2023|
|Growth rates (1)|-3% to 47%|-38% to 19%|0% to 51%|-2% to 169%|0% to 59%|0% to 90%| | | |
|Discount rate (2)|19.0%|20.1%|23.7%|20.1%|23.9%|20.1%| | | |
|Cash flow projections (years)|10|10|10|10|10|10| | | |

(1) Annual growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows are based on past performance and the market development adjusted for the specific circumstances of the CGU and based on management’s experience.

(2) The discount rate applied is based on the weighted average cost of the Group’s capital (the “WACC”), adjusted for the specific circumstances of the CGUs, and based on management’s experience, and grossed-up to arrive at the pre-tax rate.

Based on the value-in-use, impairment losses amounting to US$Nil (2023: US$600,000) was recognised in “Other operating expenses” (Note 6) for the financial year ended 31 March 2024. The impairment losses are included in the segment result of Asia Pacific region as the development expenditure is located in Singapore.

|Trade receivables| |3,451,053|8,228,792|
|Less: loss allowance (Note 40)| |(2,254)|(6,000,000)|
| | |3,448,799|2,228,792|

The Group’s trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally ranging from 0 to 60 (2023: 0 to 60) days term. They are recognised at their original invoice amounts which represent their fair values on initial recognition.

Trade receivables include an amount of US$Nil (2023: US$6,000,000) pertaining to a one-off licensing income. The settlement of the consideration will be at the option of the trade debtor, either by way of cash or issuance of shares to the Group. The customer had opted to issue shares to settle the outstanding trade receivable. On 29 May 2020, the customer entered into an addendum to extend the deadline for the transfer of shares to 15 July 2020 and both parties agreed that the shares of the customer to be issued to the Group shall be worth US$6,000,000 based on the fund raising to be concluded by the customer. On 17 August 2020, the customer issued a trust deed to the Group stating that they had earmarked to issue a minimum of 2,000,000 shares valued at US$3 each for the settlement. On 29 September 2020, management entered into another addendum with the customer to further extend the deadline for the transfer of shares to 31 December 2021. On 1 January 2022, management entered into another addendum with the customer to further extend the deadline for the transfer of shares to 31 December 2022. In consideration of the delays of the transfer of the shares by the customer and the heightened volatility and uncertainty in the economic environment that the customer operates in, the management is of the view that there has been a significant increase in credit risk relating to the receivable since initial recognition. With reference to SFRS(I) 9, accordingly, the Group recorded a loss allowance of US$6,000,000 since 2022. The amount remains outstanding as of 31 March 2024 and the loss allowance has been written off as at 31 March 2024 as there is no further update from the trade debtor and the amount was deemed uncollectible.

# 31. CONTRACT LIABILITIES

Contract liabilities relate to advances received for sales of goods. Revenue for sales of goods is recognised at the point
in time although the customer pays for the services at the contract inception date. A contract liability is recognised
for the advances received from the customers and is recognised as and when the performance obligation is satisfied.

Contract liabilities for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 increased due to more advances received with the new
order of contracts during the financial year.

The Group’s revenue recognised in the financial years that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the
beginning of the respective financial years is as follows:

As at the end of the financial year, the total amount of loans drawn-down and outstanding covered by the guarantees are US$100,266 (2023: US$484,957). Such guarantees are in the form of a financial guarantee as they require the Company to reimburse the respective financial institutions if the subsidiary to which the guarantees were extended fail to make principal or interest repayments when due in accordance with the terms of the borrowings. There has been no default or non-repayment since the utilisation of the facility.

As at the end of the financial year, the Company had also given undertakings to certain subsidiaries to provide continued financial support to these subsidiaries to enable them to operate as going concerns and to meet their obligations as and when they fall due for at least 12 months from the financial year end.

# 39. SEGMENT INFORMATION

For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their geographical areas as the Group’s risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by geographical areas.

The Group is engaged in a single business of sales of telecommunication equipment and related products and components and provision of related design services. During the reporting years, the Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units. For each of the strategic business units, the directors review internal management reports on a regular basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:

- Segment 1: EMEA included sales made to customers based in Spain, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), Denmark and other countries within the region;
- Segment 2: North America included sales made to customers based in United States of America and other countries within the region;
- Segment 3: Asia Pacific included sales made to customers based in Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, China, Philippines, Australia, Japan and other countries within the region.

Except as indicated above, no operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Group’s financing (including finance costs) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. There is no transfer pricing between operating segments as there is no inter-segment transaction.

Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

The Group operates from Asia Pacific region. Segment assets and liabilities for other segments (EMEA and North America) mainly includes the balances with the customers or suppliers located in the respective regions. Other segment assets (mainly comprising intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and inventories) and other segment liabilities are presented based on its location, being the Asia Pacific region.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISKS

The Group’s activities expose it to credit risk, market risks (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise adverse effects from the volatility of financial markets on the Group’s financial performance.

The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the objectives and underlying principles of financial risk management for the Group. The management then establishes the detailed policies such as authority levels, oversight responsibilities, risk identification and measurement, exposure limits and hedging strategies, in accordance with the objectives and underlying principles approved by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee provides independent oversight to the effectiveness of the risk management process. It is and has been throughout the current and previous financial year, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes shall be undertaken.

There have been no changes to the Group’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis indicated below.

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluation of its counterparties’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral.

The Group’s and Company’s major classes of financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables. Bank balances are mainly deposits with banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and the Group does not expect the impairment loss from bank balances to be material, if any.

To assess and manage its credit risk, the Group categorises the aforementioned financial assets according to their risk of default. The Group defines default to have taken place when internal or/and external information indicates that the financial asset is unlikely to be received, which could include a breach of debt covenant, default of interest due for more than 30 days, but not later than when the financial asset is more than 90 days past due as per SFRS(I) 9’s presumption.

Due to the nature of the industry that the Group operates in where repayment periods are generally longer and the industry and Group’s customary practise, the Group has rebutted the presumption included in SFRS(I) 9 that there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition when financial assets are more than 30 days past due. The Group has determined that there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition when financial assets are more than 90 days past due.

In their assessment, the management considers, amongst other factors, the latest relevant credit ratings from reputable external rating agencies where available and deemed appropriate, historical credit experiences, latest available financial information and latest applicable credit reputation of the debtor.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024  153

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISKS (CONTINUED)

# Credit risk (Continued)

The Group’s internal credit risk grading categories are as follows:

|Category|Description|Basis of recognising ECL|
|---|---|---|
|1|Low credit riskNote 1|12-months ECL|
|2|Non-significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and financial asset is ≤ 90 days past due|12-months ECL|
|3|Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognitionNote 2 or financial asset is > 90 days past due|Lifetime ECL|
|4|Evidence indicates that financial asset is credit-impairedNote 3|Difference between financial asset’s gross carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate|
|5|Evidence indicates that the management has no reasonable expectations of recovering the write off amountNote 4|Written-off|

# Note 1. Low credit risk

The financial asset is determined to have low credit risk if the financial assets have a low risk of default, the counterparty has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the counterparty to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. Generally, this is the case when the Group assesses and determines that the debtor has been, is in and is highly likely to be, in the foreseeable future and during the (contractual) term of the financial asset, in a financial position that will allow the debtor to settle the financial asset as and when it falls due.

# Note 2. Significant increase in credit risk

In assessing whether the credit risk of the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of default occurring on the financial asset as of reporting date with the risk of default occurring on the financial asset as of date of initial recognition, and considered reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition. In assessing the significance of the change in the risk of default, the Group considers both past due (i.e. whether it is more than 90 days past due) and forward looking quantitative and qualitative information. Forward looking information includes the assessment of the latest performance and financial position of the debtor, adjusted for the Group’s future outlook of the industry in which the debtor operates based on independently obtained information (e.g. expert reports, analyst’s reports etc.) and the most recent news or market talks about the debtor, as applicable. In its assessment, the Group will generally, for example, assess whether the deterioration of the financial performance and/or financial position, adverse change in the economic environment (country and industry in which the debtor operates), deterioration of credit risk of the debtor, etc. is in line with its expectation as of the date of initial recognition of the financial asset. Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contract payments are >90 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2024

# 40. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISKS (CONTINUED)

# Credit risk (Continued)

# Note 3. Credit impaired

In determining whether financial assets are credit-impaired, the Group assesses whether one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the following observable data:

- Significant financial difficulty of the debtor;
- Breach of contract, such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;
- It is becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- The disappearance of an active market for the financial asset because of financial difficulties.

# Note 4. Write off

Generally, the Group writes off, partially or fully, the financial asset when it assesses that there is no realistic prospect of recovery of the amount as evidenced by, for example, the debtor’s lack of assets or income sources that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subjected to the write-off.

The Group performs ongoing credit evaluation of its counterparties’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral.

The Group and Company do not have any significant credit exposure to any single counterparty or any groups of counterparties having similar characteristics.

With reference to Note 26, the Company provides financial guarantees to certain banks and other financial institutions in respect of facilities granted to one of its subsidiaries. The date when the Group becomes a committed party to the guarantee is considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purpose of assessing the financial asset for impairment. In determining whether there has been a significant risk of a default occurring on the drawn-down facilities, the Group considered the change in the risk that the specified debtor (i.e. the applicable subsidiaries) will default on the contract. The Company assessed that the credit risk relating to the financial guarantees is insignificant to the Company.

As at the end of the financial year, there was significant concentration of credit risk. Trade receivables from 3 (2023: 3) customers accounted for approximately 79% (2023: 80%) of total trade receivables of the Group. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statements of financial position.

# Trade receivables (Note 17)

The Group uses the practical expedient under SFRS(I) 9 in the form of allowance matrix to measure the ECL for trade receivables, where the loss allowance is equal to lifetime ECL.

The ECL for trade receivables are estimated using an allowance matrix by reference to the historical credit loss experience of the customers for the last 3 years prior to the respective reporting dates for various customer groups that are assessed by geographical locations, product types and internal ratings, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment which could affect the ability of the debtors to settle the financial assets. In considering the impact of the economic environment on the ECL rates, the Group assesses, for example, the gross domestic production growth rates of the countries (eg. Singapore, United States of America, Japan) and the growth rates of the major industries which its customers operate in.

# Trade receivables (Note 17) (Continued)

Trade receivables are written off when there is evidence to indicate that the customer is in severe financial difficulty such as being under liquidation or bankruptcy and there are no reasonable expectations for recovering the outstanding balances.

The age analysis of trade receivables is as follows:

| |Group|2024|2023|
|---|---|---|---|
|Not past due and not impaired| |1,864,358|2,051,412|

# Other receivables (Note 18)

As of 31 March 2024, the Group recorded gross other receivables and deposits of US$357,053 and US$159,407 (2023: US$477,044 and US$159,407) respectively. The Group assessed the loss allowance of these amounts on a lifetime ECL basis consequent to their assessment and conclusion that these other receivables and deposits are of low credit risk except for one of the other receivables amounted to US$Nil (2023: US$380,700), which have financial difficulties. In its assessment of the credit risk of the other receivables, the Group considered amongst other factors, the financial position of the other receivables as of 31 March 2024, the past financial performance and cashflow trends, adjusted for the outlook of the industry and economy in which the receivables operate in. Using lifetime ECL, the Group determined that the ECL is US$Nil (2023: US$380,700).

# Due from subsidiaries (Note 20)

As of 31 March 2024, the Company recorded other receivables from subsidiaries of US$8,320,997 (2023: US$8,000,901) consequent to an extension of loans to the subsidiaries. The Company assessed the loss allowance of these amounts on a 12-month ECL basis consequent to their assessment and conclusion that these receivables are of low credit risk. In its assessment of the credit risk of the subsidiaries, the Company considered amongst other factors, the financial position of the subsidiaries as of 31 March 2024, the past financial performance and cashflow trends, adjusted for the outlook of the industry and economy in which the subsidiaries operate in. Using 12-month ECL, the Company determined that the ECL is US$46,000 (2023: US$Nil).

# Foreign exchange risk sensitivity

The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% (2023: 10%) increase and decrease in the relevant foreign currencies against the functional currency of each Group entity. 10% (2023: 10%) is the sensitivity rate representing management’s assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% (2023: 10%) change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where they give rise to an impact on the Group’s profit or loss.

If the relevant foreign currency strengthens by 10% (2023: 10%) against the functional currency of each Group entity, with all other variables held constant, profit or loss for the year and equity will increase/(decrease) by:

| |Singapore dollar|US$| |
|---|---|---|---|
|2024|Group|Profit for the year|(582,857)|
| |Company|Loss for the year|(426,180)|
|2023|Group|Loss for the year|(468,077)|
| |Company|Loss for the year|(360,733)|

A 10% weakening of functional currency of each Group entity against the above currencies would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above.

# Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group’s interest rate risk relates to interest bearing liabilities.

The Group’s policy is to maintain an efficient and optimal interest cost structure using a combination of fixed and variable rate debts, and long and short-term borrowings.

Interests on the Group’s loans (Note 26) are on fixed rates that prevail until the maturity of the instruments. No other financial instruments of the Group are subject to interest rate risk.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refer to the risk in which the Group encounters difficulties in meeting its short-term obligations. Liquidity risk is managed by matching the payment and receipt cycle.

The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring the availability of funding through committed credit facilities from a bank and financial institutions. In addition, the Group has also sought for investment funds via issuing of shares and convertible loans to finance its cash flow and operations.

# 41. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

The fair values of applicable assets and liabilities are determined and categorised using a fair value hierarchy as follows:

- (a) Level 1 – the fair values of assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and which trade in active markets that the Group can access at the measurement date are determined with reference to quoted market prices (unadjusted).
- (b) Level 2 – in the absence of quoted market prices, the fair values of the assets and liabilities are determined using the other observable, either directly or indirectly, inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets or included within Level 1, quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in non-active markets.
- (c) Level 3 – in the absence of quoted market prices included within Level 1 and observable inputs included within Level 2, the fair values of the remaining assets and liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models.

Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

# 42. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through optimisation of debt and equity balance except where decisions are made to exit businesses or close companies.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debts, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 25 and equity attributable to owners of the Company, comprising issued capital, retained earnings and reserves as disclosed in Notes 33 to 36 respectively and statements of changes in equity.

The Group’s management reviews the capital structure on a regular basis. As part of this review, management considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. Upon review, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares and share buybacks. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 31 March 2023.

Management monitors capital based on a gearing ratio of less than one. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total liabilities (excluding income tax payable and deferred tax liabilities as shown in the statements of financial position), less cash and bank balances. Total capital is calculated as total equity as shown in the statements of financial position, plus net debt.

| |Group|Group|Company|Company|
|---|---|---|
| |2024|2023|2024|2023|
|Total liabilities|14,387,300|9,164,208|5,823,658|5,017,357|
|Less: Cash and bank balances|(535,293)|(151,289)|(368)|(820)|
|Net debt|13,852,007|9,012,919|5,823,290|5,016,537|
|Total equity|6,133,489|5,831,140|21,595,322|22,097,656|
|Total capital|19,985,496|14,844,059|27,418,612|27,114,193|
|Gearing ratio|0.69|0.61|0.21|0.19|
