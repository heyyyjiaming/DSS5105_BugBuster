# LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Audience Analytics Limited, I am pleased to present to you our Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (“FY2022”).

Despite prevailing economic headwinds over the past 12 months, we remained steadfast in our mission of becoming a value-driven growth partner for businesses across Asia. We forged ahead with determination, ramping up our expansion strategy with the acquisition of the intellectual property rights to the Golden Bull Award. With the prestigious brand added to the Group’s existing portfolio of award programs, we are looking ahead to our next chapter of growth as one of Asia’s leading business enablers.

DATUK WILLIAM NG
Chairman and Managing Director

# OUR IMPACT IN NUMBERS

As governments relaxed social distancing measures around the world, we were able to gradually increase activity in our Business Impact Assessment and Recognition and Exhibitions segments. This led to a surge in revenue by 43% from S$9.9 million in FY2021 to S$14.1 million in FY2022 - an outstanding result that was further bolstered by increased participation in our award programs as well as a 66.1% rise in revenue from our signature Malaysia Career & Training Fair.

After closing the year with a 35% jump in net profit, the Group proposed to increase its dividend payout by 43%. Our sustained profitability even in the face of exceptional circumstances is a testament to the scalability of our business and our growing presence in the region. Overall, our financial position remains strong, with a positive operating cash flow of S$7.2 million in FY2022.

Celebrating the successes of the award program participants in-person has been a welcome return to normalcy. It puts us in a prime position to charge ahead with our regional expansion goals and advance our cross-selling efforts by leveraging our network of 500,000 engaged business owners and decision makers. The easing of China’s Zero-COVID policy and Malaysia’s record-high economic growth in 22 years also give us reason to believe that a positive upsurge in business activity is on the horizon.

# OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM YOU

Finally, on behalf of our entire Board of Directors, I would like to express gratitude for the faith you have kept in us over the last year. Thanks to your support, we...

# AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED | Annual Report 2022

# REVIEW OF GROUP PERFORMANCE

# REVENUE

The Group’s revenue increased by approximately S$4.25 million from S$9.88 million in FY2021 to S$14.13 million in FY2022, mainly due to (i) an increase in revenue from the Business Impact Assessment and Recognition segment by S$4.00 million or 42.8% attributable mainly to an increase in the number of participants, and (ii) an increase in revenue from the Exhibitions segment by S$0.26 million or 66.1%, mainly attributable to two exhibitions for the Malaysia Career & Training Fair being held in FY2022 as compared to one in FY2021.

In FY2022, the Group reported an increase in revenue in these geographical segments, notably in Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Thailand. The increase in revenue in these geographical segments was mainly due to higher demand from the Business Impact Assessment and Recognition segment.

# DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES

Distribution and marketing expenses increased by approximately S$7,000 from approximately S$40,000 in FY2021 to S$47,000 in FY2022, mainly due to an increase in traveling expenses and accommodation expenses of approximately S$6,000 and increase in promotion and advertising expenses of approximately S$7,000, partially offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of approximately S$6,000.

# ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Administrative expenses increased by S$0.10 million from S$1.74 million in FY2021 to S$1.84 million in FY2022, mainly due to an increase in staff costs (inclusive of directors’ remuneration and incentive bonus), and partially offset by a decrease in legal and professional fees with the completion of the Company’s IPO in FY2021.

# COST OF SALES

Cost of sales increased by approximately S$1.67 million from S$3.36 million in FY2021 to S$5.03 million in FY2022. This was mainly due to (i) an increase in event-related costs such as cost of venue, production cost and performance cost as the Group hosted physical events in Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan in FY2022, while the Group hosted virtual events in FY2021, and (ii) an increase in staff costs such as commission which increased in tandem with the higher revenue in FY2022.

# GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit increased by S$2.59 million from S$6.51 million in FY2021 to S$9.10 million in FY2022, mainly due to increased gross profit contribution from the Business Impact Assessment and Recognition segment in FY2022, as compared to FY2021. Gross profit margin decreased marginally by 1.6 percentage points from 66.0% in FY2021 to 64.4% in FY2022.

# OTHER INCOME

Other income decreased by approximately S$0.23 million from S$0.33 million in FY2021 to S$0.10 million in FY2022, mainly due to the absence of grant received from the Monetary Authority of Singapore of S$0.21 million upon the successful listing of the Company (“Listing”) on the Catalist board of the SGX-ST in FY2021.

# PROFIT BEFORE TAX

As a result of the above, profit before tax increased by approximately S$1.98 million from S$5.17 million in FY2021 to S$7.15 million in FY2022.

# TAX EXPENSE

Tax expense increased by S$0.50 million from S$0.96 million in FY2021 to S$1.46 million in FY2022 mainly due to higher profit before tax generated by the Group in FY2022.

# REVIEW OF GROUP’S FINANCIAL POSITION

# Property, Plant and Equipment

The increase in plant and equipment of S$0.15 million from S$0.07 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$0.22 million as at 31 December 2022, was mainly due to the purchase of motor vehicle of approximately S$0.17 million and purchase of computer equipment of approximately S$0.02 million, which was partially offset by depreciation of plant and equipment of approximately S$0.04 million.

# Right-Of-Use Assets

The decrease in the right-of-use assets of S$0.03 million from S$0.15 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$0.12 million as at 31 December 2022 was mainly due to depreciation of right-of-use assets for hire purchases of motor vehicles, which was partially offset by the addition of warehouse unit during the year.

# Intangible Asset

The Group acquired the intellectual property rights for the Golden Bull Award in FY2022.

# Deferred Tax Assets

Deferred tax assets decreased by S$0.03 million from S$0.10 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$0.07 million as at 31 December 2022, due to net tax credited to profit or loss on contract liabilities and tax charged to profit or loss on utilisation of tax losses during the financial year.

# CURRENT ASSETS

Trade and other receivables decreased by S$0.31 million from S$1.66 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$1.35 million as at 31 December 2022, mainly due to a decrease in trade receivables as a result of an improvement on the collection of trade receivables in FY2022.

# REVIEW OF STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

# NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES

# Contract Liabilities

The non-current portion of contract liabilities are recognised when the Group has not performed under the contract but bills customers in advance or receives advance payments from customers. The non-current portion of contract liabilities decreased by approximately S$4,000 from approximately S$8,000 as at 31 December 2021 to approximately S$4,000 as at 31 December 2022, mainly due to progressive performance of contracts in FY2022.

# Lease Liabilities

The non-current portion of lease liabilities decreased by approximately S$0.03 million from S$0.09 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$0.06 million as at 31 December 2022, mainly due to the repayment of lease liabilities for motor vehicles and warehouse rental.

# Tax Payable

Tax payables increased by S$0.43 million from S$0.63 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$1.06 million as at 31 December 2022, driven by higher profit before tax generated by the Group during FY2022.

# Trade And Other Payables

Trade and other payables increased by S$0.54 million from S$0.82 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$1.36 million as at 31 December 2022, mainly due to an increase in accruals for event commission and incentive bonus. Such increase in accruals in FY2022 is in line with the increase in the Group’s revenue in FY2022.

# Contract Liabilities

The current portion of contract liabilities increased by S$0.12 million from S$0.67 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$0.79 million as at 31 December 2022, mainly due to an increased number of contracts from the Business Impact Assessment and Recognition segment and from the Exhibitions segment that the Group had billed in advance or received advance payments from towards the end of FY2022.

# Working Capital

The Group recorded a positive working capital of S$15.51 million as at 31 December 2022, as compared to a positive working capital of S$12.35 million as at 31 December 2021.

# Cash Flows

Net cash used in financing activities amounting to S$2.17 million was mainly related to payment of dividends to shareholders of S$2.12 million and repayment of lease liabilities of S$0.05 million.

As a result of the above, cash and cash equivalents increased from S$12.80 million as at 31 December 2021 to S$17.41 million as at 31 December 2022.

Net cash used in investing activities of approximately S$0.28 million was due to (i) the purchase of property, plant and equipment of S$0.19 million, (ii) purchase of intangible assets of S$0.17 million, and partially offset by proceed from disposal of right-of-use asset of S$0.05 million and interest received of S$0.03 million.

As governments lift pandemic restrictions and people return to their normal lives, the challenges of inflation rate hikes and supply chain shortages present new obstacles to the anticipated economic recovery. Nevertheless, the business community’s unwavering determination to push ahead gives us much reason to feel optimistic about an imminent improvement in market conditions in the coming months. In the meantime, the Group will continue to encourage this forward-looking mindset through its work of recognising excellence in business.

# GROUP (As at 31 December 2022)

# STRUCTURE

Our operations in key markets, such as Singapore and Malaysia, have experienced a fresh burst of activity since the return of live events. We believe this is just the start of a new wave of opportunities brought on by a culmination of record-breaking GDP growth in Malaysia and the reopening of borders in China. The strengthening economic tailwinds in the region presents us with an opportune environment to press ahead with our expansion plans.

Organisations today are faced with the growing challenge of having to retain their top performers while trying to create a more inclusive workplace culture. As a result, more employers are seeking outside expertise to understand their employees better. We believe this thirst to improve employee satisfaction will be a key driver of demand in the Group’s Exhibitions segment as well as its flagship HR Asia recognition program.

While risks of economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism still present us with major challenges, the Group is confident that its cautious approach along with its strong margins and healthy cash reserves will help us remain resilient in adverse circumstances. Going forward, we will continue to focus on talent acquisition and retention to increase our capacity for growth.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# BOARD STATEMENT

We are pleased to present our second annual sustainability report (the “Sustainability Report” or “Report”) of Audience Analytics Limited (“AAL” or the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”), outlining our sustainability performance for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (“FY2022”).

# Reporting Scope

Unless otherwise stated, this Report covers the Group’s strategies, initiatives, and performance data in relation to material Economic, Environmental, Social and Governance (“EESG”) issues for FY2022. The scope of this report covers all the entities listed in our Group Structure as follows:

|Audience Analytics Limited|(Singapore)|
|---|---|
|Business Media International Sdn. Bhd.|(Malaysia)|
|BMI Business Intelligence Pte. Ltd.|(Singapore)|
|Business Media International Limited|(Hong Kong)|
|AIC Exhibitions Sdn. Bhd.|(Malaysia)|

In FY2022, we saw countries opening their borders, in-person activities resuming, and businesses slowly recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a resurgence of confidence and spending in the business sector. This boost in consumer confidence fuelled the Company’s growth over the past year, resulting in a 43% increase in revenue and 35% increase in net profits. However, the impact of the global climate crisis is becoming increasingly apparent, with rising temperatures, flash floods, and water shortages affecting cities in Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. AAL remains committed to taking an active role in addressing these challenges, and this Report highlights our ongoing efforts to engage in responsible business practices, invest in our people, products, and services, while also reducing our environmental footprint.

Over the past year, we successfully met our revenue targets, following the easing of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and an increase in the number of participants in our business awards. In FY2022, we have also acquired the intellectual property (“IP”) rights for the prestigious Golden Bull Award. Additionally, as part of our ongoing drive to digitalise the Group’s business operations, we published the winners’ profiles from our business awards programs online instead of printing hard-copy books, resulting in an estimated reduction of 1.5 million sheets of paper consumption in FY2022. We remain steadfast in our commitment to further our employees’ personal and professional growth by partnering with local educational institutions to provide specialised courses for our employees.

# Reporting Framework

This Report has been prepared in accordance with the latest version of the Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”) Standards – the GRI Universal Standards 2021 – selected for the comprehensive guidance and standardised approach it offers to sustainability reporting. The Board plays an integral role in providing oversight over the identification, management and monitoring of the Group’s material EESG factors. With the long-standing support of the Board, the Group is committed to actively engaging both our current and prospective stakeholders on their interests and concerns. We aim to build strong partnerships and advance our sustainability efforts, with the end goal of generating long-term value for all stakeholders.

In compliance with Rules 711A and 711B of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”), this Report includes the primary components of a sustainability report on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. AAL has opted not to comply with the requirement to include climate-related disclosures in FY2022, as the Company is still completing a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to our business. We will continue to monitor and periodically assess the need to include climate-related disclosures that are aligned with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) in future sustainability reports.

# Data Assurance

We greatly appreciate the continued support of AAL’s management team, our employees, our partners and the stakeholders who have been an integral part of our sustainability journey thus far, and we look forward to working together with all of you to achieve our sustainability goals in the future.

DATUK WILLIAM NG
Chairman and Managing Director

We have relied on internal data monitoring and verification to ensure the accuracy of the data and information presented in this Report. AAL has not sought external assurance for our Sustainability Report and will consider doing so in the future.

# Feedback and Accessibility

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Our materiality assessment process shapes the development of our EESG strategy and helps us to direct our resources towards creating long-term value for our stakeholders. In FY2021, the Group engaged an external consultant to carry out the materiality assessment process, which comprises the following four stages:

IDENTIFY1
PRIORITISE2
VALIDATE3
REVIEW4

The material EESG topics were identified through internal focus group discussions as a representation of external stakeholder groups. These topics were then mapped to the GRI Topic Standards, and their impacts assessed in the context of AAL’s business strategy and operations. Shortlisted material EESG topics were internally validated by the Board.

The Group continuously monitors changes in our business environment, stakeholder feedback, and emerging sustainability trends that may result in a need to reassess our material topics. We have reviewed the EESG topics identified in FY2021 and assessed that they remain material to our business and our stakeholders.

The following table summarises AAL’s commitments and performance in FY2022, against previously established targets for each material EESG topic, and sets forth our short-, medium- and long-term goals for each material topic.

|EESG Topics|Our Commitments|Targets for FY2022|Our Performance in FY2022|Short-term|Medium-term|Long-term|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Economic Performance|To generate long-term value for our stakeholders, by maintaining consistent profits, a robust balance sheet and strong operating cash flows|To meet our revenue targets and introduce our existing awards in new geographical markets|We achieved an increase in revenue and net profits and expanded AAL’s regional presence by introducing the HR Asia Awards in India.|To meet our revenue targets|To extend existing business segment such as our products and services to new geographical markets.|To establish complementary business segments for the Group to ensure our continued growth.|

# ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

We are committed to pursuing economic growth that is sustainable in the long run. Our aim is to achieve our revenue goals and expand into new markets, with the intention of creating value not just for our shareholders, but for all our stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, local communities, and for the environment.

AAL has continued to achieve consistent financial growth in FY2022. Our revenue rose by 43%, from S$9.9 million in FY2021 to S$14.1 million in FY2022. This was due to the economy rebounding strongly and the growing presence of the Group across the Pan-Asian region in the past year. This growth is reflected in our gross profit, which increased from S$6.5 million in FY2021 to S$9.1 million in FY2022. A breakdown of the Group’s revenue, by business segments, is as follows:

|By Business Segments (S$)|FY2022|FY2021|FY2020|
|---|---|---|---|
|Business Impact Assessment and Recognition|13,342,390|9,344,436|7,306,472|
|Exhibitions|642,962|387,110|138,362|
|Business Media and Analytics|148,439|144,353|174,927|

In FY2022, a substantial portion of the economic value we created was allocated among various stakeholders. The following details a breakdown of our operating expenses:

|(S$)|FY2022|FY2021|FY2020|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cost of Sales|5,031,837|3,361,549|2,617,377|
|Administrative Expenses|1,839,130|1,742,649|1,339,909|
|Tax Expense|1,460,365|959,875|714,921|

As a result, our net profit for FY2022 stood at S$5.7 million (FY2021: S$4.2 million), and the earnings per share based on profit attributable to equity holders of the Company amounted to 3.38 S$ cents (FY2021: 2.50 S$ cents).

Our Sales and Management team holds weekly meetings to discuss upcoming projects, review the number of clients we have onboarded for each project, and seek out new sales opportunities. In addition, we have also engaged an investor relationship agency and implemented a Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) system to help us manage customer database, automate sales and marketing processes, and track customers’ communications.

To enhance our profitability and competitiveness, we have been working on the digitalisation of our business and operations. In FY2022, we fully automated the survey for our HR Asia Awards. Given our limited manpower, we recognise the importance of utilising technology to automate business processes and maximise our economies of scale.

AAL currently operates in 15 markets across Asia and we believe that we are well-positioned to be at the epicentre of the region’s post-pandemic growth. We see a strong demand of participants for our award programs in our existing markets, and will continue to search for new opportunities to expand into new geographic markets to grow our existing businesses and brands.

# EMPLOYMENT

We recognise that our employees are our greatest resource and are essential to the long-term success of our business. Therefore, we are committed to being a responsible employer that prioritises the well-being of our workforce, for we believe that a healthy and happy workforce leads to increased productivity. We are constantly reviewing and enhancing our employee benefits to provide better incentives and support.

As of 31 December 2022, AAL’s workforce comprised 66 permanent, full-time employees (as of 31 December 2021, 71 employees1), with one employee based in Singapore and the rest located in Malaysia. While we observe some fluctuations in our employee count throughout the year, these have no significant impact on our business operations. A breakdown of our employee figures, by gender and age group, is as follows:

|Employees by Gender|Employees by Age Group|
|---|---|
|Male|21 - 30 years|
|Female|31 - 45 years|
| |46 - 60 years|

In FY2022, 2 female employees benefitted from our parental leave policy, both of whom returned to work after their parental leave ended, marking a return-to-work rate of 100%. In FY2021, 2 employees took and returned from parental leave, and both remained employed with the Group in FY2022, marking a retention rate of 100%.

For more information on the Group’s financial performance, please refer to AAL’s FY2022 Annual Report.

1 We have restated the employment figures for FY2021 after standardising the definitions and measurement methodologies for the relevant metrics.

# AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED

# Annual Report 2022

# EMPLOYMENT (cont’d)

In addition, we organised various after-work recreational activities and sports events for our employees to participate in, as well as a health and wellness program that rewards employees for maintaining a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) each month. We believe that a healthy and engaged workforce is essential to our success.

To acknowledge and retain key talent, the Company has rolled out several employee participation plans, including the “Shared Purpose and Prosperity Incentive Plan” (SPRINT) and the “Group Employee Share Option Scheme” (Group ESOS). SPRINT is a performance-based incentive plan that rewards employees for meeting or exceeding established targets, while Group ESOS is a share option scheme that enables employees to purchase the Company’s shares at a discounted price. These initiatives demonstrate the Company’s commitment to its employees, and its belief that a motivated and engaged workforce is essential to achieving its goals.

# TRAINING AND EDUCATION

As the business landscape continues to evolve and change rapidly, it is essential for companies to invest in their employees and provide them with opportunities for skill development. At AAL, we believe that investing in our people is crucial for maintaining a competitive workforce.

To support our employees’ growth, we offer both in-house training and on-the-job guidance. In addition, we encourage our employees to seek external training and education opportunities that align with their personal and professional development goals. During FY2022, we supported 35 of our employees in taking entrepreneurship courses at HELP University ELM Graduate School (FY2021: 32).

We recognise the importance of investing in our employees’ growth and development and hence offer comprehensive training programs to all eligible employees to enhance their skills and competencies. Our training policy is applicable to all employees, regardless of gender or age group, and we are committed to supporting our employees in their self-development and providing them with the tools and resources they need to succeed in their careers at AAL.

|No. of New Hires|By Gender| | |By Age Group| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Female|Male|21 - 30 years|31 - 45 years|46 - 60 years|Above 60 years|
|FY2021|12|25|17|14|6|0|
|FY2022|18|13|12|14|5|0|

|No. of Resignees|By Gender| | |By Age Group| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |Female|Male|21 - 30 years|31 - 45 years|46 - 60 years|Above 60 years| | | |
|FY2021|13|19|14|17|1|0| | | |
|FY2022|15|21|20|10|6|0| | | |

As part of AAL’s performance-management process, we provide our employees with regular performance and career development reviews. In FY2022, 100% of all eligible staff underwent an annual performance and career development review. This not only allows us to understand how we can better support our employees, but it also provides a fair and transparent method for evaluating their suitability for a promotion or salary increase.

We noted an increase in the number of resignees, due to lower confirmation rates for our probation staff and the tight labour market we faced in FY2022. To improve staff retention rates, the Company has undertaken several measures, which included reviewing our compensation and benefits packages, providing additional training opportunities, and soliciting feedback from employees during their appraisal sessions to identify areas for improvement. Our employees play a critical role in the Company’s success, and we believe that by taking these steps, we will be able to improve talent retention rates and achieve our goal of reaching a total staff count of 100 by 2024.

We have restated the average training hours for FY2021 (previously stated as 9.2 hours) following a recalculation of our average staff headcount.

| |FY2021|FY2022|
|---|---|---|
|Total training hours|688|708|
|Average staff headcount|68.5|68.5|
|Average training hours|10.0|10.3|

# AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED | Annual Report 2022

# OPTIMISING RESOURCE USAGE

As a Group, we are dedicated to do our part for the environment by reducing our resource consumption. In particular, event collaterals, business media magazines, and other printed documents account for a large proportion of our environmental footprint. In recognition of the large amount of energy, water and resources that go into the production, distribution, use and disposal of paper, we are actively exploring different ways to cut down on our printing activities and lower our environmental impact.

# PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IP protection is essential to fostering innovation and preserving our competitive advantage as a Group. We are dedicated to safeguarding the Group’s IP, including but not limited to our proprietary business analytic tools, and media brands, and business awards. At the same time, we abide by all relevant laws and regulations by respecting the IP rights of others.

We take a proactive approach to acquiring, managing, and protecting our IP rights over the products, services, content, and technology we use in our business activities. By the end of FY2022, the Group had registered 44 trademarks in various countries. We also entered into licensing agreements with our customers and business partners to further safeguard our brands.

As part of the Group’s expansion strategy, we acquired full IP rights for the prestigious Golden Bull Award in FY2022. This acquisition adds to the Company’s existing award program IP portfolio, which includes the well-known HR Asia Awards and SME100. The acquisition, which granted us full ownership of a highly coveted and established business award in the region, led to a greater control over our revenue, as we will now be able to license the award to business partners operating in other markets.

Throughout the reporting period, there were no reported cases of IP infringement involving the Group, nor any instances of non-compliance with IP-related laws and regulations. To minimise the risk of IP theft or IP infringement, the Group will periodically review and reinforce existing policies and procedures pertaining to the acquisition, management, and utilisation of our IP assets.

# Improvements in Digitising Publications

The improvements we have made in digitising our publications over the past few years are summarised in the following table:

|Publications|2020|2021|2022|
|---|---|---|---|
|SME Magazine|Print|Digitised|Digitised|
|HR Asia|Print|Digitised|Digitised|
|Golden Bull Award Winner Book|Print|Print|Digitised|
|SME100 Awards Winner Book|Print|Print|Digitised|
|Malaysia Best Employers Book|Print|Print|Digitised|
|Capital Asia|Print|Print|Print|

On top of managing several business media brands, AAL is also involved in organising large-scale exhibitions, business events and conferences for our clients. As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce the negative environmental impact of such events, we are actively directing our clients towards sustainable event management practices by offering them eco-friendly, digital alternatives to the standard hard-copy event collaterals.

As the Group continues to make steady progress in our digitalisation journey, we aim to further reduce our paper consumption in the years to come.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The Board of Directors (the “Board” or “Directors”) of Audience Analytics Limited (the “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”) is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance within the Group. The Board recognises the importance of practising good corporate governance as a fundamental part of its responsibilities to look after and enhance shareholders’ values and the financial performance of the Group.

This report describes the Company’s corporate governance practices with specific reference to the principles and provisions as set out in the Code of Corporate Governance dated 6 August 2018 (the “Code 2018”) and the accompanying Practice Guidance issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore dated 11 January 2023. Pursuant to Rule 710 of the Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”) of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”), the Company confirms that for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (“FY2022”), it has complied with the principles of the Code 2018 and in respect of any deviation from any provision of the Code 2018, it has explicitly stated the provision from which it has varied, explained the reason for variation, and explained how the practices it had adopted are consistent with the intent of the relevant principle of the Code 2018.

# Provision 1.1 – Principal Duties of the Board (cont’d)

The Company has in place a Code of Conduct and Ethics in relation to avoiding conflicts of interest, maintaining the confidentiality of information, compliance with laws, rules and regulations and reporting of violation of laws and company policy. Pursuant to the conflicts of interest policy, each Director is required to promptly disclose any conflict or potential conflict of interest, whether direct or indirect, in relation to a transaction or proposed transaction with the Group as soon as practicable. On an annual basis, each Director is also required to submit details of his/her associates for the purpose of monitoring interested person transactions.

Nonetheless, he/she shall abstain from voting in relation to the conflict-related matters.

When a Director has multiple board representations, the NC will consider whether or not the Director is able to and has adequately carried out his/her duties as a Director of the Company, taking into consideration the Director’s number of listed company board representations and other principal commitments. In support of their candidature for directorship or re-election, Directors are to provide the NC with details of their other commitments and an indication of their time involved.

# Provision 1.6 – Complete, Adequate and Timely Information

The Directors have unrestricted access to the Company’s records and information, minutes of the Board and Board Committee meetings, and management accounts so as to enable them to make informed decisions and carry out their duties. Directors may also liaise with senior executives and other employees to seek additional information if required.

Detailed Board papers and agenda with the relevant background or explanatory information relating to the business of the meeting and information on major operational, financial and corporate issues, are circulated to the Directors before meetings so that all Directors can better understand the issues beforehand, allowing more time at such meetings for questions that the Directors may have. Such Board papers generally include budgets, forecasts, and periodic management accounts. In respect of budgets, any material variances between the projections and actual results are disclosed and explained to the Board. Directors are also informed on a regular basis as and when there are any significant developments or events relating to the Group’s business operations.

# Provision 1.7 – Independent Access to Management, Company Secretary and External Advisers

The Directors have separate and independent access to the Management at all times. Queries by individual Directors on the Company’s developments, management proposals or circulated papers are directed and answered by the Management. The Company Secretary attends and prepares minutes of meetings of the Board and the Board Committees, which are circulated for review.

The Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for advising on the implementation of the Group’s compliance requirements pursuant to the Companies Act, Securities and Futures Act 2001 and all other regulations of the SGX-ST. All Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretary. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is subject to approval of the Board as a whole.

The Board also has independent access to the external advisers, including the Sponsor, and the internal auditors. Should Directors, whether as a group or individually, require independent professional advice in furtherance of their duties, the Company, upon the directive by the Board, shall appoint such independent professional adviser to render advice. The costs of such professional advice shall be borne by the Company.

# Board Composition and Guidance

Principle 2: The board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.

# Board Diversity Policy

The Company recognises and embraces the benefits of diversity on the Board and views Board Diversity as an essential element in supporting the attainment of its strategic objectives and its sustainable development. It also promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, mitigates groupthink and enhances the Board’s overall decision-making capability.

# AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED | Annual Report 2022

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Board Diversity Policy (cont’d)

The Company has adopted a Board Diversity Policy which sets out its approach to achieve diversity of the Board. Pursuant to the Board Diversity Policy, the NC will review the structure, size and composition (including but not limited to the gender, age, education background, professional experiences, skills and knowledge) of the Board at least annually and assist the Board in reviewing the required mix of skills, knowledge, experience and other qualities which the Directors should bring to the Board on an annual basis.

Under the Board Diversity Policy, the Board sets the following diversity objectives, including to have (i) gender diversity with at least 30% female representation on the Board; (ii) age diversity by having members of the Board from different age groups; (iii) balance of skills appropriate for the requirements of the business of the Group; and (iv) appropriate level of independence of the Board. All appointments will be based on merit of candidates, in the context of the skills and having due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, our needs and our core values.

# The current Board composition reflects the Company’s commitment to Board diversity as follows:

|GENDER FOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS|AGE GROUPS FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS|INDEPENDENCE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS|
|---|---|---|
|Female|40 - 49|No of directors|
|Male|50 - 59|Independent Directors|
| |60 and above|Executive Directors|
|3| |0|
|2| |2|
|1| |4|
|0| | |

Accordingly, the NC and the Board are of the view that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional qualifications, age and gender on the Board to serve the needs and plans of the Company, and is satisfied that the objectives of the Board Diversity Policy have been met.

Under Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules, it stipulates that a Director will not be considered as independent under any of the following circumstances:

- if he/she is employed by the Company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three (3) financial years;
- if he/she has an immediate family member who is or has been in any of the past three (3) financial years, employed by the Company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the RC of the Company; or
- if he/she has been a director for an aggregate period of more than nine (9) years (whether before or after listing). He/she may continue to be considered independent until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting (“AGM”) of the Company.

In this regard, each of the Independent Directors have confirmed that he/she and his/her respective associates do not have any employment relationships with the Company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three (3) financial years. At present, none of the Independent Directors have served the Company for more than nine (9) years from his/her date of first appointment to the Board.

The NC has reviewed and determined that Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin, Datuk Alexandra Chin and Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew are independent in character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Independent Directors’ judgement. Each member of the NC will not be involved in the assessment or determination of his/her own independence.

# Provisions 2.2 and 2.3 – Proportion of Independent and Non-Executive Directors

Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is the Company’s Executive Chairman and Managing Director. As at the date of this report, the Board comprises five (5) Directors, three (3) of whom are Independent and Non-Executive Directors. Accordingly, the Company complies with the relevant provisions of the Code 2018 which requires (i) independent directors to make up a majority of the Board where the Chairman of the Board is not independent, and (ii) non-executive directors to make up a majority of the Board.

# Provision 2.4 – Board Composition and Competency of the Board

# Provision 2.1 – Board Independence

The NC reviews the independence of the Directors annually. The NC considers the guidelines set out in the Code 2018, the Practice Guidance and Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules in determining whether a Director is independent.

Under Provision 2.1 of the Code 2018, an independent director is one who is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgement in view of the best interests of the Company.

Each Independent Director is required to complete a form to confirm his/her independence upon appointment and subsequently on an annual basis. The Independent Directors have confirmed that, in accordance with the Code 2018, they do not have any relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Directors’ independent business judgment in view of the best interests of the Company.

# AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED | Annual Report 2022

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 2.4 – Board Composition and Competency of the Board (cont’d)

The Board’s composition, size, balance and independence of each Independent Director are reviewed by the NC annually. The Board considers its present size and composition appropriate, taking into account the nature and scope of the Group’s operations, and the skills and knowledge of the Directors.

The Directors have the right competencies and diversity of experience to enable them to engage in constructive debate and contribute effectively. All Board members bring their independent judgment, diversified knowledge and experience to bear on issues of strategy (including social and environmental issues), performance, resources and standards of conduct and ethics. Core competencies include accounting, legal, finance, business acumen, familiarity with regulatory and compliance requirements and knowledge of risk management. The Board members also collectively possess the necessary core competencies for an effective functioning of the Board.

The NC is of the view that the current Board comprises persons whose diverse skills, experience and attributes provide for an effective Board. The Board will take into consideration the skill sets and experience including gender diversity for any future Board appointments.

# Provision 2.5 – Meetings of Non-Executive and Independent Directors without Management

As the Chairman and Managing Director, Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is responsible for:

1. leading the Board to ensure its effectiveness;
2. the business strategy and direction of the Group, implementation of the Group’s corporate plans and policies, and executive decision-making;
3. ensuring that the Board meetings are held when necessary;
4. scheduling and preparing agendas and ensuring adequate time for discussion;
5. promoting openness and discussion during Board meetings;
6. exercising control over the information flow between the Board and the Management by ensuring that the Board receives complete, adequate and timely information;
7. ensuring effective communication with the shareholders and other stakeholders;
8. encouraging constructive relations within the Board and the Management;
9. facilitating effective contributions of the Non-Executive Directors; and
10. promoting high standards of corporate governance.

Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is assisted by the Company Secretary at all the Board meetings. Where necessary, the auditors of the Company and other external consultants are invited to attend the Board meetings to assist the Directors in their deliberations.

Although all the Directors have an equal responsibility for the Group’s operations, the role of the Independent Directors is particularly important in ensuring that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors and the Management are constructively challenged, fully discussed and examined.

As the Independent Directors make up a majority of the Board, the objectivity of such deliberations is assured. The Independent Directors constructively challenge and assist to develop both the Group’s short-term and long-term business strategies. The Management’s progress in implementing such agreed business strategies is monitored by the Independent Directors.

The Independent Directors would meet regularly, at least annually, without the presence of Management (including the Executive Directors), and this has been carried out in FY2022.

# Provision 3.3 – Lead Independent Director

As recommended by the Code 2018, the Board has appointed Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin as the Lead Independent Director of the Company, to provide leadership in circumstances where the Chairman is conflicted. Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin is available to shareholders should they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of communication with the Chairman and Managing Director or the Financial Controller are inappropriate or inadequate.

Led by the Lead Independent Director, the Independent Directors will meet, where necessary, without the presence of the other Directors, and the Lead Independent Director will provide feedback to the Chairman and Managing Director and the Financial Controller after such meetings, as deemed appropriate.

# Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

# Board Membership

Principle 3: There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

Principle 4: The board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the board.

# Provision 3.1 – Separation of Role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is currently the Chairman and Managing Director of the Company. The Company does not have a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”).

Taking into account the current corporate structure, size, nature and scope of the Group’s operation, the Board is of the view that it is presently not necessary to separate the roles of the Chairman and Managing Director. With the AC and the RC consisting of all Non-Executive and Independent Directors, and the NC consisting majority of Non-Executive and Independent Directors, the Board believes that there are sufficient safeguards and checks to ensure that the process of decision-making by the Board is independent and based on collective decisions without any individual or group of individuals exercising any considerable concentration of power or influence.

# Provisions 4.1 and 4.2 – NC Composition, Role and Responsibilities

The NC comprises three (3) Directors, of which two (2) out of three (3) Directors are Independent Directors. The Lead Independent Director is also a member of the NC. The NC shall meet at least once a year. The members of the NC are as follows:

|Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew|(Chairman)|(Independent Director)|
|---|---|---|
|Datuk William Ng Yan Meng|(Member)|(Chairman and Managing Director)|
|Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin|(Member)|(Lead Independent Director)|

# AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED | Annual Report 2022

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provisions 4.1 and 4.2 – NC Composition, Role and Responsibilities (cont’d)

The NC is responsible for:

- deciding how the performance of the Board, its Board Committees and Directors may be evaluated and proposing objective performance criteria;
- regularly reviewing the Board structure, size and composition and making recommendations to the Board with regards to any adjustments that are deemed necessary;
- reviewing the succession plans for Directors, in particular the appointment and/or replacement of the Chairman and Managing Director and key management personnel of the Company;
- identifying suitable candidates, reviewing and recommending all nominations on appointments and re-appointments of Directors, having regard to the Director’s contribution and performance including making recommendations on the composition of the Board and the balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors appointed to the Board;
- determining on an annual basis whether or not a Director is independent under the definitions set out in the Code 2018 and the Catalist Rules;
- reviewing induction programs for new Directors, as well as the training and professional development programs for the continuing training of the Directors;
- deciding whether a Director, who has multiple board representations, is able to and has adequately carried out his/her duties as a director.

# Provision 4.3 – Selection, Appointment and Re-appointment of Directors

also provides that a newly appointed Director must submit himself/herself for re-election at the forthcoming AGM following his/her appointment.

Accordingly, (i) pursuant to Regulation 100 of the Constitution of the Company, Datuk Alexandra Chin and Ms Elaine Beh-Pur Lin are due for retirement by rotation at the forthcoming AGM. All of the retiring Directors have each consented to remain in office.

Datuk Alexandra Chin shall, upon re-election as Director of the Company, remain as an Independent Director, the Chairman of the AC, and a member of the RC.

Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin shall, upon re-election as Director of the Company, remain as the Lead Independent Director, the Chairman of the RC, and a member of each of the AC and the NC.

The NC has recommended to the Board, and the Board has accepted the re-election of Datuk Alexandra Chin and Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin as the Directors of the Company at the forthcoming AGM.

In making the above recommendations, the NC had considered the said Directors’ overall contribution and performance. Each member of the NC has abstained from voting on any resolutions in respect of his/her re-nomination as a Director of the Company.

The Board, through the delegation of its authority to the NC, has used its best efforts to ensure that Directors appointed to the Board possess the skills, experience and knowledge, business, finance and management skills necessary for the Group’s businesses and each Director, through his/her contributions, brings to the Board an independent (when applicable) and objective perspective to enable balanced and well-considered decisions to be made.

The NC is responsible for identifying candidates and reviewing all nominations for the appointments of new directors. When an existing director chooses to retire or the need for a new director arises, either to replace a retiring director or to enhance the Board’s strength, the NC, in consultation with the Board, evaluates and determines the selection criteria so as to identify candidates with the appropriate expertise and experience for the appointment as new director. The selection criterion includes integrity, diversity of competencies, expertise, industry experience and financial literacy. The NC seeks potential candidates widely and beyond the Directors/Management recommendations and is empowered to engage external parties, such as professional search firms and institutions, to undertake research on or assessment of candidates as it deems necessary. The NC then meets with the shortlisted potential candidates with the appropriate profile to assess suitability and to ensure that the candidates are aware of the expectation and the level of commitment required, before nominating the most suitable candidate to the Board for approval and appointment as director.

Please refer to the Notice of AGM for the resolutions put forth on the Directors’ proposed re-election and re-appointment, as well as the detailed information on each Director as set out in the section entitled “Information on Directors Nominated for Re-election – Appendix 7F of the Catalist Rules” of this report.

# Provision 4.4 – Continuous Review of Directors’ Independence

The NC determines annually, and as and when circumstances require, whether a Director is independent, taking into consideration the disclosures by the Directors of any relationships with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, and the confirmation of independence form completed by each Independent Director to confirm his/her independence. Such form is drawn up based on Principle 2 of the Code 2018, as well as Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules.

The NC has assessed the independence of the Directors and is satisfied that there are no relationships, which would deem any of the Independent Directors not to be independent. Each of the Independent Directors also confirmed that there are no other relationships (including any immediate family relationships) between him/her, and the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers.

The role of the NC also includes the responsibility of reviewing the re-nomination of Directors who retire by rotation, taking into consideration the Director’s availability and responsiveness to ad-hoc queries and the quality of the responses received, the value that each Director brings to the Board, and whether his/her respective expertise and skillsets would result in a balanced Board with the range of experiences that would add value to the Company.

The Board, with the concurrence of the NC, has also considered Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin, Datuk Alexandra Chin and Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew to be independent for the purpose of Rule 704(7) of the Catalist Rules.

# Provision 4.5 – Multiple Listed Company Directorships and Other Principal Commitments

Apart from guidance under the Code 2018 and regulations under the Constitution, the NC also takes into consideration the individual contributions of each Director based on his/her respective areas of competence. These assessments are undertaken periodically both at formal meetings and in other discussions outside formal meetings.

During FY2022, the Company does not have any alternate directors. The Code 2018 and the Practice Guidance requires listed companies to fix the maximum number of board representations on other listed companies that their directors may hold and to disclose this in their annual report. The Board, with the concurrence of the NC, has agreed that the Directors shall not hold more than four (4) directorships in listed companies if they hold a full-time position or six (6) directorships in listed companies if they do not hold a full-time position. The number of external directorships in other listed companies outside of the Group concurrently held by the Executive Directors shall be limited to two (2). None of the Directors currently hold more directorships than this limit.

# Board Performance

Provisions 5.1 and 5.2 – Board Evaluation Policy and Board Performance Criteria (cont’d)

Principle 5: The board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

The NC also has an annual performance evaluation exercise for each of the Board Committees. The performance evaluations of the AC, NC and RC are similarly carried out with questionnaires. The results are collated and the findings are analysed and discussed by the NC, with comparatives from the previous year’s results, and reported to the Board.

The NC is responsible for deciding how the Board’s performance may be evaluated and proposing objective performance criteria for the Board’s approval and implementing corporate governance measures to achieve good stewardship of the Company. The NC has adopted processes for the evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the Board Committees and individual Directors, based on the performance criteria approved by the Board. The objective of the annual evaluation is to identify areas for improvement and thereafter implement appropriate action.

The assessment of the contribution by each Director is specifically related to the individual Director’s duties such as preparedness, contribution and industry and business knowledge and experience which are crucial to the Group’s business. The NC evaluates each Director’s performance based on the following review parameters, including:

- board composition;
- attendance at Board/Board Committee meetings;
- participation and contribution at Board/ Board Committee meetings;
- availability for consultation and advice, when required;
- independence of the Directors (where applicable); and
- appropriate skill, experience and expertise.

Individual Director evaluations are also conducted whereby each Director is evaluated on his/her contributions through proper guidance, diligent oversight and able leadership, and the support extended to Management in steering the Group.

The results of the Board, Board Committees and Individual Director evaluations are compiled by the Company Secretary and reported to the NC. In discussing the results of the performance evaluations for FY2022, the Board and Board Committee members were able to identify areas for improving their effectiveness. No significant problems were identified.

Following the review in FY2022, the Board is of the view that the Board and its Board Committees operate effectively and that each Director contributes to the overall effectiveness of the Board and its Board Committees. There was no external consultant involved in the Board evaluation process for FY2022.

The NC will continue to review the formal assessment processes for evaluating Board performance, its Board Committees, as well as the contribution of individual Directors to the effectiveness of the Board. Each member of the NC shall abstain from voting on any resolutions in respect of his/her re-nomination and assessment as a Director.

Although the Board performance evaluation does not include a benchmark index of its industry peers and its share performance, the Board performance assessment is undertaken collectively and informally on a continual basis by the NC with input from the other Board members. The NC also takes into account the Board’s balance and mix in evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the Board as a whole. Factors taken into consideration for the assessment of the Board as a whole includes the contribution to the development of strategies and effective risk management, response to problems and crisis, and the evaluation that underpins the Board’s effectiveness in providing timely information. The assessment of the contribution of the Chairman encompasses effective leadership and communication with shareholders and the Board.

# REMUNERATION MATTERS

Principle 6: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies

The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors and key management personnel. No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

# Provisions 6.1 and 6.2 – RC Composition, Role and Responsibilities

The NC has in place an annual Board Performance Evaluation exercise, which is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and facilitate discussion to enable Directors to discharge their duties more effectively. The evaluations are carried out by means of a questionnaire being completed by each Director. The results of the completed questionnaires are collated and the findings are analysed and discussed by the NC, with comparatives from the previous year’s results and reported to the Board.

The Board performance evaluation exercise provides an opportunity to obtain constructive feedback from each Director on whether the Board’s procedures and processes had allowed him/her to discharge his/her duties effectively. Directors are encouraged to propose changes to enhance effectiveness as a whole.

The Board evaluation questionnaire takes into consideration qualitative factors such as Board composition, information flow to the Board, Board process, Board accountability, matters concerning the Managing Director and top management and standards of conduct of Board members. The NC would review the need to set quantitative targets as performance criteria when appropriate.

The performance criteria will not be changed from year to year unless circumstances deem it necessary for any of the criteria to be changed, for example to align with changes to the Code 2018 and the onus should be on the Board to justify the decision.

The Company has established the RC for determining the remuneration of Directors and key management personnel of the Company. The RC shall meet at least once a year. The RC comprises three (3) members, all of whom are Independent and Non-Executive Directors, as set out below:

|Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin|(Chairman)|(Lead Independent Director)|
|---|---|---|

- to consider the disclosure requirements for Directors’ and key management personnel’s remuneration as required by the SGX-ST and as recommended by the Code 2018, as the case may be.

# Provision 6.3 – Fair Remuneration

The RC ensures that a formal and transparent procedure is in place for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors and key management personnel. The recommendations of the RC are submitted to the Board for endorsement.

All aspects of remuneration, including but not limited to, Directors’ fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options and benefits-in-kind are reviewed by the RC. No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration. Each member of the RC shall abstain from voting on any resolution in respect of his/her remuneration package and making any recommendations and/or participating in any deliberations of the RC in respect of his/her remuneration package.

The Company’s obligations arising in the event of termination of service contracts of its Executive Directors and key management personnel are contained in their respective employment letters. The RC is satisfied that such contracts of service provide for fair and reasonable termination clauses, applicable to the respective employment class and are not overly generous.

# Provision 6.4 – Remuneration Consultant

The RC has the right to seek professional advice relating to the remuneration of all Directors and key management personnel. The RC would ensure that any relationship between the appointed remuneration consultant and any of the Directors and key management personnel will not affect the independence and objectivity of the remuneration consultant. The expenses of such advice shall be borne by the Company.

For FY2022, no remuneration consultant was engaged by the Board.

# Level and Mix of Remuneration

# Principle 7:

The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and key management personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the Company.

# Provision 7.1 – Remuneration of Executive Directors and Key Management Personnel

For further information on the remuneration of Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung, please refer to the section entitled “Directors, Executive Officer and Staff - Service Agreements” of the offer document dated 14 September 2021 (the “Offer Document”) for the Listing.

In setting remuneration packages, the RC ensures that the Executive Directors and key management personnel are adequately but not excessively remunerated as compared to the industry and other comparable companies. The remuneration packages comprise a basic salary component and a variable component, which is a discretionary bonus, based on the performance of the Group as a whole and their individual performance. There are no pre-determined performance conditions for the discretionary bonus. The discretionary bonus for the Executive Directors and key management personnel is recommended by the RC on an annual basis and subject to approval by the Board, which is based on quantitative criteria (including revenue, profit after tax and relative financial performance of the Group to its peers).

The Company has adopted a performance share plan known as the “Shared Purpose and Prosperity Incentive Plan” (“SPRINT”) and a share option scheme known as the “Group Employee Share Option Scheme” (“Group ESOS”). Both the SPRINT and the Group ESOS provide eligible participants with an opportunity to participate in the equity of the Company, to motivate them towards better performance through increased dedication and loyalty, to ensure alignment of interests with those of shareholders, and to promote the long-term success of the Group. Both the SPRINT and the Group ESOS form an integral and important component of the compensation plan and are designed primarily to reward and retain employees whose services are vital to the growth and performance of the Company and the Group. As at the date of this report, no awards and options have been granted under the SPRINT and the Group ESOS respectively.

During FY2022, except for the SPRINT and the Group ESOS, the Company does not have any material long-term incentive benefits involving the grant of awards or options or any other form of deferred remuneration, which needs to be accrued.

The Company does not currently use contractual provisions to allow the Company to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from the Executive Directors and key management personnel in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial results, or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Company.

The Executive Directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Company, and hence, the Company should be able to avail itself of remedies against the Executive Directors in the event of such breach of fiduciary duties. Similarly, for the key management personnel, the Company believes that there are alternative legal avenues to specific contractual provisions that will enable the Company to recover financial losses arising from exceptional circumstances above from the key management personnel.

The remuneration policy of the Group is to provide compensation packages at market rates that reward successful performance and attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors and key management personnel.

The Group’s remuneration policy comprises a fixed component and a variable component. The fixed component is in the form of fixed monthly salary or allowance whereas the variable component is linked to the performance of the Group and individual. The variable component is designed to align the interests of such Executive Directors and key management personnel with those of the shareholders.

# Provision 7.2 – Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors

Independent and Non-Executive Directors are paid annually and such fees, being an agreed amount, are subject to shareholders’ approval at the AGM. The proposed Directors’ fees are determined in accordance with their contributions, taking into account factors such as effort, time spent and responsibilities of the Directors. The Non-Executive Directors shall not be over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised.

The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and key management personnel are based on service contracts. Datuk William Ng Yan Meng, the Chairman and Managing Director of the Company, and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung, Executive Director, each have a service agreement with the Company for an initial period of three (3) years with effect from 30 September 2021.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 7.3 – Attract, Retain and Motivate Directors and Key Management Personnel

# Provision 8.1(a) – Directors’ Remuneration (cont’d)

As described above, the Group maintains a framework of remuneration for the Board and key management personnel to ensure fair and competitive remuneration packages.

# Disclosure on Remuneration

Principle 8: The company is transparent on its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation.

The RC has reviewed and approved the remuneration packages of the Directors and key management personnel having due regard to their contributions as well as the financial capabilities of the Company. The Directors and key management personnel are paid based on a fixed schedule of fees and remuneration (including base salary, fixed allowances and benefits, and bonus) respectively.

During FY2022, there were no termination, retirement and post-employment benefits granted to the Directors or the key management personnel.

Details on the remuneration of Directors and key management personnel for FY2022 are reported below.

# Provision 8.1(a) – Directors’ Remuneration

The RC has recommended that the Independent Directors to be paid Directors’ fee of S$54,000 for the FY2022, and Directors’ fee of S$54,000 for the financial year ending 31 December 2023 (“FY2023”), which are to be paid half yearly in arrears. The aforementioned Directors’ fees will be tabled at the forthcoming AGM for approval by the Company’s shareholders.

# Provision 8.1(b) – Remuneration of Key Management Personnel

In FY2022, the Company has only one (1) key management personnel (who is not a Director), being the Financial Controller of the Company. The band and aggregate remuneration paid to him is not disclosed in this report.

The Board believes that disclosure of the remuneration of the key management personnel as recommended by the Code 2018 would be disadvantageous to the business interest of the Company, in view of the sensitive nature of such information and high competition for talent.

# Provision 8.2 – Remuneration of Substantial Shareholders or Immediate Family Members of a Director, the Managing Director or Substantial Shareholders

Save for Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung who are substantial shareholders of the Company, during FY2022, there was no employee of the Group who is a substantial shareholder of the Company, or an immediate family member of any Director, the Managing Director or a substantial shareholder of the Company, and whose remuneration exceeds S$100,000 during the year.

The Company has disclosed the remuneration of the Directors in bands of S$250,000 which would provide a good overview and is informative of the remuneration of each Director. The Company is of the view that due to confidentiality and sensitivity attached to remuneration matters, it would not be in the best interests of the Company to disclose the exact details of the remuneration of the Directors.

# Provision 8.3 – Employee Share Schemes and Executive Performance Conditions

Other than the SPRINT and the Group ESOS, the Company does not have any employee share scheme nor any long-term incentive scheme.

# SPRINT

Under SPRINT, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards granted under the scheme on any date, when added to (i) the number of shares issued and issuable and/or transferred and transferable in respect of all awards granted under the scheme; and (ii) all shares issued and issuable and/or transferred and transferable in respect of all options granted or awards granted under any other share incentive schemes or share plans adopted by the Company for the time being in force, shall not exceed fifteen per cent (15%) of the issued and paid-up share capital (excluding treasury shares) of the Company on the day preceding that date.

Group employees who have attained the age of twenty-one (21) years and hold such rank as may be designated by the RC from time to time and who have been in full-time employment of the Group for a period of at least twelve (12) months (or in the case of Executive Directors, such shorter period as the RC may determine), and Non-Executive Directors (including the Independent Directors) of the Group who have attained the age of twenty-one (21) years and are not undischarged bankrupts and have not entered into a composition with their respective creditors, shall be eligible to participate in SPRINT.

Controlling shareholders of the Company or associates of such controlling shareholders are eligible to participate in SPRINT if their participation and awards are approved by independent shareholders in separate resolutions for each such person and for each such award.

The number of shares which are the subject of each award to be granted to a participant in accordance with SPRINT shall be determined at the absolute discretion of the RC, which shall take into account criteria as it considers fit, such as (but not limited to) his rank, job performance, years of service, potential for future development, his contribution to the success and development of the Company.

The Group ESOS shall be administered by the RC in its absolute discretion and with such powers or duties as conferred on it by the Board. The aggregate number of shares comprised in any option to be offered to a grantee shall be determined at the absolute discretion of the RC, which shall take into account criteria such as rank, past performance, years of service, contribution to the success and development of the Group, and potential development of that grantee.

Under the rules of the Group ESOS, there are no fixed periods for the grant of options. As such, offers of the grant of options may be made at any time from time to time at the discretion of the RC. However, no option shall be granted during the period of thirty (30) days immediately preceding the date of announcement of the Company’s interim or final results (as the case may be). In addition, in the event that an announcement on any matter of an exceptional nature involving unpublished price and/ or trade sensitive information is imminent, offers may only be made on or after the third market day from the date on which the aforesaid announcement is released.

# ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

# Risk Management and Internal Control Systems

Principle 9: The board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

# Provision 9.1 – Risk Management and Internal Control Systems

The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk. The Management is responsible to the Board for the design, implementation and monitoring of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and to provide the Board with the basis to determine the Company’s levels of risk tolerance and risk policies.

The Company has clear policies and guidelines from dealings in securities by Directors and employees. The Company imposes a trading embargo on its Directors and employees from trading in its securities for the period of one (1) month before the announcement of its half-yearly and full-year financial results.

The Board notes that all internal control systems contain inherent limitations and no sound system of internal controls could provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgment in decision making, human error losses, fraud or other irregularities. However, alternative procedures, policies, guidelines and compliance regulations are in place to mitigate any possible and/or suspected irregularities.

To date, nothing has come to the attention of the AC and/or Board of any deficiency and/or dysfunction of the internal control implementation that has resulted in any significant loss and/or material financial misstatement.

# Risk Committee

As the Company does not have a separate risk management committee, the AC and the Management assume the responsibility of the risk management function. The AC and Management review the Company’s business and operational activities regularly to identify areas of significant risks as well as appropriate measures to control and mitigate these risks. The AC and Management review and highlight all significant matters in relation to risk management and framework to the Board. Having considered the Company’s business and operations as well as its existing internal control and risk management systems, the Board is of the view that a separate risk management committee is not required for the time being.

# Provision 9.2 – Board’s Comments on Adequacy and Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control Systems

For FY2022, the Board had received assurance from the Chairman and Managing Director, and the Financial Controller that the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Company’s operations and finances, and the Company’s risk management and internal control systems were adequate and effective to address financial, operational, information technology and compliance risks.

In FY2022, the Group’s external auditors (to the extent as required by them to form an audit opinion on the statutory financial statements) and internal auditors conducted a review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system and risk management system. Findings and recommendations for improvement were reported to the AC.

The AC also enquires and relies on reviews by the Management and the reports from the internal auditors and the external auditors on any material non-compliance and internal control weaknesses. The AC oversees and monitors the implementation of any improvements thereto.

# AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED | Annual Report 2022

# Provision 9.2 – Board’s Comments on Adequacy and Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control Systems (cont’d)

The AC is of the view that the works carried out by the Management, the internal auditors and the external auditors are adequate.

Based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by the internal and external auditors, the assurance received from the Managing Director and Financial Controller, and reviews performed by the Management, the AC and the Board are of the opinion that the Group’s internal controls, addressing financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks, and its risk management systems were adequate and effective in FY2022 to address the risks the Group considers material to its business operations.

The AC and the Board will continue to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and risk management system on an on-going basis.

# Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

# Opinion

In performing its functions, the Audit Committee met with the Company’s external and internal auditors to discuss the respective scopes of their work, the results of their examination and evaluation of the Company’s internal accounting control system.

The Audit Committee also reviewed the following:

- a) The audit plans, scope of work, evaluation of the adequacy of the internal controls, audit reports, management letters on internal controls and management response;
- b) The adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls addressing financial, operational and compliance risks prior to the incorporation of such results in the annual report;
- c) The financial statements of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group before their submission to the directors of the Company and external auditors’ report on those financial statements;
- d) The half-yearly (where relevant) and annual announcements as well as the related press releases on the results and financial position of the Company and the Group;

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Audience Analytics Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as set out on pages 97 to 138, which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2022, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group and the statement of changes in equity of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2022 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and of the changes in equity of the Company for the financial year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

- e) The co-operation and assistance given by the management to the Group’s external auditor;
- f) Interested person transactions falling within the scope of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual, Section B: Rules of Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited and other relevant statutory requirements and any potential conflicts of interests;
- g) The re-appointment of the external and internal auditors of the Group.

The Audit Committee has full access to and has the co-operation of the management and has been given the resources required for it to discharge its function properly. It also has full discretion to invite any director and executive officer to attend its meetings. The external and internal auditors have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.

# Independent auditor

The independent auditor, Baker Tilly TFW LLP, has expressed its willingness to accept re-appointment.

# Revenue recognition

Refer to Notes 2(b) and 3 to the financial statements.

Description of key audit matter:

The Group recognised revenue of $14,133,791 during the financial year. Revenue is one of the key elements in the financial statements used as a measure of financial performance of an entity and the revenue recognition accounting policies adopted by the Group vary depending on the nature of the respective revenue stream and the contractual terms with the customers.

Revenue recognition is considered a key audit matter due to the significance of revenue from business impact assessment and recognition segment to the financial statements which accounted for $13,342,390 of the Group’s revenue of $14,133,791 and the time and audit effort required to review management’s tracking on the delivery of performance obligations under the varying contractual terms with customers in determining the timing of the revenue to be recognised.

# Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d)

# Key Audit Matters (cont’d)

# Revenue recognition (cont’d)

The procedures performed by us and the component auditors to address the key audit matter:

We obtained an understanding of the Group’s accounting policies on revenue recognition and evaluated appropriateness of those revenue recognition policies. We assessed and tested the design and implementation of key relevant internal controls over revenue recognition processes. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

We agreed samples of sale invoices issued to details of contractual terms signed with customers, checked the delivery of performance obligations to relevant supporting sources and documents and calculations of corresponding contract liability and revenue recognised in the Group’s financial records.

We also assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures made in the financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
- In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont’d)

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporation incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Sek See Mun.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the financial year ended 31 December 2022

# 1 Corporate information

Audience Analytics Pte. Ltd. (the “Company”) (Co. Reg. No. 202113626W) was incorporated in Singapore on 16 April 2021 for the purpose of acquiring the existing companies pursuant to the restructuring exercise on the preparation of the listing of the Company. On 23 July 2021, the Company was converted into a public company limited by shares and changed its name to Audience Analytics Limited.

The registered office and principal place of business of the Company is at 138 Robinson Road, #26-03 Oxley Tower Singapore 068906. The Company is listed on Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) on 30 September 2021.

The principal activity of the Company is that of investment holding. The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements.

The immediate and ultimate holding company is Bain Equity Sdn. Bhd, which is incorporated in Malaysia.

# 2 Summary of significant accounting policies

# a) Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Group are presented in Singapore Dollar (“$”), which is the Company’s functional currency. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial years. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions and historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.

Use of estimates and judgements

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement in applying accounting policies, or areas where assumptions and estimates have a significant risk of resulting in material adjustment within next financial year are disclosed in Note 2(t) to the financial statements.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables and payables (other than lease liabilities) approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

The accompanying notes form an integral part of the financial statements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the financial year ended 31 December 2022

# 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

# a) Basis of preparation (cont’d)

In the current financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) Interpretations (“SFRS(I) INT”) that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current financial year. Changes to the Group’s accounting policies have been made as required, in accordance with the transitional provisions in the respective SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT.

The adoption of these new/revised SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT did not have any material effect on the financial results or position of the Group and the Company.

# b) Revenue recognition (cont’d)

# Revenue from exhibitions

The Group identifies optimum exhibition dates, secures venues, organises exhibitions for its customers. Revenue is derived from rental of exhibition booths and space to exhibitors. Revenue is recognised over the period of the exhibitions based on the number of days which the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits from the services provided by the Group. The Group bills the customer in accordance with the billing term in the contract. A contract liability is recognised when the Group has not yet performed under the contract but bills customers in advance or receives advanced payments from the customer. A receivable is recognised when the Group has a present right to payment in accordance with the contractual terms with customers. Customers are required to pay upon signing of contract. No element of financing is deemed present as the expected length of time between when the Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be one year or less.

Costs to fulfil a contract are capitalised if the costs relate directly to the contract, generate or enhance resources used in satisfying the contract and are expected to be recovered. Other contract costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalised contract costs are subsequently charged to profit or loss as cost of sales on a basis consistent with the pattern of recognition of the associated revenue.

The Group conducts business impact assessments on companies nominated for its business recognition awards. The Group generates revenue primarily through “nomination fee” from applicants to participate in the awards and the sale of awards packages to winners. Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation (“PO”) by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. Nomination fee is recognised at the point in time upon the completion of assessment exercise and when the results are announced to the applicants. Revenue from sale of awards packages is recognised at the point in time when the awards ceremonies are held where the items within the packages are delivered to customer with minimal unfulfilled obligations. These remaining unfulfilled obligations will be satisfied in the following year and recognised as revenue upon fulfilments.

The Group uses an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or develop a stand-alone price based on their best estimation of the customer perceived value that reinforces the premium image of their awards and the services when an observable price is not available.

A contract liability is recognised when the Group has not yet performed the services under the contract but bills customers in advance or receives advanced payments from the customer. A receivable is recognised when the Group has a present right to payment in accordance with the contractual terms with customers. Customers are required to pay upon signing of contract.

Costs to fulfil a contract are capitalised if the costs relate directly to the contract, generate or enhance resources used in satisfying the contract and are expected to be recovered. Other contract costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalised contract costs are subsequently charged to profit or loss as cost of sales on a basis consistent with the pattern of recognition of the associated revenue.

# Revenue from business media

The Group organises and manages networking events and forums. The Group generates revenue through the sale of event sponsorship packages. Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation (“PO”) by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. Revenue is recognised at the point in time when the networking events and forums are held where the items within the packages are delivered to customer with no unfulfilled obligation.

In addition, the Group provides advertorial production and advertisement placement services in the Group’s magazines. The Group transfers control and recognises a sale at the point in time when the advertorials and advertisement are published (defined as an issue’s on-sale date). A contract liability is recognised when the Group has not yet performed under the contract but bills customers in advance or receives advanced payments from the customer.

For performance obligations related to sales of magazines, the Group recognises revenue when each magazine issue is mailed or sold to the customer.

A receivable is recognised when the Group has a present right to payment in accordance with the contractual terms with customers. Customers are required to pay upon signing of contract. No element of financing is deemed present as the expected length of time between when the Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be one year or less.

# Interest income

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

# c) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

In the Company’s statement of financial position, investment in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. On disposal of the investment, the difference between disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts of the investments are recognised in profit or loss.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2022

# 2 Summary of significant accounting policies (cont’d)

# d) Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements

The consolidated financial statements comprised the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the reporting date. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.

Intragroup balances and transactions, including income, expenses and dividends, are eliminated in full. Profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are eliminated in full.

# Business combinations involving entities under common control

Business combinations involving entities under common control are accounted for by applying the pooling of interest method.

Under this method, the Company has been treated as the holding company of the subsidiaries for the financial years presented rather than from the completion of the restructuring exercise on the preparation of the listing of the Company on SGX-ST. Accordingly, the results of the Group included the results of the subsidiaries for the entire periods under review. Such manner of presentation reflects the economic substance of the companies, which were under common control throughout the relevant period, as a single economic enterprise, although the legal parent-subsidiary relationships were not established.

Pursuant to this:

- Assets and liabilities are reflected at their existing carrying amounts;
- No adjustments are made to reflect the fair values on the date of combination or recognise any new assets or liabilities;
- No additional goodwill is recognised as a result of the combination;
- Prior to the issue of shares by the Company in connection with the restructuring exercise, the aggregate equity of the subsidiaries held directly by the Company is shown as the Group’s equity for financial years under review; and
- Upon the completion of the restructuring exercise, any difference between the consideration paid by the Company and the equity ‘acquired’ is reflected within the equity of the Group as merger reserve.

# e) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.

The cost of property, plant and equipment initially recognised includes its purchase price and any cost that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Dismantlement, removal or restoration costs are included as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment if the obligation for dismantlement, removal or restoration is incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the asset.

The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised.

# Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the depreciable amounts of the property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|Years|Computers and office equipment|5 to 10|
|---|---|---|
| |Furniture and fittings|5 to 10|
| |Renovation|10|
| |Motor vehicle|5|

The residual values, estimated useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date. The effects of any revision are recognised in profit or loss when the changes arise.

Fully depreciated assets are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use.

# f) Intangible asset

Acquired trademark is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of trademark over 10 years, which is the shorter of its estimated useful life and period of contractual rights.

# g) Impairment of non-financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A previously recognised impairment loss for an asset is only reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

# h) Leases - When a Group entity is the lessee

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter period of the lease term and the useful lives of the assets. If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

# The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|Warehouse|2|
|---|---|
|Furniture and fittings|3|
|Motor vehicles|4 to 5|

The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the statements of financial position.

The Group applies SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in Note 2(g).

# Lease liabilities

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the statements of financial position. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability using the effective interest method, and reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

# Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date, initial direct cost, less any lease incentive received.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. To the extent that the cost relates to a right-of-use asset, the costs are included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.

# i) Income taxes

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively).

Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income for the current year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable or recoverable in respect of previous years. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the reporting date arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, and at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax liability is provided on all temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associated companies, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on currently enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at the reporting date.

Deferred income tax is measured based on the tax consequence that will follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities.

# j) Financial assets

# Recognition and derecognition

Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date - the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

# Impairment

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) for financial assets carried at amortised cost. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.

Financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets (other than financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) are added to the fair value of the financial assets on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Trade receivables without a significant financing component is initially measured at transaction prices.

# Classification and measurement

All financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.

The Group classifies its financial assets at amortised cost. The classification is based on the entity’s business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.

The Group reclassifies financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a “12-month ECL”). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a “lifetime ECL”).

For trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component, the Group applies a simplified approach to recognise a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted as appropriate for current conditions and forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial asset at an amount equal to lifetime ECL in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the conditions for lifetime ECL are no longer met, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at the current reporting date.

# Subsequent measurement

# Debt instruments

Debt instruments include trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments, GST receivables, grant receivable and tax recoverable) and cash and cash equivalents. The subsequent measurement category is depending on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and cash flow characteristics of the asset: The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial assets with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account.

# Offset

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented on the statements of financial position when, and only when the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

# Amortised cost

The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:

- The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in interest income using the EIR method.

# k) Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with financial institutions which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.

# l) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities include trade and other payables and lease liabilities. Financial liabilities are recognised on the statements of financial position when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instruments. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is extinguished. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised and through the amortisation process.

# m) Share capital

Ordinary shares

Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital.

# p) Foreign currencies (cont’d)

Translation of Group entities’ financial statements

The results and financial position of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the Group’s presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

# n) Provisions for other liabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle that obligation and the amount can be estimated reliably. Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the obligation.

When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as a finance cost in profit or loss.

# o) Employee benefits

Defined contribution plans

Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into separate entities and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions once the contributions have been paid. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.

1. Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rates at the date of the statements of financial position;
2. Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless the average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions); and
3. All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the currency translation reserve within equity.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

On disposal of a foreign group entity, the cumulative amount of the currency translation reserve relating to that particular foreign entity is reclassified from equity and recognised in profit or loss when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.

# Employee leave entitlements

Employee entitlements to annual leave and long service leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave and long service leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date.

# p) Foreign currencies

Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the “functional currency”). The financial statements of the Group are presented in Singapore Dollar, which is the Company’s functional currency.

Interim dividends are recorded during the financial year in which they are declared payable.

Final dividends are recorded in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

# r) Government grants

Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is recognised as deferred capital grant on the statement of financial position and is amortised to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalments.

# Transactions and balances

Transactions in a currency other than the functional currency (“foreign currency”) are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Currency translation gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss, except for currency translation differences on net investment in foreign operations and borrowings and other currency instruments qualifying as net investment hedges for foreign operations, which are included in the currency transaction reserve within equity in the financial statements. The currency translation reserve is reclassified from equity to profit or loss of the Group on disposal of the foreign operation.

When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised in profit or loss over the period necessary to match them on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.

# s) Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incurs expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with other components of the Group. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group’s chief operating decision maker for making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

Non-monetary items measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined.

t) Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

Income taxes

The amount and timing of taxable income and deductibility of certain expenditure is subject to the interpretation of complex tax regulations. Accordingly, there are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. As at 31 December 2022, the carrying amounts of the Group’s income tax payables and deferred tax assets were $1,063,328 (2021: $632,520) and $72,607 (2021: $99,540) respectively.

Useful life of intangible asset

The cost of intangible asset of the Group is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. For intangible asset, management estimates the useful life to be 10 years. The Group reviews annually the estimated useful life of intangible asset based on factors that include brand reputation, brand value perceived by customers and anticipated use of the asset. It is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these estimates brought about by changes in the factors mentioned. A reduction in the estimated useful life of intangible asset would increase amortisation expense and decrease non-current assets. The carrying amount of the Group’s intangible asset is disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements.

# 3 Revenue (cont’d)

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations

The table below discloses revenue expected to be recognised in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the reporting date:

| |2023|2024|2025|Total|

At 31 December 2022, the Group has unutilised tax losses of $377,000 (2021: $311,000) that are available for carry forward to offset against future taxable income.

The availability of unused tax losses for offsetting against future taxable profits of a subsidiary in Malaysia is subject to requirements and guidelines issued by the tax authority of Malaysia. The Group’s tax losses at 31 December 2021 of $242,000 can be utilised before 2031.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses of $Nil (2021: $242,000). No deferred tax assets has been recognised in respect of the remaining $377,000 (2021: $69,000) losses as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be sufficient to allow the related tax benefits to be realised.

# b) Financial risk management

The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and market price risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise adverse effects from these financial risks on the Group’s financial performance. The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below. The directors review and agree policies and procedures for the management of these risks.

There has been no change to the Group’s and the Company’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which the Group and the Company manage and measure financial risk.

# Foreign currency risk

The Group has currencies exposures arising from transactions, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of entities in the Group. The foreign currencies in which the Group’s and the Company’s currency risk arise are mainly United States Dollars (“USD”), Singapore Dollars (“SGD”) and Ringgit Malaysia (“MYR”).

At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company have the following financial assets and financial liabilities denominated in foreign currencies based on information provided to key management:

| | |2022|2021| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Denominated in:|USD|SGD|USD|SGD| |
|Group|Trade and other receivables|440,568|–|563,564|–|
| |Cash and cash equivalents|8,800,061|–|3,950,277|–|
| |Intra-group receivables|–|289,251|–|142,414|
| |Intra-group payables|–|(1,964,431)|–|(56,263)|
|Net financial assets/(liabilities)|denominated in foreign currencies|9,240,629|(1,675,180)|4,513,841|86,151|

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the USD and SGD exchange rates against the respective functional currencies of the Group’s entities, with all other variables held constant, of the Group’s and the Company’s profit after tax:

| |Increase/(decrease) in profit after tax| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| |2022| | |$|
|Group|USD against SGD|- Strengthened 5% (2021: 5%)|280,193| |
| |- Weakened 5% (2021: 5%)|(280,193)| | |
|USD against HKD|- Strengthened 5% (2021: 5%)|52,282| | |
| |- Weakened 5% (2021: 5%)|(52,282)| | |
|USD against MYR|- Strengthened 5% (2021: 5%)|48,185| | |
| |- Weakened 5% (2021: 5%)|(48,185)| | |
|SGD against MYR|- Strengthened 5% (2021: 5%)|(63,099)| | |
| |- Weakened 5% (2021: 5%)|63,099| | |

| | | | |Company|Increase/(decrease) in profit after tax|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|USD against SGD|- Strengthened 5%| |141,961| | |
| |- Weakened 5%| |(141,961)| | |

A 5% fluctuation in the MYR exchange rate against the functional currency of the Company, with all other variables held constant, will not have a significant impact on the Company’s profit for the financial years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021.

# Interest rate risk

The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk are restricted to their interest-bearing bank balances and fixed deposits as disclosed in Notes 16 to the financial statements respectively.

No interest rate sensitivity was performed since the Group’s exposure to interest rate is not significant.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the financial year ended 31 December 2022

# 24 Financial instruments (cont’d)

# b) Financial risk management (cont’d)

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. For receivables, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history, and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate to mitigate credit risk. For other financial assets, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with high credit quality counterparties.

# Significant increase in credit risk (cont’d)

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.

The Group does not have significant credit exposure except that the Group’s trade receivables comprise 1 debtor (2021: 1 debtor) that individually represented 4% (2021: 26%) of the trade receivables.

As the Group does not hold any collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of each class of financial instruments presented on the statements of financial positions.

# The following sets out the Group’s internal credit evaluation practices and basis for recognition and measurement of expected credit losses (“ECL”):

|Description of evaluation of financial assets|Basis for recognition and measurement of ECL|
|---|---|
|Counterparty has a low risk of default and does not have any past due amounts|12-month ECL|
|Contractual payments are more than 30 days past due or where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition|Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired|
|Contractual payments are more than 365 days past due or there is evidence of credit impairment|Lifetime ECL - credit-impaired|
|There is evidence indicating that the Group has no reasonable expectation of recovery of payments such as when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings|Write-off|

# Significant increase in credit risk

In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial asset as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information such as future economic and industry outlook, that is available without undue cost or effort.

In particular, the Group considers the following information when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition: Regardless of the evaluation of the above factors, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

The Group also assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial asset is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if it has an internal or external credit rating of “investment grade” as per globally understood definition, or the financial asset has a low risk of default; the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.

# Definition of default

The Group has determined the default events on a financial asset to be when there is evidence that the borrower is experiencing liquidity issues or when there is a breach of contract, such as a default of payment.

The Group considers the above as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable.

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 365 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

# Credit-impaired financial assets

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred, such as evidence that the borrower is in significant financial difficulty, there is a breach of contract such as default or past due event; there is information that it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.

# Estimation techniques and significant assumptions

an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results/key financial performance ratios of the debtor; and an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current financial year for recognition and measurement of credit loss allowances.

# Trade receivables

The Group has applied the simplified approach by using a provision matrix to measure the lifetime expected credit loss (“ECL”) allowance for trade receivables. Under the simplified approach, for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the loss allowance is measured at initial recognition and throughout the life of the receivable at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.

The Group estimates the expected credit loss rates for each category of past due status of the debtors based on historical credit loss experience adjusted as appropriate to reflect current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions with consideration of the current macroeconomics conditions on the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current financial year. The Group’s trade receivables are substantially in the category of below 60 days (2021: not past due to 30 days) where credit loss experience is insignificant.

The movements in the allowance for impairment loss on trade receivables are as follows:

| |12-month or lifetime ECL|Gross carrying amount|Loss allowance|Net carrying amount| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Group 2022|Lifetime|$969,565|$0|$969,565| | | | |

Non-trade amount due from subsidiaries The Group is organised into business units based on nature of the revenue for management and business segments purposes. The reportable segments are business impact assessment and recognition, exhibitions, business media and investment holding which are described below. Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for making decisions about allocation of resources and assessment of performances of each segment.

For the non-trade amount due from subsidiaries where impairment loss allowance is measured using 12 months ECL, the Company assessed the latest performance and financial position of the respective counterparties, and concluded that there has been no significant increase in the credit risk since the initial recognition of the financial assets. Accordingly, the Company measured the impairment loss allowance using 12-month ECL and determined that the ECL is insignificant.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group’s and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s and the Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities.

In managing its liquidity, Management monitors and reviews the Group’s and the Company’s forecasts of liquidity reserves (comprise cash and cash equivalents and undrawn borrowing facilities) on the basis of expected cash flows determined at the local level in the respective operating companies of the Group in accordance with limits set by the Group.

A Member who is a Relevant Intermediary may appoint more than two (2) proxies to attend, speak and vote at the AGM, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by him/her/it (which number and class of shares shall be specified).
Persons holding shares through relevant intermediaries, including SRS investors, who wish to participate in the AGM via webcast should contact their relevant intermediaries (e.g. their respective SRS Operators) through which they hold such shares as soon as possible in order for the necessary arrangements to be made for their participation in the AGM by 3.00 p.m. on 14 April 2023.
