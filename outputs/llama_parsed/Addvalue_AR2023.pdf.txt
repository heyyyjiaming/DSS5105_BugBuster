RICHARD DENNY
Non-Executive Chairman

# DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS

It is my pleasure to present my first report since assuming the role of Chairman with effect from 1 April 2023 from Dr Colin Chan, who has retired after serving at the helm of the Group for the past 29 years. On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”), I present to you the Annual Report of Addvalue Technologies Ltd (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 (“FY2023”).

SPC-Related Business achieved a 21% growth in terminal sales from FY2022, even though the number of terminals sold was the same as that of FY2022. This increase in revenue, from US$2.9 million in FY2022 to US$3.5 million in FY2023 resulted from the sale of higher value terminals. In addition, our cumulative recurring airtime revenue from the provisioning of IDRS data connection services grew by approximately 51% from US$365K in FY2022 to US$550K in FY2023. Equally, our ADR-Related Business grew by a noteworthy 133% from US$1.2 million in FY2022 to US$2.8 million in FY2023. This reflected our continual development in improving our ADR products and yielded encouraging results.

# FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

The Group recorded a commendable 38% increase in revenue to US$7.5 million in FY2023 as compared to US$5.5 million in FY2022. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in sales from our SPC-Related Business and our ADR-Related Business. During the year under review, our monthly airtime subscription revenue from the SPC-Related Business is expected to grow in tandem with the increasing IDRS terminals being launched into space over the next few years.

# CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

|REVENUE|SPC-RELATED BUSINESS REVENUE|
|---|---|
|US$7.5 million|US$4.0 million|
|NET ASSET VALUE PER ORDINARY SHARE|ADR-RELATED BUSINESS REVENUE|
|0.18 per Share|US$2.8 million|

# FINANCIAL POSITION

To strengthen the financial position of the Group and for working capital requirements, the Company completed a fund raising exercise to raise approximately S$2.0 million via the issuance of 135,120,000 new shares of the Company at S$0.0148 per share (“August 2022 Placement”) and another $4.66 million via the issuance of Redeemable Convertible Bonds (“RCB”) offered to all shareholders on a pro rata basis in August 2022 and November 2022 respectively. Together with the completion of the earlier placement exercises reported, the Company has issued a total of 717,430,117 new ordinary shares in FY2023 and improved our net asset value of the Group by US$3.4 million or 140.0%, from US$2.4 million as at 31 March 2022 to US$5.8 million as at 31 March 2023. The net asset value per ordinary share thus improved from 0.10 US cents per Share as at 31 March 2022 to 0.18 US cents per Share as at 31 March 2023. The fund-raising exercises have enabled the Company to retire the principal amount and interest accrued on a convertible loan note of S$3.45 million issued by the Company and subscribed by Mr. Paul Clark Burke on 6 August 2019, in addition to the retirement of other loans. These loan retirements have consequently reduced our Group’s debt-to-equity from 239.0% as at 31 March 2022 to 73.2% as at 31 March 2023, as well as having reversed the Group’s negative working capital position of US$4.94 million as at 31 March 2022 to a positive working capital position of US$2.2 million as at 31 March 2023.

# LOOKING FORWARD

Riding on the initial success of our business transformation plan, our strategy now is to focus our efforts on two main engines of growth, namely the SPC-Related Business and the ADR-Related Business:

# I. SPC-Related Business (relating to our IDRS product and related services):

a. The traditional means by which Low Orbit Earth (“LEO”) satellite operators have connected with their in-orbit spacecraft is via a number of ground station antennae positioned around the world and providing line of sight connectivity. Given that the fast-moving satellites provide a very limited connectivity window, measured in minutes, to any single point on earth, the LEO operator has traditionally required a large number of ground stations to provide extended periods of connectivity. This inherent design is thus costly to establish and to maintain over the long term, as well as being severely limited in functionality for the increasing reliance on constant and near real-time data. Today LEO satellite operators need much better data communications technologies to overcome such inflexible and expensive ground station architecture.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023  05

# CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

b. Since making its commercial in-orbit debut with the launch of the first commercial LEO satellite from Capella Space in late 2020, the IDRS has been the only data communication solution capable of offering almost-real-time, always-on, anytime, any geographical place and bi-directional data connectivity services over the Inmarsat BGAN satellite network. With the rapid growth in the development and deployment of LEO satellites for almost every conceivable application and fuelled by global interests such as climate change, advanced communications needs, geopolitical events, strategic opportunities and commercial developments, we believe the IDRS is well poised to take full advantage of the potential of this new market segment of the space industry.

c. The range of IDRS customers that have been publicly announced with their consents have now been expanded to include, amongst others, such respected operators as Blacksky Global, Heron (formerly known as Analytic Space Inc), Synspective, Atomos Space and Astroscale. They represent a spread of LEO satellite technologies for a wide variety of space-based applications from earth observation to remote sensing to space-tug services and space debris management.

d. As at the time of this report, we have an order book of some US$3.7 million and a pipeline of sale leads with high confidence of a further US$3.6 million.

e. Notwithstanding that only two further satellites equipped with IDRS were launched in March 2023, our recurring airtime revenue from the provisioning of IDRS data connection services grew by 51% from US$365K in FY2022 to US$550K in FY2023. Based on our current understanding of our respective customers’ launch programs and their launch service providers such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab and PSLV, we estimate at least 12 units of the IDRS flight terminals will be launched over the next 12 months. The new launches will add to the recurring airtime revenue from our provision of data connection services. Therefore, we expect an accelerated growth for both IDRS terminals and recurring IDRS airtime revenue over the next 12 months.

06 ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

# II. ADR-Related Business

(relating to the sales of our reconfigurable embedded hardware solutions developed for software defined applications which also includes Software Defined Radio (“SDR”))

# a.

Over the past years the development of several SDR modules under various contracts with our partners, including a large local technology company, has paved the way for our supply of such modules to generate this new stream of revenue. The contract of S$3.6m with an optional purchase of S$1.6m was awarded in Feb 2022 (refer to our SGX Announcement dated 15 February 2022). We have also received new design contracts which shall be the enablers for subsequent supply revenue, with some of the developmental work likely to be completed within FY2024.

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect the Group will perform significantly better in its revenue in FY2024 relative to FY2023 and are confident that the growth trend will continue for the next 12 - 24 months.

# b.

The ultra-high-quality standard demanded by our clients and the challenges in managing the supply chains and manufacturing processes have collectively elevated the overall capabilities of our company in managing the supply chain and in manufacturing such ultra-high-quality products. With the successful deliveries of the products, we are confident of receiving repeated purchase orders from the same client. With this strong credential, we are now attracting new customers with similar quality demands for our design and supply services.

# c.

Since the successful launch of the ADRS1000™ module, a state-of-the-art 16-channel Direct Sampling re-configurable wireless System-on-Module (SOM), we successfully shipped and fulfilled customers’ orders in anti-drone and smart RF sensing industries. While we continue to receive orders from these industrial segments for delivery in FY2024, we are also ratcheting up our sales and marketing efforts to address new market opportunities from other industries, where highly complex software defined applications are now moving.

# d.

As at the time of this report, we have an order book from ADR-Related Business including new design and supply contracts of some US$3.0 million and a pipeline of sale leads with high confidence of some US$5.0 million (these include optional orders of approximately US$1.3 million).

# A WORD OF THANKS

First of all, on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Dr Colin Chan Kum Lok, who has retired on 31 March 2023, for his leadership and invaluable contributions as Executive Chairman (and previously as Chairman & Chief Executive Officer) over the past 29 years. Of particular note is the work undertaken by Dr Chan in helping the Group to successfully navigate unprecedented times and challenges as well as in transforming the Group to become a global leader in providing near real time and on demand connectivity services in the LEO satellite industry.

I would also wish to express my utmost and sincere appreciation to our much cherished management and staff for their unyielding hard work, contributions, commitment and dedication. I would also like to say a big thank you to our valued partners, suppliers and customers for their strong and unrelenting support over the years. My earnest gratitude is also extended to my fellow Directors for their invaluable contributions and guidance in helping the Group to meet and overcome the many challenges over this past year.

Last but not least, I would like to thank you, our steadfast Shareholders, for your patience and trust, as well as for standing by us through these past years. I look forward to your continued support in helping us all to realise the success we are striving for throughout FY2024 and beyond.

Non-Executive Chairman

ANNUAL REPORT 2023 07

# FINANCIAL REVIEW

# TURNOVER

The Group continue its business expansion journey and registered a turnover of US$7.5 million in FY2023, an improvement of more than US$2 million from the FY2022’s turnover of US$5.5 million, a commendable 38% growth in revenue. The increase was mainly attributable to increase in sales from ADR-Related Business and SPC-Related Business. SPC-Related Business delivered 19 IDRS terminals during the year under review, with more than half delivered in 2H2023. We also see a growth of more than 100% achieved for ADR-Related Business in FY2023 over FY2022 with about 80% of the revenue in 2H2023.

The administrative expenses of the Group increased from US$2,442,000 in FY2022 to US$2,950,000 in FY2023 due primarily to increased legal and professional service expenses incurred on corporate activities as well as higher manpower costs and related expenses as a result of increased headcount in the quality and operational area, in gearing up for new processes in the SPC and ADR-Related Businesses of the Group.

The lower finance expenses incurred by the Group in FY2023 was attributed mainly to lower borrowings following the settlement of most of the Group’s FY2022 outstanding loans with the funds raised from placement exercises in 1HFY2022, offset by new finance expenses incurred for the new loans acquired in 2H2023, including the S$4.66 million RCB which was completed in November 2022.

Consequence to the above, the Group has significantly reduced its net loss to US$3.0 million in FY2023 compared to a net loss of US$8.0 million in FY2022.

# PROFITABILITY

The Group recorded a gross profit of US$3.6 million against a gross profit margin of 47.6% for FY2023 compared to a gross profit of US$3.8 million against a gross profit margin of 69.2% for FY2022. The lower gross profit margin in FY2023 was attributed principally to the delivery of more low yielding products in FY2023 relative to FY2022. The lower gross profit for FY2023 was principally due to the diminished profit margin of some of the STC products that are coming to their end-of-life.

The selling and distribution expenses of the Group increased by US$319,000 or 100.6% from US$317,000 in FY2022 to US$636,000 in FY2023 due mainly to new marketing initiatives, including additional marketing and overseas travelling expenses incurred for participation in overseas exhibitions and sales trips since the opening up of air travel in April 2022.

# LONG-TERM ASSETS

The increase in property, plant and equipment of the Group was attributed mainly to purchase of certain new lab equipment required to cater for new in-house processes for the new business expansion.

The intangible assets relate mainly to the development expenses incurred (net of amortisation and impairment) as the Group continues to develop its proprietary technologies and products, including its space resilient technologies and new spin-off products and services. The decreased was due mainly to lower development expenses incurred in FY2023 following the completion of most of the projects, albeit further impairment of certain development expenses and the commencement of amortisation of part of the completed space resilient projects.

# FINANCIAL REVIEW

During the year, the Company invested additional capital of US$7.5 million in one of its subsidiaries via capitalisation of amount due from that subsidiary company. This increase was off-setted by further allowance for impairment losses of US$8 million.

# CURRENT ASSETS

The increase in inventories was attributed mainly to the purchase of materials for the fulfilment of outstanding customers’ orders, especially from the ADR-related business.

The increase in trade receivables was due to sales towards the end of FY2023 while the decrease in other receivables, deposits and prepayments was due to the lower prepayments to suppliers.

The decrease in other investment was due to the recognition of the fair value loss arising from the Company’s other equity investment as at 31 March 2023.

# CURRENT LIABILITIES

The increase in trade payables were attributed mainly to higher inventories carried to support the higher sales volume deliveries towards the year end.

The decrease in other payables and accruals were attributed mainly to the settlement of amounts due to directors of the Company and staff during FY2023.

The increase in provisions was due mainly to the higher provision for Directors’ fees for FY2023 arising from the increase in the number of directors.

The decrease in borrowings was attributed principally to loan settlements during FY2023, including the full settlement of the 2019 Convertible Loan Notes.

The decrease in lease liabilities was due to the payments during the year.

The decrease in contract liabilities, which relate to advances and deposits from customers, was mainly due to fulfilment of deliveries during FY2023.

# Consequence to the above:

1. The debt-to-equity of the Group (defined as the ratio of all interest-bearing loans of the Group to the shareholders’ fund of the Group) decreased from 239.0% as at 31 March 2022 to 73.2% as at 31 March 2023;
2. The working capital position of the Group was reversed from a negative working capital of US$4.94 million as at 31 March 2022 to a positive working capital of US$2.22 million as at 31 March 2023;
3. The net cash flow of the Group reversed from cash generated from operation of US$0.4 million in FY2022 to cash used in operations of US$2.7 million in FY2023, of which was substantially covered by cash generated from financing activities in FY2023; and
4. The net asset value of the Group improved by US$3.4 million or 140.0% from US$2.4 million as at 31 March 2022 to US$5.8 million as at 31 March 2023 while the net asset value per ordinary share improved from 0.10 US cents per Share as at 31 March 2022 to 0.18 US cents per Share as at 31 March 2023.

The movement in capital reserve was due to the reversal of the equity portion of the convertible loan notes upon full settlement.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# SUSTAINABILITY BOARD’S STATEMENT

# GRI 2-22

Dear Stakeholders,

The Group is committed to sustainable development and recognises the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance, including those related to Climate Change (“ESG”) responsibility, especially ESG factors that are material to its business.

At Addvalue, we always strive to promote long-term value creation in the pursuit of our commercial objectives and attain sustainable value for our relevant category of stakeholders (“Stakeholders”). Sustainability is an integral part and is embedded in our normal course of business. We engage with our Stakeholders in identifying business imperatives to drive improvements in sustainability.

First, we believe that the sustainability of our business is entwined with the global movement on environmental sustainability. Through our deliberate effort in our business transformation over the years, we have scored successes in pivoting our connectivity technologies towards fisheries sustainability and a wide array of autonomous IoT-based environmental surveillance applications, including weather monitoring, utilities efficiency and animal tracking.

Second, we make sustainability priority in our partnerships and climate protection a joint task. As the curation of the materials is an integral part of our product development programs, we aspire to nurture a supply ecosystem with our vendors who have the shared principle. Indeed, it takes the collective actions to build sustainability throughout the whole value chain of supply.

Amidst the global business environment still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, we are also seeing more countries being affected by floods and heatwaves caused by increasing rainfall and rising temperatures caused by climate changes. More countries, including Singapore, have joined the net-zero target by 2050, which is accompanied by stronger regulations, including a steeper carbon tax enacted for Singapore companies, and mandatory climate reporting requirements. Addvalue recognises the importance and is committed to adopt the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) reporting in a phased approach in the coming years in accordance to Singapore Exchange’s (“SGX”) requirements. We continue to meet our corporate social responsibility goals by embracing our core values and adapting to challenges. As always, sustainable digital transformation for our clients will continue to drive our resilience.

The Board and Management are committed to further enhance stakeholders’ value through our robust corporate governance framework by adopting a Sustainability Reporting Policy (“SR Policy”) in FY2023, covering reporting structure, materiality assessment and processes in identifying and monitoring material sustainability factors. This SR Policy has been put in place and serves as a point of reference in the conduct of our sustainability reporting, where we manage ESG related risks and opportunities. The Board maintains oversight of the identification and assessment of ESG issues that are material to operations and stakeholders. For this year’s Sustainability Report, we have engaged our internal auditor to review our internal analysis of our environment data and internal data collection process.

We have established a Sustainability Committee (“SC”) responsible for overseeing our sustainability targets. Under the purview of the Board’s Risk Committee, the SC is led by our Chief Executive Officer along with the support of our management executives. The SC ensures the alignment of our business objectives with our ESG targets and holds the responsibility to communicate our sustainability progress to the Board.

We engaged our Internal Audit Function to review the current sustainability reporting processes. The internal review was conducted in accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing issued by The Institute of Internal Auditors. The scope included a risk-based review of the processes including but not limited to the sustainability governance and management; the identification, prioritisation and assessment of ESG-related risks and opportunities; reporting relevant sustainability information; climate-related disclosures; and compliance against local regulatory reporting requirements. We have not sought external assurance for this reporting year.

We remain focused and have taken steps to ensure a diverse and inclusive workforce; a wide breadth of opinions and backgrounds play a large part in our success. The Board reinforced its governance over sustainability by adopting a Board Diversity Policy in FY2022 and we welcomed our first female Board member to our Board in FY2023. The Group places importance on diversity for an effective Board and for the sustainability of the businesses.

In this report, we are pleased to share with you our progress for FY2023 and our compass towards sustainable development. We look forward to building on our commitment for a sustainable future. We thank you for your patience and support during these difficult times. Together, we will navigate Addvalue through today’s challenging phases.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

# GRI 2-9, 3-1

Our materiality assessment performed involved our employees engaging in our relevant category stakeholders (“Stakeholders”) in our normal course of business by identifying sustainability factors deemed material to the Group’s businesses and our Stakeholders so as to allow us to channel our resources to create sustainable value for our Stakeholders. This is reviewed annually to reflect changes in business operations, environment, Stakeholders’ feedback and sustainability trends.

We have adopted the 4-step approach as follows in deriving our material sustainability factors.

# IDENTIFICATION

Through discussions with the SR Committee by considering various factors such as industry trends, Stakeholder expectations, and regulatory requirements, we have identified the various ESG factors.

# PRIORITISATION

The ESG factors will be prioritised based on its importance to the stakeholders and the importance to the Group. The material factors will be shortlisted for reporting.

# VALIDATION

The shortlisted material ESG factors will then be internally validated by the Group’s SR Committee consisting of senior management and submitted to the Risk Committee of the Board for approval. This promotes the alignment of sustainability factors to the Group’s corporate objective.

# REVIEW

The material ESG factors will be reviewed on an annual basis and will be subject to amendments should there be any changes in the business operations or market conditions. The Report is also open to feedback from our Stakeholders for our continual improvement.

In considering Addvalue’s activities, impacts, and the substantive expectations and interest of our Stakeholders, we have applied the four reporting principles in the above 4-step approach.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# BUSINESS ETHICS AND EXCELLENCE

Acting responsibly and ethically is crucial to maintaining the trust and confidence of our Stakeholders. We strive to maintain high ethical standards and continually ensure that we comply with the relevant laws and regulations. Our efforts include fostering an ethical working environment by requiring our employees to follow the Addvalue Corporate Policies and Business Conduct Guidelines, which is regularly reviewed and updated. Apart from maintaining our high ethical standards, Addvalue is committed to building a culture of risk awareness that promotes good corporate governance and a sound system of internal controls.

The Group also take measures to guard against cyber security risks in order to protect confidential information for both our Stakeholders. The Group has regular seminars on the importance of the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) compliance to ensure all our employees are fully aware as part of maintaining high ethical standards of our Group.

# ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has put in place an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Framework which assists Addvalue in managing inherent risks arising across the Group’s business, at a macro level. An annual ERM exercise is also conducted to identify and assess key risks.

The framework is a structured and discipline approach to identifying and assessing key risks and their potential impact on the achievement of the Group’s key objectives. Control measures are put in place to mitigate the risks with Addvalue’s risk appetite at a holistic level rather than in silos or isolation within areas or functions. This improves the organisation’s agility to respond to risk events.

# CONFLICT OF INTEREST

All employees are required to complete a Conflict of Interest Declaration Form upon joining and update Human Resources as and when circumstances change. Since FY2021, all employees are required to declare their Conflict of Interest on an annual basis.

# BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

Addvalue has zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption. As such, the Group has put in place a whistle-blowing policy for employees to raise concerns on any possible misconduct or improprieties within the Group. Addvalue has also reviewed and updated its whistle-blowing policy for greater effectiveness this year. The “Whistle-blower Reporting Form” may be used for reporting purposes and it is available on Addvalue’s Intranet. This platform encourages employees to raise concerns or disclose any improprieties, without the fear of reprisals. We have achieved our target of sustaining our zero-corruption record. There was no bribery or corruption incident reported this year (FY2022: Nil, FY2021: Nil). We aim to sustain our zero-corruption record in the long run through pertinent actions to ensure that our employees, governance body members, and business partners are aware of our anti-corruption and whistle-blowing policies and abide by all applicable laws and regulations. This is aligned with our overall strategy to increase investor confidence and achieve business excellence.

# COMMUNICATION TO EMPLOYEES

Addvalue’s Human Resource department has achieved 100% (FY2022: 100%, FY2021: 100%) communication of our anti-corruption policies to all our employees this year. This target is consistent with management’s KPI and we will continue to ensure that these policies are communicated to all our employees on a periodic basis. Details of the whistle-blowing policies, code of conduct, and anti-corruption policies are made available to all Singapore employees on the intranet. For all newly joined staff (local and overseas), Addvalue’s clear stance against corruption is communicated through a detailed briefing of the corporate policies and the consequences of violation of any policies, which may include severe penalties, disciplinary measures, or even dismissal. This ultimate goal is to promote the highest standards of trust in all of our actions and relationships.

This ensures that employees’ decision making and professional judgement are not influenced by undue personal interests that creates a conflict of interest to the Group.

32 ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# COMMUNICATION TO GOVERNANCE BODY MEMBERS

All newly appointed Directors will be informed on the details of our anti-corruption policies. They are required to read them thoroughly to familiarise themselves with the policies and understand the key principles of fairness, honesty, openness, decency, integrity, and respect. Addvalue expects the governance body members to hold their integrity, and act in the best interest of Addvalue on behalf of their stakeholders.

# ECONOMIC FACTORS

# GRI 2-6, 201-4

# FINANCIAL GRANTS

The Group receives a relatively substantial amount of financial grants from the Singapore Government. In FY2023, we received US$817,540 (FY2022: US$1,970,450, FY2021: US$1,198,102) from the Singapore Government, of which none were present in the shareholding structure of Addvalue. These grants include subsidies for development activities to build our base of propriety products as well as applications and processes to improve our operations and productivity. With the government’s support, Addvalue is on track for further expansion of our competencies and our technological innovation.

# SUPPLY CHAIN

The Group strives to establish a diverse and sustainable supply chain to support Addvalue’s value creation in the long term. The management of our supply chain is an integral part of our operations to reduce risk of disruptions, increase efficiency, and protect our brand reputation. Our supply chain consists of vendors based in stable countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, United States, South Korea, Denmark, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, where risks of operational disruption is minimal.

Due to the COVID-19 situation, operational and shipment delays are unavoidable. We have communicated to our customers that there will be a longer delivery lead time due to worldwide components shortages. To deal with supply chain disruptions, we plan to diversify our sources and secure supplies early. In the short term, we aim to reduce lead times by ensuring that all our inventory is within reach and outside of impacted areas. Addvalue will continue to maintain our active sourcing activities to minimise the risk of shipment disruptions. We have expanded our supply chain over the recent years by obtaining alternate source of suppliers1 in case of severe shortages. As a long-term measure, we will implement supply chain risk management assessments and practices to mitigate potential risks and improve our resilience and responsiveness to disruptions. One of the measures implemented was to perform materials planning with forward forecasting of our stable products to ensure we have enough materials for the future production build.

As part of our supply chain operations, we recognize the critical role in our materials sourcing and are committed to always improve and to maintain the quality of materials used for production. Our vendors must meet the prerequisites set out in Addvalue’s product quality requirements. We conduct our Vendor evaluation and Qualification procedure annually to determine whether the minimum requirements set have been met. We aim to continue this annual assessment to ensure that quality is maintained.

1 Suppliers refer to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) providers, vendors, and manufacturers.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

GRI 308-1

Environmental problems continue to threaten our sustainability in the future, making the need for environmental preservation increasingly crucial among businesses and communities. In our commitment to the environment, we recognise our responsibility to mitigate climate change and reduce our negative impact on the environment with our conservation efforts. During the reporting period (FY2022: Nil, FY2021: Nil), the Group did not identify any non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations. We seek to maintain and uphold our strong compliance record and manage our efforts to preserve the environment. We believe that our strong compliance record aligns with our business strategy and will attract like-minded vendors who also advocate for high sustainability standards.

# PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION

We take a holistic approach to product development sustainability by ensuring every opportunity is provided to review the types and quantities of materials used and processes applied to the production of our products for commercial purposes. Our goal is to minimise materials waste and obsolescence by utilising eco-friendly materials. New packaging materials used in our new product lines were chosen from recyclable materials and EPE based materials instead of plastics/paper materials.

We believe the sustainability of our supply chain is an integral part to our sustainability performance. Our existing vendors and contract manufacturers are evaluated on their environmental impact through our annual Vendor evaluation and Qualification procedure. Factors we consider include their efforts towards recycling, incorporation of environmentally friendly materials, energy conservation, environmental certifications, and their use of toxic or hazardous substance materials. From the feedback of such assessment, 93% (FY2022: 92%, FY2021: 91%) of our selected key suppliers has met with our minimum requirements set. We will continue this effort to evaluate our suppliers on their environmental preservation to ensure minimum adverse impact on the environment in FY2024.

# GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

In our effort to conserve energy, we have began tracking our Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions in FY2022. Our Scope 2 indirect emissions via purchased electricity amounts to approximately 82 metric tons of CO2 (FY2022: 89.5 metric tons of CO). This is in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations.

For all our new vendors and contract manufacturers, we conduct a review assessment which includes an onsite assessment of their factory premises and a quality assurance audit. Addvalue recognises the importance of assessing any negative environmental impacts caused by our supply chain. We have incorporated the environmental criteria as part of our screening procedures for all new suppliers and have ensured that they comply accordingly. We have onboarded one new supplier this year (FY2022: two new suppliers (100%)) and screened them using our environmental criteria. This further reinforces our stance towards environmental sustainability, playing our part in making sure that all our engagements are environmentally friendly.

# WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING

The Group strives to create a paperless culture in the office by implementing the 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Addvalue contributes by reducing our paper usage through double-sided printing, reusing single sided prints for internal documents, and recycling used paper.

As part of the Group’s sustainability commitment, hazardous waste will be disposed of responsibly in compliance with relevant local and international environmental, safety, and health regulations, as well as in line with industry standards.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

We work closely with our landlord, Panasonic on its Waste and Resource Management System (“WRMS”) Program which is in line with the National Environment Agency’s (“NEA”) mandatory reporting procedures. We consolidate our general waste in centralised waste bins which will be collected by Panasonic’s appointed waste collector. Recyclable waste items such as paper and cartons are collected in a similar fashion through the centralised bins. Addvalue’s paper and cartons waste is not considered material, as such, we are exempted from the reporting requirements. Being a registered producer under the Resource Sustainability Act (“RSA”), we directly report to NEA on an annual basis our Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“EEE”) Supply Declaration. This is mandated by NEA where Addvalue is required to declare the amount (i.e., weight) of regulated products supplied in Singapore for electronic-waste management.

# SOCIAL FACTORS

As a technology developer and innovator, we place importance on our workforce capabilities, resourcefulness, experience, skills and knowhow. We recognise the key role our employees play in contributing to our business success and growth and they are our greatest asset.

Another important sustainability focus will be the development and social well-being of every community in which we operate in, especially to our very own employees, with emphasis on providing them with sustainable and inclusive labour practices. There were no incidents of non-compliance with socioeconomic laws this year (FY2022: Nil; FY2021: Nil), and we seek to maintain Addvalue’s strong compliance record through relevant policies and initiatives.

# SUSTAINABLE LABOUR PRACTICES

Our sustainable labour practices include providing equal opportunity, non-discrimination policy, effective communications between management and employees, providing work life balance, and sufficient attention to occupational health and safety hazards. The Group believes in having a diverse and inclusive culture, where all employees are welcomed and treated fairly. Having these policies will help to ensure employees to not only lead a well-balanced work life, but also to incorporate a sustained positive attitude for continuous improvement towards their work, customers and other stakeholders of the Group.

# WORK LIFE BALANCE

# DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

The Group believes in respecting and valuing diversity in race, cultures, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, genetics, disability, age or any other factors. Our equal opportunity practices are necessary to create an open mindedness, productive and creative community that the Group needs to drive its growth and sustainability. We seek to create an inclusive and fair working environment by providing our people with equal opportunities and adopting merit-based practices for recruitment, selection, and promotion. It is very important to us that - irrespective of gender, age, background or any other aspects – all employees are valued and can devote their individual strengths, experience and potential to the Group.

We value inclusiveness not only in our employees but also in our board composition. The Group’s Board Diversity Policy sets out that diversity at the Board level is an essential element to ensuring the achievement of its strategic objectives. All Board appointments will be made based on merit, taking into account the skills, experience, independence and knowledge that the particular director can bring to the Board and without compromising on the diversity of the Board. In FY2023, the Board has appointed a female director. Although there is currently no director from a younger age group appointed in the Board, the Board does not rule out the possibility of appointing such director if a suitable candidate is nominated for the Board’s consideration.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# SOCIAL FACTORS

While in FY2023 we have managed to improve our turnover rate to be under 15% from 23% in FY2022 which in turn has increased our hiring rate to 19% for FY2023. This is due to additional manpower required to replace the resigned staff and for the business expansion expected in FY2023 and beyond. The Group recognizes the importance of keeping our employee turnover rate low and allowing us to retain key skills and knowledge without affecting our recruitment budget, team balance, and employees’ morale. We will continue to strive to keep our hiring and turnover rates below 15%.

As the well-being of our staff is critical to the Group, we strive to actively promote healthy work practices. Accordingly, in order to encourage all our employees to do a yearly health check, we have extended the additional relevant allowance to all employees since last year, instead of only employees above 40 years of age in the prior years. Regular health talks and annual health screening programs are organised for our employees. In order to inculcate healthy eating habits, the Group also organised a ‘Fruit Day’ once a month, whereby each employee will be given a healthy fruit on ‘Fruit Day’.

In 2022, the Ministry of Manpower reported a recruitment rate and resignation rate of 3.1% (2021: 2.8%, 2020: 2.1%) and 2.1% (2021: 2.0%, 2020: 1.5%) respectively in the Information and Communications industry. While we acknowledged there is room for improvement, given our lean structure, we believe that our rates are within the reasonable range.

# TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Addvalue believes that our people are our greatest assets. In order to adapt to the rapid changes in the environment and ride the waves of technological advancements smoothly, it is important to ensure that our employees keep abreast with technology trends and are well equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge. Hence, the Group provides in-house training on product and technology competency and sends the relevant staff for external courses to upgrade their skills as and when necessary. The professional courses cover both technical skills such as design technologies and aviation product design, as well as business skills such as corporate branding and strategic training. The trainees are required to conduct a sharing session to their team members to share the knowledge and insights gained. This boosts the productivity level and performance at both individual and organisational levels.

# EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND SAFETY

Our Group regards workplace safety as an essential part of office admin operation. We comply with Workplace Safety and Health regulatory procedures. A safety committee is put in place and safety inspections are performed regularly. Our Group sends employees to first-aid courses on a regular basis to ensure that our team is equipped to provide first-aid help promptly when there is a need. We target to have at least one certified first-aid employee allocated at each department. In addition, safety manuals are made accessible through the intranet and communicated to our staff via email and orientation program. There were no (FY2022: Nil, FY2021: one) health and safety incidents in FY2023. We will continue to promote safety in the workplace and have emphasised the importance of vigilance to our employees.

As part of our continual efforts to upgrade the knowledge of our directors on sustainability reporting and to meet the requirement of listing rule 720 (7) of SGX-ST, we confirm that six Directors or 86% of our Directors have completed the approved sustainability training course, ESG Essentials offered by the Singapore Institute of Directors and one Director has already registered his training in the month of July 2023.

The average hours of training that our employees have undertaken in FY2023 is 20.6 hours (FY2022: 9.3 hours, FY2021: 5.7 hours). This was an increase of 11.3 hours (FY2022: 3.6 hours, FY2021: 15.5 hours) which is an approximate rise of 122%. The average training hours per employee category is as follows:

|Employee Category|Average Training Hours|FY2022|FY2021|
|---|---|---|---|
|ADMINISTRATIVE|6.60 HOURS|10.61|6.38|
|PRODUCTION|81.36 HOURS|NIL|NIL|

|MALE|27.70 HOURS|8.39|6.41|
|FEMALE|8.08 HOURS|11.39|5.20|

We focus on in-house training for newer employees on product knowledge and on-the-job training. The internal trainings include but is not limited to Printed Circuit Boards Assembly (“PCBA”) Process, Box Build and Process Flows. Overall, more training was provided to all staff across the company with more skill-based training was attended by Production and Technical staff during the year to level up their competency and capability to improve their work efficiency and also to improve our quality of our products.

We will continue to target an achievement of an average of 20 hours per staff in the short term, and 40 hours per staff in the long term. Addvalue’s training requirements are as per ISO’s requirement which is also linked to management’s KPI.

# CAREER DEVELOPMENT

In addition, the Group review our employees’ performance regularly to recognise their achievements at work, identify their training needs, and set personal targets for the next review period to further stretch their potential. This aids our employees’ personal development and enhances employee satisfaction, which correlates with improved organisational performance. In FY2023, all of our employees, including the senior management, received their annual performance and career development reviews (FY2022: 100%, FY2021: 100%). We will continue our regular career development reviews for all our employees in the future.

# PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

Our vision is to be widely recognised as a world leading global mobile satellite service (“MSS”) player in the satellite communications industry. While we have been successful in adopting new technological advancements for new product development, we are also scaling up our compliance for product safety and reliability. During the Design and Development Phase, our experienced engineers design and maintain test plans based on the product requirements. The testing conducted include Regulatory Compliance test and Product Reliability test, and the test reports are used to follow up with the design team to resolve any issues faced before embarking onto mass production and commercialisation of the product. With the test plans in place, we aim to verify and evaluate the product performance, stability, functionality, and application and mobility of our technology. We also ensure that our products are delivered in a responsible manner through a framework designed to manage issues relating to heat and radiation emissions of product when operating. Our products, bearing the “Addvalue enabled” label, are certified for compliance with relevant safety standards. Our customers’ experience as well as their health and safety are of utmost importance to us. Our products and services are regularly assessed based on the requirements for Regulatory Compliance and Country Type Approval. This may include compliance necessary for certification to CE, FCC, IC, and Safety (IEC 60950) regulations. Our reliability and quality control engineers conduct visual and functional inspections to identify areas of improvement to be made or replacements required. With our strong commitment to maintaining high quality and reliability of our solutions, there has been no incidents of non-compliance with regulations or voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our products this year (FY2022: Nil, FY2021: Nil).

“We shall develop products and solutions that fit the aspirations of every conceivable end user. Our products and solutions will be so pervasive in the market that we become the de facto brand synonymous with innovation, user experience and performance.”

# SUPPLIER SOCIAL ASSESSMENT

Being a committed and responsible business requires us to integrate sustainable and socially responsible practices into our supply chain management as well. We understand the importance of considering social factors in the choice of our suppliers, such as ISO 45001 - Occupation Health and Safety certification, promotion of safe and cohesive working environment, compliance with safety regulations and the supplier’s efforts to respect the human rights. We have incorporated the social criteria in our screening procedure for new suppliers4 since 1 September 2021 and we aim to maintain such assessment. We have onboarded one new supplier (100%) this year (FY2022: 2) and screened them using our social criteria. This allows us to mitigate or prevent any negative impacts to the society at the early stage of structuring contracts of other agreements.

4 Suppliers refer to Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) providers, vendors, and manufacturers.

Costs of such advice would be borne by the Company.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023         51

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE

Principle 2: The board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.

# PROVISION 2.1

# INDEPENDENT ELEMENT ON THE BOARD

The Board comprises six members, three of whom, namely Mr Richard J Denny, Mr Wong Ming Ghee, Bernard and Ms Goh Liang Choo are Independent Directors. The remaining three members comprise two Non-Executive Directors and one Executive Director who is also the CEO.

The criterion for independence is based on the definition given in the Code and in the Listing Rules. The Code has defined an “independent” director as one who is independent in conduct, character and judgment and has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgment with a view to the best interests of the company. Under the Listing Rules, an independent director is not one who is or has been employed by the company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three financial years; or not one who has an immediate family member who is, or has been in any of the past three financial years, employed by the company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee.

All the Independent Directors of the Company have confirmed their independence and that they do not have any relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of their independent judgment pursuant to the Listing Rules. None of the independent Directors have served on Board for more than nine years from the date of their respective appointments.

# PROVISIONS 2.2 AND 2.3

# COMPOSITION OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE BOARD

Under Rule 210(5)(c) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual, the Board must have at least two Independent Directors who make up at least one-third of the board. In the event of any retirement or resignation which renders the issuer unable to meet any of the foregoing requirements, the Company should endeavour to fill the vacancy within two months, but in any case not later than three months. The composition of our Board complies with the Listing Rule.

Under Provision 2.2 of the Code, the independent directors should make up a majority of the board where the chairman is not an independent director. Under Provision 2.3 of the Code, the non-executive directors should make up a majority of the board.

Dr Colin Chan Kum Lok retired from his position as Executive Chairman and Director on 31 March 2023 and assumed the role of Advisor to the Board and to the CEO with effect on and from 1 April 2023. With the retirement of Dr Chan from his position as Executive Chairman and following the recommendations of the Code, the Board appointed Mr Richard J Denny as the Independent and Non-executive Chairman of the Company with effect from 1 April 2023. With the appointment of an Independent Chairman, there is no requirement under the Code to have a Lead Independent Director. Accordingly, Mr Richard J Denny ceased to be the Lead Independent Director with effect from the same date.

Consequently, the reconstituted Board with effect from 1 April 2023 comprises six directors of which three are Non-Executive and Independent Directors, two are Non-Executive Directors and one is an Executive Director. The majority of the Board comprises Non-Executive Directors in compliance with Provision 2.3 of the Code. The reconstituted Board has a good balance of authority and power within the Board. In addition, each of the NRC, AC and RC, which assists the Board in its functions, comprises all Independent Directors. For the Board Exco comprising a Non-Executive Director who is the chairman and an Executive Director, all decisions have to be unanimous, otherwise, the matter will be referred to the Board for approval. Hence, the Board is of the view that there is a strong independence element within the Board which is consistent with Principle 2 of the Code.

# PROVISION 2.4 BOARD SIZE AND DIVERSITY

The composition of the Board is reviewed on an annual basis by the NRC. The NRC is of the opinion that the current size of the Board is adequate, taking into account the nature and scope of the Group’s operations.

The Board has in place a Board Diversity Policy to ensure that the Board has an appropriate level of diversity of thoughts and backgrounds to enable wider perspectives which encourage more effective discussions, better decision-making and governance of the Company and its businesses. The Board members collectively have the necessary skills and competencies, covering business and management experience, industry knowledge and strategic planning skills, for the effective functioning of the Board and informed decision-making.

Annually the NRC reviews and assesses the Board composition, and recommends the appointment of new directors, where applicable. For new and continuing appointments, the NRC will consider factors such as skills, experience, age, gender, educational and professional background, tenure of service and other relevant personal attributes that are important and needed to support good decision making at the Board level. As gender is an important aspect of diversity, the NRC will strive to ensure that the search for candidates for Board appointments will include female candidates that meet the set requirements for a new candidate, if the opportunity arises.

Mr Tan Khai Pang, one of the co-founders of the Company has more than 30 years of experience in the business. Mr Richard J Denny, with over 40 years of experience in the space and satellite sector, held a range of positions spanning across the technical and operational functions of Inmarsat plc (“Inmarsat”) and was responsible for Inmarsat’s fleet of satellites, network operations activities, satellite gateways, spectrum regulatory and spectrum management activities as well as satellite navigation services. Mr Paul C Burke is an entrepreneur with over 25 years of experience in the aviation industry and product design and manufacturing for the e-mobility market. Besides being the Asia Pacific Region Head of The Lubrizol Corporation for 10 years, Mr Wong Ming Ghee, Bernard has a career spanning 36 years with Mobil, BP and Lubrizol, with 19 years based in the PRC. Hence, he has vast experience in the petroleum and chemicals industries with focus on Asia Pacific. Mr Chua Chwee Koh has 22 years of experience in Singapore Armed Forces and subsequently spent another 17 years with Certis CISCO in leading and transforming its business operations. Ms Goh brings with her more than 30 years of management and international experience spanning her career in Shell International, UBS Warburg (London), General Electric Company (USA) and Ernst & Young Singapore. Ms Goh’s broad and deep expertise includes financial management, board governance, acquisitions and business integrations, risk management, external audit, business and process transformation.

The Company is of the view that the Board, as a whole, provides core competencies necessary to meet the Group’s requirements, taking into account the nature and scope of the Group’s operations; in particular Mr Denny and Mr Burke, with their backgrounds and experience, bring with them wide perspectives which encourage more effective discussions and better decision-making. In addition, Ms Goh being a chartered accountant and the first female director of the Company further strengthen diversity in the Board.

The Board has achieved its target of appropriate level of diversity of thoughts and backgrounds to enable wider perspectives as set out in its diversity policy. For any appointment to the Board or in any Board renewal where applicable, the NRC will ensure the candidate must be of the right fit, taking into account the relevant strategies and needs of the Group at that time. The NRC will continue to review the Board’s diversity policy to ensure its effectiveness and where applicable, will recommend appropriate revisions to the Board for consideration and approval.

The details of the Directors’ background and experience are set out in the “Board of Directors” section of this Annual Report.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# PROVISION 2.5

# ROLE OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

During the financial year reported on, the Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop both the Group’s short-term and long-term business strategies. Management’s progress and performance in implementing such agreed business strategies are monitored by the Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors communicate among themselves without the presence of the Management as and when the need arises. The Non-Executive Directors provide feedback to the Chairman or the Board as appropriate.

# CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

# Principle 3:

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the board and management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

# PROVISIONS 3.1 AND 3.2

# SEPARATE ROLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CEO

The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company are separate persons. Mr. Richard J Denny, the Chairman is an Independent Director while Mr. Tan Khai Pang is the CEO. This ensures that there is an appropriate balance of power between the Chairman of the Board and the CEO, thereby allowing increased accountability and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.

As Chairman, Mr Richard J Denny’s responsibilities include:

- leading the Board in its role;
- scheduling meetings (with assistance from the Company Secretary) to enable the Board to perform its duties responsibly while not interfering with the flow of the Group’s operations;
- preparing meeting agenda;
- reviewing all if not most Board papers before they are presented to the Board;
- ensuring effective communication with Shareholders;
- promoting corporate governance; and
- adherence to the Listing Rules and other regulatory requirements.

Mr. Richard J Denny, the Independent Director and Chairman, is consulted on the business of the Board and the Board Committees. Whereas Mr Tan Khai Pang as the CEO of the Company is responsible for setting the business strategies and directions for the Group and manages the business operations of the Group. He is assisted by an experienced and qualified team of executive officers of the Company.

The CEO consults with the Board and Board Committees on major issues. There are constant communications among Board members, and no Director represents a considerable concentration of power as any key decision will require the approval from all Directors prior to implementation.

With the positions of Chairman and the CEO filled by different persons, there is a clear separation of roles and responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO. The Chairman and the CEO are not related.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# PROVISION 3.3

# LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

The Company does not have a lead Independent Director as (i) the Chairman is independent and (ii) the Chairman and the CEO of the Company are separate persons. The Chairman, as an Independent Director, together with the other Independent Directors are available to Shareholders where they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of communication with the Management are inappropriate or inadequate.

# BOARD MEMBERSHIP

# Principle 4:

The board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the board.

The Board had merged the Nominating Committee and Remuneration Committee into a new Committee, known as Nominating and Remuneration Committee (“NRC”) in November, which aimed to improve its efficiency and effectiveness in discharging its duties. The scope and responsibilities of NRC are set out in the Term of Reference approved by the Board.

# PROVISIONS 4.1 AND 4.2

# NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The NRC comprises three (3) Independent Directors, namely:

|Mr Wong Ming Ghee, Bernard|(Chairman/Independent Director)|
|---|---|
|Mr Richard J Denny|(Member/ Independent Director)|
|Ms Goh Liang Choo|(Member/Independent Director)|

The role of the NRC as a nominating committee is to make recommendations to the Board on relevant matters relating to:

- (a) the review of the succession plans for Directors, in particular the appointment and/or replacement of the Chairman, the CEO and key management personnel;
- (b) the process and criteria for evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Board Committees and Directors, including the review of the independence of the Independent Directors;
- (c) the review of training and professional development programmes for the Board and its Directors; and
- (d) the appointment and re-appointment of Directors (including alternate Directors, if any).

The NRC will review Board succession plans for Directors, and will seek to refresh the Board membership in an orderly manner where it deems applicable. The NRC will also ensure that the Company has succession planning for its Executive Directors and key management personnel, including the appointment, training and mentoring of successors. The NRC has reviewed contingency arrangements for any unexpected incapacity of the Executive Director or any of key management personnel, and is satisfied with the procedures in place in ensuring the transition to a full operational management team.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# PROVISION 4.3

# PROCESS FOR THE SELECTION, APPOINTMENT AND RE-APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS

The Company has in place policies and procedures for the appointment of new Directors, including the description on the search and nomination process.

The composition of the Board is reviewed on an annual basis by the NRC to ensure that the Board is of the appropriate size and has the mix of expertise and experience, and collectively possess the necessary core competencies for effective functioning and informed decision-making.

Where there is a resignation or retirement of an existing Director, the NRC will re-evaluate the Board composition to assess the competencies for the replacement. The NRC will deliberate and propose to the Board the background, skills, qualification and experience of the candidate it deems appropriate. The factors taken into consideration by the NRC could include among other things, whether the new Director can add to or complement the mix of skills and qualifications in the existing Board; relevance of his or her experience and contributions to the business of the Group; and the depth and breadth he or she could bring to Board discussions. Candidates are sourced through a network of contacts and identified based on the established criteria. Search can be made through relevant institutions such as the Singapore Institute of Directors, professional organisations, business federations or external search consultants. New Directors will be appointed by way of a resolution by the Board or the Shareholders, after the NRC makes the necessary recommendation to the Board.

Article 104 of the Company’s Constitution requires one-third of the Directors to retire at each AGM. Article 105 of the Company’s Constitution requires those Directors to retire to be those longest in office since their last re-election or appointment or those who have been in office for the three years since their last election. Article 108 of the Company’s Constitution requires any director appointed by the Board during the year to retire at the next AGM. Rule 720(5) of the Listing Rules requires all directors to submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election at least once every three years.

Mr Richard J Denny and Mr Paul C Burke are due to retire at the forthcoming AGM pursuant to Regulation 104 of the Company’s Constitution and Rule 720(5) of the Listing Rules. Ms Goh Liang Choo who was appointed as a Non-Executive and Independent Director on 10 November 2022 is due to retire at the forthcoming AGM pursuant to Article 108 of the Company’s Constitution. The NRC has recommended to the Board the re-election of Mr Richard J Denny, Mr Paul C Burke and Ms Goh Liang Choo at the forthcoming AGM. The Board has accepted the NRC’s recommendation.

The information on Mr Richard J Denny, Mr Paul C Burke and Ms Goh Liang Choo as required in Appendix 7.4.1 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST is contained in the Notice of the AGM.

# PROVISION 4.4

# DETERMINING DIRECTORS’ INDEPENDENCE

Each Independent Director completes a checklist to confirm his independence on an annual basis. The NRC has reviewed the independence of the Directors as mentioned under Provision 2.1.

# PROVISION 4.5

# DIRECTORS’ MULTIPLE BOARD REPRESENTATIONS

The NRC ensures that new Directors are aware of their duties and obligations. Each Director signs the undertaking in the form set out in Appendix 7.7 of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST to undertake to use their best endeavours to comply with the Listing Rules and to procure that the Company too shall so comply.

The NRC considers and it is of the view that it would not be appropriate to set a limit on the number of directorships that a Director may hold because directors have different capabilities, and the nature of the organisations in which they hold appointments and the kind of Committees on which they serve are of different complexities. Accordingly, the NRC leaves it to each Director to personally determine the demands of his or her competing directorships and obligations and assess the number of directorships they could hold and serve effectively. The Board concurs with the NRC.

56 ADDVALUE TECHNOLOGIES LTD

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Mr Richard J Denny and Mr Paul C Burke have confirmed that they are able to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group. They do not have any full-time executive commitments in any companies and their experiences are valuable to the Board and the Board Committees. Mr Bernard Wong and Mr Chua Chwee Kok have confirmed that they would be able to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group.

After making all reasonable enquiries and having considered the aforementioned, nothing has come to the attention of the NRC to cause them to doubt that the Non-Executive Directors including Mr Richard J Denny and Mr Paul C Burke would not have the ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group.

Details of the Directors’ principal commitments and outside directorships are set out in the “Board of Directors” section of this Annual Report.

# BOARD PERFORMANCE

# Principle 5:

The board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

# PROVISIONS 5.1 AND 5.2

# CONDUCT OF BOARD PERFORMANCE

The NRC has established a formal evaluation process to assess the effectiveness of individual Directors and of the Board as a whole.

Each year, the Directors are requested to complete appraisal forms to assess the overall effectiveness of the Board and the Board Committees, as well as each individual Director’s contributions to the Board and the Board Committees.

The appraisal of the Board considers the Board composition, maintenance of independence, timeliness and completeness of information provided to the Board, Board process, Board accountability, communication with the Management and standard of conduct. The results of the appraisal exercise are considered by the NRC, which then makes recommendations to the Board with the aim of helping the Board to discharge its duties more effectively. The Directors are assessed on their experience in being a company director, competence and knowledge, the level and quality of involvement during the course of the year, attendance record at meetings of the Board and the Board Committees, intensity of participation at meetings, the quality of interventions and special contributions.

The Board Committees are assessed on the work they perform in accordance with their terms of reference and the objectivity and independence in their deliberations and recommendations they presented to the Board.

For FY2023, the NRC has reviewed each individual Director’s performance during the appraisal exercise and the overall assessment of individual Directors and of the Board and Board Committees as a whole were good, effective and have acted independently in the interest of all shareholders. The NRC has discussed the results with the Board and it is the Board’s endeavour to, where appropriate, further improve and enhance its effectiveness over the Group’s performance, financially or otherwise. The Board is also satisfied that each Director has allocated sufficient time and resources to the affairs of the Group. All NRC members have abstained from the review process in connection with the assessment of his own performance.

The Company does not use any external professional facilitator for the assessments of the Board, Board Committees and individual Directors, and will consider the use of such facilitator as and when appropriate.

# PROVISION 7.1

# REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL

# REMUNERATION REPORT

Details of the remuneration paid or proposed to be paid to the Directors of the Company for the FY2023 are set out below:

|Remuneration Bands|Director|Director’s Fees (%)|Fixed Salary1 (%)|Benefits1 (%)|Share Awards2 (%)|

2. Share Awards refers to the share-based payment pursuant to the Award Shares granted in FY2022 under the Addvalue Technologies Performance Share Plan.

3. Dr Chan Kum Lok, Colin relinquished his appointment as Executive Chairman and Director on 31 March 2023.

4. Ms Goh Liang Choo was appointed as Independent Non-Executive Director on 10 November 2022.

For FY2023 Annual Report, the Board considered the disclosure of Directors’ remuneration in bands of S$250,000 as adequate due to reasons of industry competitiveness, confidentiality and sensitivity of remuneration matters. The Board is of the view that it would be disadvantaged to the Group to detail the remuneration of the Executive Director. The Executive Director, who is non-substantial Shareholders of the Company, is employee of the Group like any of the other key management personnel who are not Directors and whose remuneration are disclosed in bands of S$250,000. The Board is of view that he should not be disadvantaged relative to the other key management personnel of the Group just merely because he is a Director.

While the exact remuneration of the Directors was not given, the level and mix of remuneration of the Directors in percentage terms within remuneration bands of S$250,000 were provided. The Company believes that such a disclosure, taking into account of the reasoning mentioned above, provides Shareholders with an adequate appreciation of the remuneration packages of the Directors and is consistent with the intent of Principle 8 of the Code.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The Company takes cognizance of new listing rules relating to disclosure of remuneration of directors and CEO for annual reports prepared for the financial years ending or after 31 December 2024. The Company will work towards compliance with the new listing rules relating to disclosure of remuneration of directors and CEO.

# Principle 9:

The board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

# PROVISION 9.1

# RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS

The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard Shareholders’ interests and the Group’s assets. The responsibility of overseeing the Company’s risk management framework and policies is undertaken by the AC with the assistance of In.Corp Business Advisory Pte Ltd (“In.Corp”), a third party which the Company has appointed as its internal auditors since November 2019.

The main risks arising from the Group’s business and financial instruments are operational and financial risks. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities. To minimize such risk, the Group has put in place an Enterprise Risk Management Programme (“ERM”). The purpose of this programme was to actively engage senior management on a “hands-on” and proactive approach in managing and supervising the Group’s business, with focus on operational and compliance risks. The Group has also engaged In.Corp since November 2019 as its consultant to assist in this area.

Having considered the Group’s business operations, the existing internal control and risk management systems of the Group and the appointment of In.Corp as its internal auditors, the Board is of the view that a separate risk committee shall be established in 2023. The Risk Committee (“RC”) convened its inaugural meeting on 9 May 2023.

The RC comprises three (3) Independent and Non-executive Directors and the CEO, namely:

|Mr Richard J Denny (Chairman)|Independent Non-executive Director|
|---|---|
|Mr Wong Ming Ghee, Bernard (Member)|Independent Non-executive Director|
|Ms Goh Liang Choo (Member)|Independent Non-executive Director|
|Mr Tan Khai Pang (Member)|CEO|

The quorum necessary for the Committee shall be two members. A duly convened meeting of the Committee at which a quorum is present shall be competent to exercise all or any of the authorities, powers and discretions vested in or exercisable by the Committee.

The RC carried out its duties in accordance with the terms of reference. The Committee shall review the Group’s strategy, policies, framework, processes and procedures for the identification, measurement, reporting and mitigation of material risks in the Group’s business, with due consideration to applicable laws and regulations, as appropriate, and report any significant matters, findings and recommendations in this regard to the Board.

The Independent and Non-Executive Directors believe that the RC benefits and will continue to benefit from the inputs of Mr Tan Khai Pang who is the CEO, in carrying out its functions effectively.

The AC and RC reviewed the internal audit reports provided by In.Corp and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system in the light of key business and financial risks affecting its business.

# PROVISION 9.2

# ASSURANCES FROM THE CEO AND FINANCIAL CONTROLLER

For FY2023, the Board has received assurance from the CEO and Financial Controller of the Company in the execution of their respective duties as CEO and Financial Controller and to the best of their knowledge and belief that the financial records of the Group have been properly maintained; the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s operations and finances; and the Group’s risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective.

# BOARD’S COMMENT ON ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS

Based on the work performed by the external and internal auditors, the system of risk management and internal controls established and maintained by the Group, the assurances from the CEO and Financial Controller of the Company, the reviews performed by the Management, the various Board Committees and the Board, pursuant to Rule 1207 (10) of the Listing Rules, the Board is of the opinion that the Group’s internal controls, including operation, financial, compliance, information technology controls and risk management system, are adequate and effective as at the date of this Annual Report. The AC concurs with the Board’s opinion based on their reviews of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems.

The Board recognises that the system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and that no systems of internal controls or risk management can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of errors, poor judgment in decision making, losses, frauds or other irregularities. It can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss or that the Group will not be adversely affected by any event that can be reasonably foreseen.

# AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE

- the scope, adequacy, effectiveness, independence and the results of internal audit functions and audit procedures with the Company’s internal auditors;
- the adequacy, effectiveness, independence and scope of the audit plan of the Company’s external auditors and its report on the weaknesses of internal accounting controls arising from the statutory audit;
- the assistance given by the Management to the internal and external auditors;
- the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s internal control and risk management systems at least on an annual basis;
- the assurance from the CEO and the Financial Controller on the proper upkeep of financial records and financial statements;
- the significant financial reporting issues and judgments so as to ensure the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and the disclosures thereof in relation to the periodic results announcements of the Group prior to their submission to the Board for approval;

The AC has full access to the Management and is given the resources required for it to discharge its functions. The AC has authority to investigate any matter within its terms of reference and discretion to invite any Director or executive officer of the Group (the “Executive Officer”) to attend its meetings.

The AC also reviewed the key audit matters (“KAM”) set out in the auditor’s report for FY2023. The AC had discussed and noted, together with the external auditors and the Management, on the approach and methodology applied by the external auditors in relation to the assessment of judgments and estimates on the significant matters reported in the KAM.

The Company confirms that it has complied with Rules 712 and 715 of the Listing Rules in engaging Mazars LLP, an accounting firm registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore, as the external auditors of the Company and its Singapore subsidiaries. Mazars LLP have audited the Group’s significant foreign subsidiaries for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

With Amba Partners CPA Limited appointed as the external auditors of the Company’s subsidiary incorporated in Hong Kong, and Beijing An Zheng CPA Co., Ltd as the external auditors of the Company’s subsidiary incorporated in the People’s Republic of China, the Board and the AC are satisfied that the appointment of different auditors would not compromise the standard and the effectiveness of the audit of the Group and that Rule 716 of the Listing Rules has been complied with.

# Independence of external auditors

The AC reviews the independence of the external auditors annually. It reviewed the amount of non-audit services rendered to the Group by the external auditors and was satisfied that the nature and extent of such services will not prejudice the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. The aggregate fees paid to the Group’s external auditor Mazars LLP, for FY2023 were $120,000 (FY2022: $113,500), with no non-audit services provided in FY2023 (FY2022: S$3,500 or 3.7% of the total fees paid). Being satisfied that the nature and extent of such services will not prejudice the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, the AC recommended to the Board that Mazars LLP be nominated for re-appointment as the external auditors of the Group’s companies in Singapore at the forthcoming AGM at remuneration to be re-negotiated.

# Whistle-blowing Policy

The Company has in place a whistle-blowing framework for staff to raise concerns about improprieties. The policy serves to encourage and provide a channel to employees to report in good faith and in confidence, without fear of reprisals, concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other matters. The objective of such an arrangement is to ensure independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action.

The AC is responsible for oversight and monitoring of any whistle-blowing matters and the findings will be reported to the Board. The AC will ensure that those procedures are conducted by persons who are independent of the complaint.

All whistle-blowing reports will be handled confidentially, except as necessary or appropriate to conduct investigation and to take remedial action, in accordance with the applicable law and regulations. In this regard, the identity of the whistle-blower making the allegation will be kept confidential and confined to disclosures on a need-to-know basis to the AC, the investigating team, the Board of Directors of the Company; and any party to whom the identity of the whistle-blower is required to be disclosed by law.

The Company will not tolerate the harassment or victimisation of anyone reporting a genuine concern. If the whistle-blower has suffered adverse treatment, harassment or victimisation as a result of his or her disclosure, he or she should submit a formal complaint to the Human Resource Department or higher authority as appropriate. An investigation may take place and disciplinary action may be taken against any person who harasses or victimises the whistle-blower or subject the whistle-blower to detrimental or unfair treatment.

There were no reports of whistle-blowing received in FY2023.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of Addvalue Technologies Ltd

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Addvalue Technologies Ltd (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 March 2023, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Group for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 March 2023 and of the financial performance, changes in equity and cash flows of the Group for the financial year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (the “ACRA code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Overview

# Audit Approach

We designed a risk-based audit approach in identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement at both the financial statement and assertion levels.

# Materiality

As in all our audits, we exercised our professional judgment in determining our materiality, which was also affected by our perception of the financial information needs of the users of the financial statements, being the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable for a reasonably knowledgeable person to change or be influenced in his economic decision.

# Scope of audit

For the audit of the current financial year’s financial statements, we identified 5 significant components which required a full scope audit of their financial information, either because of their size or/and their risk characteristics.

Out of the 5 significant components, 4 components were audited by us, and a component was audited by other Mazars office as component auditors under our instructions. We determined the component materiality and our level of involvement in their audit necessary for us, in our professional judgment, to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the Group’s financial statements as a whole.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023  77

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of Addvalue Technologies Ltd

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Area of focus

We focused our resources and effort on areas which were assessed to have higher risks of material misstatement, including areas which involve significant judgments and estimates to be made by directors.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

|Matters|Audit response|
|---|---|
|Going concern|Refer to Note 3.1 for the critical judgment made in applying the Group’s accounting policies for disclosures relating to the going concern.|

The Group incurred net loss of US$2,992,497 and generated net operating cash outflows of US$2,733,906 during the financial year ended 31 March 2023 and only reported cash and bank balances of US$151,289 as of 31 March 2023. These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Notwithstanding the above conditions, management assessed and concluded that there is no material uncertainty relating to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern on the following premises:

- Subsequent to 31 March 2023, the Group has successfully obtained short-term borrowings from various parties amounted to S$1,016,000 (approximately US$742,000);
- The Group would be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows; and
- The Group would be able to fulfil its obligations towards its creditors as and when such obligations fall due.

The assessment of the appropriateness of the Group’s going concern assumption requires significant management judgment and estimates, including the management’s assessment of the feasibility of their plans in arriving at the projections of the future cash flows of the Group.

Our audit procedures include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Obtained an understanding of and evaluated the feasibility of the management’s plans for future action in relation to their going concern assessment, whether the outcome of the plans is likely to improve the situation and the feasibility of such plans in the circumstances;
- Performed an analysis of the cash flow projections prepared by management, which included our evaluation of the reliability and relevance of the underlying data used to prepare the forecast and the reasonableness and appropriateness of the assumptions used.

We also considered the appropriateness and adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements in respect to the management’s assessment of the appropriateness of the use of going concern assumption in their preparation of the Group’s financial statements.

# Key Audit Matters (Continued)

|Matters|Audit response|
|---|---|
|Impairment assessment of development expenditure|Refer to Note 3.2 for the relevant key sources of estimation uncertainty and Note 15 (Intangible Assets) for the disclosures relating to the impairment assessment. The Group develops and manufactures a range of terminals operating on major satellite networks for land, maritime, aeronautical applications and space resilient technologies. As at 31 March 2023, the carrying value of development expenditure amounted to US$7,926,397 (2022: US$8,585,089), which represented 48% (2022: 58%) of the Group’s total assets. In accordance with SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets, an entity assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the development expenditure may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the management shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an entity shall also test the development expenditure not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. For the purpose of impairment assessment, development expenditure has been allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) as follows: • Assessed independence and competence of management’s expert (external valuer) for impairment assessment of intangible assets; • Involved both in-house and external valuation expert on the assessment of value-in-use model; • Performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions where we adjusted the discount rates, sales forecast, and growth rates in revenue and cost of sales for those key assumptions that are most sensitive to the valuation models; • Satellite communication (“Satcom”); • Internet-of-Things (“IoT”); • Advance Digital Radio Solutions (“ADRS”); and • Space Connectivity (”SPC”). Management assessed discounted cash flow derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors and estimated the probable future economic benefits from the identified CGUs that are expected to be generated by the development expenditure developed by the Group. The estimates of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs in which development expenditure attributable to, are determined based on value-in-use calculations. Discounted cash flow projections used in the calculation are based on the approved financial budgets, discount rate and growth rates in revenue and cost of sales, for which the judgments applied and estimates used are subjected to significant judgment and estimates of the management.|

# Key Audit Matters (Continued)

|Matters|Audit response|
|---|---|
|Provision for inventories obsolescence|Refer to Note 3.2 for the relevant key sources of estimation uncertainty relating to inventories valuation method. As at 31 March 2023, the Group’s inventories are US$4,898,776 (2022: US$2,850,875), representing 30% (2022: 19%) of the Group’s total assets. With reference to SFRS(I) 2 Inventories, inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (“NRV”). Management reviews the Group’s inventories levels to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventories. The assessment of the provision for inventories obsolescence requires the use of significant judgment and estimates. Based on the Group policies, the allowance for inventories obsolescence will be provided if the inventories are aged more than 3 years. Management’s allowance for inventories obsolescence is subjective and influenced by estimates concerning the level of sales activity. In consideration of the significance of the balance and significant estimates and judgment applied by management, we consider this as a key audit matter. Our audit procedures included, and were not limited to, the following: • Understood the inventory costing policy on making allowance for inventory obsolescence of the Group; • Reviewed the inventory aging process and management’s assessment on potential stock obsolescence; • Performed test of details to verify the accuracy and appropriate application of the costing method; and • Reviewed management’s assessment of the estimation of NRV of inventories as at 31 March 2023 to determine whether the inventories are measured at lower of cost and NRV. We also considered the appropriateness of the disclosures in respect of allowance for inventories obsolescence presented in the financial statements.|

# Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and the independent auditors’ report thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Members of Addvalue Technologies Ltd

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

# Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: (Continued)

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiaries incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Tan Chee Tyan.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

These notes form an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.

# 1. GENERAL

Addvalue Technologies Ltd (the “Company”) (Registration Number 199603037H) is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Singapore and listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). The registered office and principal place of business of the Company is located at 202 Bedok South Avenue 1 #01-11 Singapore 469332.

The principal activity of the Company is that of investment holding.

The principal activities of its subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements.

The financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on the date of directors’ statement.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 2.1 Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company have been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) including related Interpretations of SFRS(I) (“SFRS(I) INT”) and are prepared on the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.

The individual financial statements of each Group entity are measured and presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are presented in United States dollar (“US$”) which is also the functional currency of the Company.

In the current year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised SFRS(I)s and SFRS(I) INT that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2022. With the exception of the amendments made to SFRS(I) 1-37 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (“SFRS(I) 1-37”), the adoption of these new or revised SFRS(I)s and SFRS(I) INT did not result in changes to the Group’s and Company’s accounting policies, and has no material effect on the current or prior year’s financial statement and is not expected to have a material effect on future periods.

The adoption of SFRS(I) 1-37 from 1 January 2022 resulted in a change in accounting policy in the assessment of onerous contracts. Before the amendment, the Group only included incremental costs to fulfil a contract when determining whether a contract is onerous. With the amendment, the Group includes both the incremental costs and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts when determining whether a contract is onerous.

The amendments are applied on a retrospective basis on contracts for which the Group has not yet fulfilled all its obligations on 1 January 2022. Based on the Group’s assessment, there is no onerous contract identified with the revision of the accounting policy.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.1 Basis of preparation (Continued)

SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT issued but not yet effective

At the date of authorisation of these statements, the following SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT that are relevant to the Group were issued but not yet effective:

|SFRS (I)|Title|Effective date (annual periods beginning on or after)|
|---|---|---|
|SFRS(I) 1-1|Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current|1 January 2024|

|Various|Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1: Non-current Liabilities with Covenants|1 January 2024|

Consequential amendments were also made to various standards as a result of these new/revised standards.

The Group does not intend to early adopt any of the above new/revised standards, interpretations and amendments to the existing standards. Other than the following standards, management anticipates that the adoption of the aforementioned revised/new standards will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and Company in the period of their initial adoption.

# 2.2 Basis of consolidation

The financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) (i) over which the Group has power and the Group is (ii) able to use such power to (iii) affect its exposure, or rights, to variable returns from then through its involvement with them.

The Group reassesses whether it controls the subsidiaries if facts and circumstance indicate that there are changes to the one or more of the three elements of control.

When the Group has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it still has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances, to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group considers, among others, the extent of its voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders, currently exercisable substantive potential voting rights held by all parties, rights arising from contractual arrangements and voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023 89

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.2 Basis of consolidation (Continued)

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group up to the effective date on which control ceases, as appropriate.

Intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cashflows relating to intragroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as that of the Company. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Non-controlling interests are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, non-controlling interests may be initially measured either at fair value or at their proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Losses in the subsidiary are attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any differences between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in the relative interests in the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to accumulated profits) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investments retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.

Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss that has been recognised in profit or loss in the Company’s separate financial statements.

# 2.3 Business combinations

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets constitute a business. When determining the acquired set of activities and assets constitute a business, the Group assesses whether the acquired set of activities and assets includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process, which together contribute to the creation of outputs.

The Group has the option to apply a “concentration test” as a simplified assessment to determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The Group makes the election separately for each transaction or other event. The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.3 Business combinations (Continued)

The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group determines whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred and included in administrative expenses.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations (“SFRS(I) 3”) are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with SFRS(I) 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (“SFRS(I) 5”), which are recognised and measured at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell.

The Group recognises any contingent consideration to be transferred for the acquiree at the fair value on the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement shall be accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments (“SFRS(I) 9”), is measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss in accordance with SFRS(I) 9. Other contingent consideration that is not within the scope of SFRS(I) 9 is measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under SFRS(I) 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:

- deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes and SFRS(I) 1-19 Employee Benefits respectively;
- liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with SFRS(I) 2 Share-based Payment; and
- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with SFRS(I) 5 are measured in accordance with that Standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023  91

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.3 Business combinations (Continued)

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.

Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset at the acquisition date and is initially measured at cost, being
the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and
the fair value of the acquirer previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over net acquisition-date fair value
amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the
sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of
the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or
loss as a bargain purchase gain.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected
to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit (including the goodwill),
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to
the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

The attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of gain or loss on disposal of the subsidiary or
jointly controlled entity.

# 2.4 Revenue recognition

Revenue from contracts with its customers is recognised when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation by
transferring a promised goods or service generated in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities to its customer, at a
transaction price that reflects the consideration the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or service
and that is allocated to that performance obligation. The goods or service is transferred when or as the customer
obtains control of the goods or service.

Sale of goods

The Group sells a range of tele-communication and satellite communication equipment to its customers. Revenue is
recognised at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the end customers (i.e. when the goods are
delivered in accordance with the applicable incoterms or/and terms and conditions and significant risks and rewards
of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customer). A corresponding receivable is recognised for the
consideration that is unconditional when only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract on the basis of the relative stand-
alone selling prices of the promised goods.

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.4 Revenue recognition (Continued)

# Contract design revenue

The Group enters into contracts with customers for design and customisation of terminal system and feasibility study on integration of systems design. Revenue from the contract design revenue is recognised over time, using the output method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the service, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. In the application of the output method, the Group has used appraisals of results achieved method. Accordingly, in view of the nature of the contract design revenue, management considers that this output method is most appropriate in measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“SFRS(I) 15”).

The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of the promised services.

# Design service income

Design service relates to testing services on products sold and firmware upgrade to customers. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the services are completed. A corresponding receivable is recognised for the consideration that is unconditional when only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of the promised services.

# Licensing income

The Group grants right-of-use (on a non-exclusive, perpetual and global basis) of the Group’s in-house developed intellectual properties (“IPs”) to customers in facilitating the customer to integrate the IPs into its own telecommunication products to be developed and manufactured in conjunction with its space-based global managed network. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the right to use the Group’s intellectual properties is granted. A corresponding receivable is recognised for the consideration that is unconditional when only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of the promised services.

# Warranty obligations

The Group provides a two-year assurance-type warranty for the sale of goods. These warranties are accounted for under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (“SFRS(I) 1-37”) (see Note 24).

# Financing components

The Group does not extend credit terms beyond one year and does not expect, at contract inception, that the period between when the Group transfers a promised goods or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that goods or service to be beyond one year. Accordingly, the Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing components.

ANNUAL REPORT 2023  93

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.5 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Borrowing costs on general borrowings are capitalised by applying a capitalisation rate to construction or development expenditures that are financed by general borrowings. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

# 2.6 Retirement benefits costs

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes, such as the Singapore Central Provident Fund, are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.

The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are required to provide staff pension benefits to their employees under existing PRC legislation. These subsidiaries are required to contribute a certain percentage of their payroll costs to the pension scheme to fund the benefits. The pension funds are managed by government agencies, which are responsible for paying pensions to the retired employees. Contributions under the pension scheme are charged to the profit or loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the pension scheme.

# 2.7 Employee leave entitlement

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the financial year.

# 2.8 Share-based payments

Employee performance share plan allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value of shares is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured based on the market value at grant date and spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares. At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares under options that are expected to become exercisable on the vesting date and recognises the impact of the revision of the estimates in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to the share option reserve over the remaining vesting period.

# 2.9 Income tax

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or tax deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end of the financial year.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.9 Income tax (Continued)

Deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

A deferred income tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the financial year and based on the tax consequence that will follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the financial year, to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities except for the investment properties where investment properties measured at fair value are presented to be recovered entirely through sale.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also recognised directly in equity, or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill or determining the excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost.

Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

- when the sales tax that is incurred on purchases is not recoverable from the tax authorities, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and
- receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

The Group’s sales of goods in the PRC are subjected to Value-added Tax (“VAT”) at the applicable tax rate of 13% for PRC domestic sales. Input tax on purchases can be deducted from output VAT. The net amount of VAT recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of “other receivables” or “other payables” in the statement of financial position. The Group’s export sales are not subject to VAT.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.10 Foreign currency transactions and translation

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the individual entities’ respective functional currencies at the exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each financial year, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing as of the end of the financial year. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the year except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity through other comprehensive income.

Exchange differences relating to assets under construction for future productive use, are included in the cost of those assets where they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations (including comparatives) are expressed in United States dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the financial year. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed off.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to the foreign currency translation reserve.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

# 2.11 Property, plant and equipment

Buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are shown at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation, and where applicable, accumulated impairment losses.

Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The cost of plant and equipment includes its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Dismantlement, removal or restoration costs are included as part of the cost of plant and equipment if the obligation for dismantlement, removal or restoration is incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the plant and equipment.

Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment is added to the carrying amount of the asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.11 Property, plant and equipment (Continued)

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

|Leasehold buildings (over the lease term)|3|
|---|---|
|Laboratory equipment|5|
|Furniture, fittings and office equipment|3 - 10|
|Computers and software|2 - 5|
|Toolings|3|
|Renovations|6|

For right-of-use assets for which ownership of the underlying asset is not transferred to the Group by the end of the lease term, depreciation is charged over the lease term, using the straight-line method. The lease periods are disclosed in Note 29.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at the end of each financial year.

The gain or loss, being the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in profit or loss. Any amount in the revaluation reserve relating to that asset is transferred to accumulated profits directly.

Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use.

# 2.12 Intangible assets

Acquired intangible assets

Acquired intangible assets are measured initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Acquired intangible assets have either finite or indefinite useful life.

Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortised over its useful life, using its straight-line method.

The amortisation charge is recognised in profit or loss and is assessed for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated amortisation period and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at the end of each financial year.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.12 Intangible assets (Continued)

Intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not amortised, but tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The indefinite useful life of an intangible asset is reviewed at the end of each financial year and where events and circumstances do not continue to support the indefinite useful life assessment for that asset, a change from indefinite to finite useful life is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and adjusted prospectively.

The intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal, with any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset, being the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, recognised in profit or loss.

# Internally generated intangible assets

Expenditure from the research phase of an internal project to create an intangible asset is expensed in profit or loss when it is incurred. Where the research phase cannot be distinguished from the development phase of an internal project, the Group treats the expenditure on that project as if it were incurred in the research phase only.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised, if, and only if, all the following have been demonstrated:

- the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;
- the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;
- the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;
- how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;
- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible assets; and
- the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is charged to profit or loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

The amortisation charge is recognised in profit or loss and is assessed for impairment when there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The estimated amortisation period and amortisation methods are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at the end of each financial year.

# (i) Development expenditure

Internally generated development expenditure are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. Amortisation is charged to the profit or loss on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 10 years.

# (iii) Computer software

Separately acquired computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. Amortisation is charged to the profit or loss on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 5 years.

# 2.13 Investments in associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, being the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not of control or of joint control of those policies, and generally accompanying a shareholding of 20% or more of the voting power.

On acquisition of the associate, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the associate identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the Group’s share of the associate’s profit or loss in the reporting period in which the investment is acquired. Investments in associates are carried at cost less any impairment loss that has been recognised in profit or loss in the Company’s separate financial statements.

The results and assets and liabilities of an associate are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held-for-sale, in which case it is accounted for under SFRS(I) 5 from the date on which the investee become held-for-sale. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment loss of individual investments. The Group’s share of losses in an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate) are not recognised, unless the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Distributions received from the associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group’s interest in an associate is accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for goodwill arising on such acquisitions (see above).

Unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses are also eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no impairment.

The Company has accounted for its investments in associates at cost in its separate financial statements.

# 2.14 Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets as at each reporting date to assess for any indication of impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, the Group also tests its intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use for impairment annually by comparing their respective carrying amounts with their corresponding recoverable amounts.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

An impairment loss for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

# 2.15 Financial instruments

The Group recognises a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

# Financial assets

# Initial recognition and measurement

With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company applies a practical expedient, all financial assets are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value. Such trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company applies a practical expedient are measured at transaction price as defined in SFRS(I) 15 in Note 2.4.

The classification of the financial assets at initial recognition as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) and fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) depends on the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.15 Financial instruments (Continued)

# Financial assets (Continued)

# Initial recognition and measurement (Continued)

The Group’s business model refers to how the Group manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows which determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling financial assets or both.

The Group determines whether the asset’s contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (“SPPI”) on the principal amount outstanding to determine the classification of the financial assets.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the financial asset at amortised cost are measured using the effective interest method and is subject to impairment. Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.

# Effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial instrument. Income and expense are recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than those financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.

Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at effective interest rate applicable.

# Financial assets at FVTPL

A financial asset is subsequently measured at FVTPL if the financial asset is a financial asset held for trading, is not measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI, or is irrevocably elected at initial recognition to be designated FVTPL if, by designating the financial asset as FVTPL, eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.

Gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss.

# Financial assets (Continued)

# Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets measured at amortised cost. At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition by assessing the change in the risk of a default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument. Where the financial asset is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

The Group uses reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort as well as past due information when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Where the credit risk on that financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to the lifetime ECL. Where the credit risk on that financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.

The Group applies the simplified approach to recognise the ECL for trade receivables and contract assets, which is to measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. As a practical expedient, the Group uses an allowance matrix derived based on historical credit loss experience adjusted for current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions for measuring ECL.

While they are not financial assets, contract assets arising from the Group’s contracts with customers under SFRS(I) 15 are assessed for impairment in accordance with SFRS(I) 9, similar to that of trade receivables.

The amount of ECL or reversal thereof that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recognised is recognised in profit or loss.

The Group directly reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when the entity has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof.

For details on the Group’s accounting policy for its impairment of financial assets, refer to Note 39.

# Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds receivables.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.15 Financial instruments (Continued)

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments

# Classification as debt or equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

# Equity instruments

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

# Ordinary share capital

Ordinary share capital is classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.

# Convertible loan notes

Convertible loan notes are treated as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component. The component parts of compound instruments are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.

The liability component of bonds is recognised initially at the fair value of a similar non-convertible liability. The carrying amount of the equity component is then determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole.

Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity portion in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

Subsequent to the initial measurement, the liability component of the bonds is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method until its extinguishment upon conversion, redemption or at the maturity date. The equity component remains as equity, net of income tax effects, but may be transferred within equity.

# Financial liabilities

# Initial recognition and measurement

All financial liabilities are recognised on trade date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, minus transaction costs, except for those financial liabilities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.

Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities.

Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss if the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial liabilities classified as at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting.

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments (Continued)

# Financial liabilities (Continued)

# Redeemable convertible bonds

Redeemable convertible bonds are treated as hybrid instruments, consisting of a liability component and embedded derivative component(s). The bonds are designated as financial instrument that is carried at fair value through profit or loss in its entirety and therefore the embedded derivative are not recognised separately.

The bonds are recognised initially at the fair value which is based on the issuance proceeds. Subsequently, the bonds are carried at fair value with fair value changes being recognised in profit or loss on each reporting date.

# Other financial liabilities

# Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, where applicable, using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss when the liability is derecognised and through the amortisation process.

# Borrowings

Interest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for borrowing costs (see Note 2.5 above). A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss when the liability is derecognised and through the amortisation process.

# Financial guarantee contracts

The Company has issued corporate guarantees to banks and other financial institutions for facilities granted by them to certain subsidiaries and these guarantees qualify as financial guarantees because the Company is required to reimburse the banks and other financial institutions if these subsidiaries breach any repayment terms.

Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values plus transaction costs and subsequently at the higher of the amount of the loss allowance and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation in accordance with SFRS(I) 15.

# Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.16 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials comprise purchase costs accounted for on a weighted average basis. Work-in-progress and finished goods comprise cost of direct materials, direct labour and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity. These costs are assigned on a first-in first-out basis.

When necessary, allowance is provided for damage, obsolete and slow-moving items to adjust the carrying value of inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

# 2.17 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

# 2.18 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assessed whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Where a contract contains more than one lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component. Where the contract contains non-lease components, the Group applied the practical expedient to not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease components as a single lease component.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date for all lease arrangement for which the Group is the lessee, except for leases which have lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets for which the Group applied the recognition exemption allowed under SFRS(I) 16. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payment as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located. For right-of-use assets relates to property, plant and equipment to which the Group applies the revaluation model, the Group elected not to apply the revaluation model to all of the right-of-use assets that relate to that class of property, plant and equipment.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. When the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. The right-of-use asset is also reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability, where applicable.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.18 Leases (Continued)

Right-of-use assets are presented within “property, plant and equipment”.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate.

The Group generally uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group obtains a reference rate and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and the asset leased.

The lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable,
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date,
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee,
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, and
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to terminate early and lease payments for an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The Group remeasures the lease liability when there is a change in the lease term due to a change in assessment of whether it will exercise a termination or extension or purchase option or due to a change in future lease payment resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payment.

Where there is a remeasurement of the lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset or in profit or loss where there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability and the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero.

# 2.19 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the financial year, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows, which is discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received, and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 2.19 Provisions (Continued)

Changes in the estimated timing or amount of the expenditure or discount rate are recognised in profit or loss as they arise.

A provision is recognised for onerous contracts when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it and is measured at the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any expected cost of terminating it. In determining the cost of fulfilling the contract, the Group includes both the incremental costs and an allocation of others costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. Before a separate provision for an onerous contract is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract.

# Warranty provisions

Provisions for warranty related costs are recognised when the product is sold or services provided. Initial recognition is based on historical experience. The initial estimate of warranty related costs is revised annually.

# 2.20 Government grants

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. Where the grant relates to an expense, the grant is recognised as income in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate, is expensed. Where the grant relates to an asset, the grant is recognised as deferred capital grant on the statement of financial position and is amortised to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalment.

# 2.21 Contingencies

A contingent liability is:

(i) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or

(ii) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

(a) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or

(b) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingencies are not recognised on the statement of financial position of the Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair value can be reliably determined.

# 2.22 Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the group of executive directors and the chief executive officer who makes strategic decisions.

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

The Group made judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that
were not readily apparent from other sources in the application of the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates and
judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from the estimates.

# 3.1 Critical judgments made in applying the Group’s accounting policies

# Determination of functional currency

The Group translates foreign currency items into the respective functional currencies of the Company and its
subsidiaries. In determining the functional currencies of the respective entities, judgment is used by the Group to
determine the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective entities operate. Consideration
factors include the currency that mainly influences sales prices of goods and services and the currency of the country
whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determines the sales prices of its goods and services.

# Capitalisation of development expenditure

The Group follows the guidance of SFRS(I) 1-38 Intangible Assets (“SFRS(I) 1-38”) in determining the amount and
nature of development expenditure to be capitalised as development costs. This determination requires significant
judgment. The Group assesses, among other factors, if the product or process is technically feasible and if the Group
has sufficient technical, financial and other resources to use or market the product or process. In addition, the Group
also applies its judgment to assess the probability of expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the
use of this capitalised development expenditure that will flow to the Group.

# Going concern

The Group incurred net loss of US$2,992,497 and generated net operating cash outflows of US$2,733,906 during the
financial year ended 31 March 2023 and only reported cash and bank balances of US$151,289 as of 31 March 2023.
These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern.

Notwithstanding the above conditions, management assessed and concluded that there is no material uncertainty
relating to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern on the following premises:

- Subsequent to 31 March 2023, the Group has successfully obtained short-term borrowings from various parties
amounted to S$1,016,000 (approximately) US$742,000;
- The Group would be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows; and
- The Group would be able to fulfil its obligations towards its creditors as and when such obligations fall due.

The assessment of the appropriateness of the Group’s going concern assumption requires significant management
judgment and estimates, including the management’s assessment of the feasibility of their plans in arriving at the
projections of the future cash flows of the Group.

# 3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

# Impairment assessment of development expenditure

The Group determines whether there is any indication development expenditure may be impaired at least on an annual basis. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, the Group also performed impairment assessment annually for development expenditure not yet available for use by comparing its carrying value with its recoverable amount. This requires an estimation of the probable future economic benefits that are expected to be generated by the commercial exploitation of products, applications and processes that are developed by the Group. The discounted cash flows are derived from the budget prepared by the management and approved by the Board of Directors and do not include restructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the cash generating unit being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to sales quantities forecasted for the existing and new products and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes.

In preparing the budgets, management also assumed competitive but stable market conditions and continued acceptability of products sold except that the management expects certain products to phase out in next few years.

The Group has carried out a review of products’ life cycle and determined that certain products have reached saturation point and will be phased out in next few years. As a result, the Group has made an impairment loss of US$600,000 (2022: US$600,000) in respect of its development expenditure as at 31 March 2023. The carrying value of the Group’s development expenditure as at 31 March 2023 is US$7,926,397 (2022: US$8,585,089). Further details of the key assumptions applied in the impairment assessment of development expenditure are disclosed in Note 15.

# Inventory valuation method

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Management reviews the Group’s inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving and obsolete inventory and identifies items of inventory which have a market price, being the selling price quoted from the market of similar items, that is lower than its carrying amount. Management then estimates the amount of inventory loss as an allowance on inventory. Changes in demand levels, technological developments and pricing competition could affect the saleability and values of the inventory which could then consequentially impact the Group’s results, cash flows and financial position. The carrying amount of the Group’s inventories as at 31 March 2023 was US$4,898,776 (2022: US$2,850,875) (Note 16).

# Measurement of ECL of trade receivables

The Group assesses its trade receivables on an individual basis for any expected credit loss by considering all reasonable and supportable information, such as past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions of each debtor. The expected loss allowance on the Group’s trade receivables as at 31 March 2023 is US$6,000,000 (2022: US$6,000,000) (Note 39).

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

# 3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)

# Impairment of investments in subsidiaries

At the end of each financial year, an assessment is made on whether there are indicators that the Group’s and the Company’s investments are impaired. Where necessary, the Group’s and Company’s assessments are based on the estimation of the value-in-use of the assets defined in SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets (“SFRS(I)1-36”) by forecasting the expected future cash flows for a period of up to 5 years, using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In determining the value-in-use, the Company has considered the expected and estimated impact of COVID-19 on the key inputs, including the discount rate and growth rate, as well as key assumptions applied. The Company’s carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries as at 31 March 2023 was US$19,085,001 (2022: US$19,549,001) (Note 13).

# Useful lives of development expenditure

The cost of development expenditure is amortised on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives to be 10 years. Changes in the expected useful lives or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Therefore, future amortisation charges could be revised. The carrying amount of the Group’s development expenditure included as intangible assets as at 31 March 2023 was US$7,926,397 (2022: US$8,585,089) (Note 15).

# Depreciation of property, plant and equipment

The Group depreciates the property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives after taking into account of their estimated residual values. The estimated useful life reflects management’s estimate of the period that the Group intends to derive future economic benefits from the use of the Group’s property, plant and equipment. The residual value reflects management’s estimated amount that the Group would currently obtain from the disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, as if the asset was already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological developments could affect the economics, useful lives and the residual values of these assets which could then consequentially impact future depreciation charges. The carrying amount of the Group’s property, plant and equipment at 31 March 2023 was US$550,469 (2022: US$472,590) (Note 12).

# Fair value of redeemable convertible bonds

Redeemable convertible bonds (the “bonds”) are measured at fair value at initial recognition and designated to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the measurement date. In respect of the fair values of entire bonds, the market rate of interest is determined with reference to similar bonds that do not have a conversion option. The carrying amount of the Group’s bonds as at 31 March 2023 was US$3,560,764 (2022: US$Nil) (Note 28).

# 10. LOSS PER SHARE

Basic and diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the year attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year. The following tables reflect the loss and share data used in the computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the financial years ended 31 March:

| |2023|2022|
|---|---|---|
|Loss for the purpose of calculating basic and diluted loss per share (loss for the year attributable to the Company) (US$)|(2,992,497)|(7,963,339)|
|Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of calculating basic and diluted loss per share|3,101,178,165|2,312,809,783|
|Basic and diluted loss per share (US$ cents)|(0.10)|(0.34)|

The basic and diluted loss per share is the same as the instruments were potentially anti-dilutive.

There were no potential dilutive ordinary shares of redeemable convertible bonds. Therefore, no shares were assumed to have been issued on the deemed exercise of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible bonds during the year ended 31 March 2023. Accordingly, the diluted loss per share for financial year ended 31 March 2023 and 2022 was the same as the basic loss per share.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares for financial year ended 31 March 2023 was computed based on the issue and allotment of 717,430,117 (2022: 275,790,000) new ordinary shares as disclosed in Note 32.

During the financial year, the Company invested additional capital of US$7,536,000 in one of its subsidiaries, Addvalue Innovation Pte Ltd, by way of capitalising the amount receivable from Addvalue Innovation Pte Ltd.

The recoverable amount of investment in a subsidiary was determined based on the estimation of the value-in-use of the CGU by forecasting the expected future cash flows for a period up to 10 years, using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The Company had recognised impairment of US$8,000,000 for the investment in Addvalue Innovation Pte Ltd during the financial year as the subsidiary has been persistently making losses and hence recoverable amount calculated as present values of estimated cash flows discounted using a discount rate of 20.1% is lower than the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiary.

# Impairment losses of development expenditure

For the purpose of impairment testing, development expenditure has been allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) as follows:

|Group|2023|2022|
|---|---|---|
|Internet-of-Things (“IoT”)|–|–|
|Satellite communication (“Satcom”)|113,381|828,774|
|Advance Digital Radio Solutions (“ADRS”)|724,419|672,854|
|Space Connectivity (”SPC”)|7,088,597|7,083,461|

Total: 7,926,397 (2022: 8,585,089)

The recoverable amounts of the remaining CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2023

# 15. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

# Impairment losses of development expenditure (Continued)

The calculations of value in use for the CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

| |Advance Digital|Advance Digital|Space|Space|
|---|---|---|
| |Satcom|Internet-of-Things|Radio Solutions|Connectivity|
|2023|-38% to 19%|0% to 35%|-2% to 169%|0% to 90%|
|2022|-26% to 12%|9% to 120%|0% to 359%|10% to 237%|
|Discount rate(2)|20.1%|20.1%|20.1%|20.1%|
| |20.3%|20.3%|20.3%|20.3%|
|Cash flow projections (years)|10|10|10|10|

(1) Annual growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows are based on past performance and the market development adjusted for the specific circumstances of the CGU and based on management’s experience.

(2) The discount rate applied is based on the weighted average cost of the Group’s capital (the “WACC”), adjusted for the specific circumstances of the CGUs, and based on management’s experience, and grossed-up to arrive at the pre-tax rate.

Based on the value-in-use, impairment losses amounting to US$600,000 (2022: US$600,000) was recognised in “Other operating expenses” (Note 6) for the financial year ended 31 March 2023. The impairment losses are included in the segment result of Asia Pacific region as the development expenditure is located in Singapore.

# Impairment losses of development expenditure

# Sensitivity analysis for impairment losses of development expenditure

The Group expects certain products to be competitive and if sales achieved in the forecast year dropped by 15% from the Group’s forecasted quantities, with other assumptions remaining constant, the carrying amount of certain developments will show additional impairment losses of the CGUs as follow:

| |Group|Adjusted carrying amount|Additional impairment loss|
|---|---|---|---|
|2023|Satellite communication (“Satcom”)|US$ 88,381|US$ 25,000|

|Less: loss allowance (Note 39)|(6,000,000)|(6,000,000)| |
|Total| |2,228,792|1,448,493|

The Group’s trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally ranging from 0 to 60 (2022: 0 to 60) days term. They are recognised at their original invoice amounts which represent their fair values on initial recognition.

Trade receivables include an amount of US$6,000,000 (2022: US$6,000,000) pertaining to a one-off licensing income. The settlement of the consideration will be at the option of the trade debtor, either by way of cash or issuance of shares to the Group. The customer had opted to issue shares to settle the outstanding trade receivable. On 29 May 2020, the customer entered into an addendum to extend the deadline for the transfer of shares to 15 July 2020 and both parties agreed that the shares of the customer to be issued to the Group shall be worth US$6,000,000 based on the fund raising to be concluded by the customer. On 17 August 2020, the customer issued a trust deed to the Group stating that they had earmarked to issue a minimum of 2,000,000 shares valued at US$3 each for the settlement. On 29 September 2020, management entered into another addendum with the customer to further extend the deadline for the transfer of shares to 31 December 2021. On 1 January 2022, management entered into another addendum with the customer to further extend the deadline for the transfer of shares to 31 December 2022. In consideration of the delays of the transfer of the shares by the customer and the heightened volatility and uncertainty in the economic environment that the customer operates in, the management is of the view that there has been a significant increase in credit risk relating to the receivable since initial recognition. With reference to SFRS(I) 9, accordingly, the Group recorded loss allowance of US$6,000,000 in the last financial year. The amount remains outstanding as of 31 March 2023 and thus the loss allowance remains unchanged as at 31 March 2023.

On 4 November 2022 (the “Completion Date”), the Company issued redeemable convertible bonds (the “bonds”) with principal amount of S$5.0 million (approximately US$3.6 million) at a discounted price of S$0.931. The bonds bear a fixed interest rate of 6% per annum on the amount outstanding under the bonds, which is payable on semi-anniversary of the Completion Date until the bonds principal is fully repaid.

The bonds come with a redeemable feature, which allows the Company to redeem the bonds after the third anniversary of the issue date till the maturity date.

The bonds are also convertible at the option of the holders into 294,490,588 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the “conversion shares”) at a fixed conversion price of S$0.017 per conversion shares at any time after completion date but not less than 10 days prior to the maturity date.

The Company shall on the maturity date, redeem the bonds from the holders by repaying the outstanding loan principal in full and all interest that remain outstanding.

The instrument contains an embedded derivative and the Company has designated the entire instrument at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition. As such the embedded derivative is not separated.

The Company determines the amount of fair value changes using binomial tree model. The fair value of the liability component is calculated using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond at the date of issuance.

# 38. SEGMENT INFORMATION

For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on their geographical areas as the Group’s risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by geographical areas.

The Group is engaged in a single business of sales of telecommunication equipment and related products and components and provision of related design services. During the reporting years, the Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units. For each of the strategic business units, the directors review internal management reports on a regular basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments:

- Segment 1: Europe Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) included sales made to customers based in Spain, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) and other countries within the region;
- Segment 2: North America included sales made to customers based in United States of America, Canada and other countries within the region;
- Segment 3: Asia Pacific included sales made to customers based in Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, China, Philippines, Australia, and other countries within the region.

Except as indicated above, no operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Group’s financing (including finance costs) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. There is no transfer pricing between operating segments as there is no inter-segment transaction.

Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

The Group operates from Asia Pacific region. Segment assets and liabilities for other segments (EMEA and North America) mainly includes the balances with the customers or suppliers located in the respective regions. Other segment assets (mainly comprising intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and inventories) and other segment liabilities are presented based on its location, being the Asia Pacific region.

# 39. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISKS

The Group’s activities expose it to credit risk, market risks (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise adverse effects from the volatility of financial markets on the Group’s financial performance.

The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the objectives and underlying principles of financial risk management for the Group. The management then establishes the detailed policies such as authority levels, oversight responsibilities, risk identification and measurement, exposure limits and hedging strategies, in accordance with the objectives and underlying principles approved by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee provides independent oversight to the effectiveness of the risk management process. It is and has been throughout the current and previous financial year, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes shall be undertaken.

There have been no changes to the Group's exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis indicated below.

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group performs ongoing credit evaluation of its counterparties’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral.

The Group’s and Company’s major classes of financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables. Bank balances are mainly deposits with banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and the Group does not expect the impairment loss from bank balances to be material, if any.

To assess and manage its credit risk, the Group categorises the aforementioned financial assets according to their risk of default. The Group defines default to have taken place when internal or/and external information indicates that the financial asset is unlikely to be received, which could include a breach of debt covenant, default of interest due for more than 30 days, but not later than when the financial asset is more than 90 days past due as per SFRS(I) 9’s presumption.

Due to the nature of the industry that the Group operates in where repayment periods are generally longer and the industry and Group’s customary practise, the Group has rebutted the presumption included in SFRS(I) 9 that there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition when financial assets are more than 30 days past due. The Group has determined that there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition when financial assets are more than 90 days past due.

In their assessment, the management considers, amongst other factors, the latest relevant credit ratings from reputable external rating agencies where available and deemed appropriate, historical credit experiences, latest available financial information and latest applicable credit reputation of the debtor.

The Group’s internal credit risk grading categories are as follows:

|Category|Description|Basis of recognising ECL|
|---|---|---|
|1|Low credit riskNote 1|12-months ECL|
|2|Non-significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and financial asset is ≤ 90 days past due| |
|3|Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognitionNote 2 or financial asset is > 90 days past due| |
|4|Evidence indicates that financial asset is credit-impairedNote 3| |
|5|Evidence indicates that the management has no reasonable expectations of recovering the write off amountNote 4| |

Note 1. Low credit risk

12-months ECL

Lifetime ECL

Difference between financial asset’s gross carrying amount and present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate

Written-off

The financial asset is determined to have low credit risk if the financial assets have a low risk of default, the counterparty has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the counterparty to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations. Generally, this is the case when the Group assesses and determines that the debtor has been, is in and is highly likely to be, in the foreseeable future and during the (contractual) term of the financial asset, in a financial position that will allow the debtor to settle the financial asset as and when it falls due.

Note 2. Significant increase in credit risk

In assessing whether the credit risk of the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of default occurring on the financial asset as of reporting date with the risk of default occurring on the financial asset as of date of initial recognition, and considered reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition. In assessing the significance of the change in the risk of default, the Group considers both past due (i.e. whether it is more than 90 days past due) and forward looking quantitative and qualitative information. Forward looking information includes the assessment of the latest performance and financial position of the debtor, adjusted for the Group’s future outlook of the industry in which the debtor operates based on independently obtained information (e.g. expert reports, analyst’s reports etc.) and the most recent news or market talks about the debtor, as applicable. In its assessment, the Group will generally, for example, assess whether the deterioration of the financial performance and/or financial position, adverse change in the economic environment (country and industry in which the debtor operates), deterioration of credit risk of the debtor, etc. is in line with its expectation as of the date of initial recognition of the financial asset. Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contract payments are >90 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

# Credit risk (Continued)

# Note 3. Credit impaired

In determining whether financial assets are credit-impaired, the Group assesses whether one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the following observable data:

- Significant financial difficulty of the debtor;
- Breach of contract, such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;
- It is becoming probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- The disappearance of an active market for the financial asset because of financial difficulties.

# Note 4. Write off

Generally, the Group writes off, partially or fully, the financial asset when it assesses that there is no realistic prospect of recovery of the amount as evidenced by, for example, the debtor's lack of assets or income sources that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subjected to the write-off.

The Group performs ongoing credit evaluation of its counterparties’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral.

The Group and Company do not have any significant credit exposure to any single counterparty or any groups of counterparties having similar characteristics.

With reference to Note 26, the Company provides financial guarantees to certain banks and other financial institutions in respect of facilities granted to one of its subsidiaries. The date when the Group becomes a committed party to the guarantee is considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purpose of assessing the financial asset for impairment. In determining whether there has been a significant risk of a default occurring on the drawn-down facilities, the Group considered the change in the risk that the specified debtor (i.e. the applicable subsidiaries) will default on the contract. The Company assessed that the credit risk relating to the financial guarantees is insignificant to the Company.

As at the end of the financial year, there was significant concentration of credit risk. Trade receivables from 3 (2022: 3) customers accounted for approximately 80% (2022: 88%) of total trade receivables of the Group. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statements of financial position.

# Trade receivables (Note 17)

The Group uses the practical expedient under SFRS(I) 9 in the form of allowance matrix to measure the ECL for trade receivables, where the loss allowance is equal to lifetime ECL.

The ECL for trade receivables are estimated using an allowance matrix by reference to the historical credit loss experience of the customers for the last 3 years prior to the respective reporting dates for various customer groups that are assessed by geographical locations, product types and internal ratings, adjusted for forward looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment which could affect the ability of the debtors to settle the financial assets. In considering the impact of the economic environment on the ECL rates, the Group assesses, for example, the gross domestic production growth rates of the countries (eg. Singapore, United States of America, Japan) and the growth rates of the major industries which its customers operate in.

# Other receivables (Note 18)

As of 31 March 2023, the Group recorded gross other receivables and deposits of US$477,044 and US$159,407 (2022: US$426,363 and US$85,382) respectively. The Group assessed the loss allowance of these amounts on a 12-month ECL basis consequent to their assessment and conclusion that these other receivables and deposits are of low credit risk except for one of the other receivables amounted to US$380,700 (2022: US$339,975), which have financial difficulties as of 31 March 2023. In its assessment of the credit risk of the other receivables, the Group considered amongst other factors, the financial position of the other receivables as of 31 March 2023, the past financial performance and cashflow trends, adjusted for the outlook of the industry and economy in which the receivables operate in. Using 12-month ECL, the Group determined that the ECL is US$380,700 (2022: US$339,975).

# Due from subsidiaries (Note 20)

As of 31 March 2023, the Company recorded other receivables from subsidiaries of US$8,000,901 (2022: US$10,327,566) consequent to an extension of loans to the subsidiaries. The Company assessed the loss allowance of these amounts on a 12-month ECL basis consequent to their assessment and conclusion that these receivables are of low credit risk. In its assessment of the credit risk of the subsidiaries, the Company considered amongst other factors, the financial position of the subsidiaries as of 31 March 2023, the past financial performance and cashflow trends, adjusted for the outlook of the industry and economy in which the subsidiaries operate in. Using 12-month ECL, the Company determined that the ECL is insignificant.

# Market risks

The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.

# Foreign currency risk

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on certain income, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective entities in the Group. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily Singapore dollar, Euro, Chinese Renminbi, British Sterling Pound and Malaysian Ringgit.

The carrying amounts of the Group’s and of the Company’s foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities as at the end of the financial year are as follows:

# Foreign exchange risk sensitivity

The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% (2022: 10%) increase and decrease in the relevant foreign currencies against the functional currency of each Group entity. 10% (2022: 10%) is the sensitivity rate representing management’s assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% (2022: 10%) change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where they give rise to an impact on the Group’s profit or loss.

If the relevant foreign currency strengthens by 10% (2022: 10%) against the functional currency of each Group entity, with all other variables held constant, profit or loss for the year and equity will increase/(decrease) by:

| |Singapore dollar| | |US$| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|2023|Group|Loss for the year| |(468,077)| |
| |Company|Loss for the year| |(360,733)| |
| | |2022|Group|Loss for the year|(638,791)|
| |Company|Loss for the year| |(350,319)| |

A 10% weakening of functional currency of each Group entity against the above currencies would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above.

# Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group’s interest rate risk relates to interest bearing liabilities.

The Group’s policy is to maintain an efficient and optimal interest cost structure using a combination of fixed and variable rate debts, and long and short-term borrowings.

Interests on the Group’s loans (Note 26) are on fixed rates that prevail until the maturity of the instruments. No other financial instruments of the Group are subject to interest rate risk.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk refer to the risk in which the Group encounters difficulties in meeting its short-term obligations. Liquidity risk is managed by matching the payment and receipt cycle.

The Group manages its liquidity risk by ensuring the availability of funding through committed credit facilities from a bank and financial institutions. In addition, the Group has also sought for investment funds via issuing of shares and convertible loans to finance its cash flow and operations.

The following table shows details of the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial instruments. The table has been drawn up based on contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial instruments based on the earlier of the contractual date or when the Group is expected to receive or (pay). The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

# 40. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

The fair values of applicable assets and liabilities are determined and categorised using a fair value hierarchy as follows:

1. Level 1 – the fair values of assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and which trade in active markets that the Group can access at the measurement date are determined with reference to quoted market prices (unadjusted).
2. Level 2 – in the absence of quoted market prices, the fair values of the assets and liabilities are determined using the other observable, either directly or indirectly, inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets or included within Level 1, quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in non-active markets.
3. Level 3 – in the absence of quoted market prices included within Level 1 and observable inputs included within Level 2, the fair values of the remaining assets and liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models.

Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

Financial instruments whose carrying amount approximates fair value

The carrying amounts of cash and bank balances, trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments), bank borrowings, trade and other payables and amounts due from/(to) subsidiaries approximate their respective fair values due to the relative short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The non-current borrowings which are carried at amortised cost and bear a fixed interest rate. Fair value information is not disclosed as there is a lack of market information of comparable instruments with similar characteristics and risk profile.

# 41. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through optimisation of debt and equity balance except where decisions are made to exit businesses or close companies.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debts, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 25 and equity attributable to owners of the Company, comprising issued capital, retained earnings and reserves as disclosed in Notes 32 to 35 respectively and statements of changes in equity.

The Group's management reviews the capital structure on a regular basis. As part of this review, management considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. Upon review, the Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares and share buybacks. The Group's overall strategy remains unchanged from 31 March 2022.

# 41. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES (CONTINUED)

Management monitors capital based on a gearing ratio of less than one. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
