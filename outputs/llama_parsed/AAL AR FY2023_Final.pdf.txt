# LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR

As we contemplate the past year, I am struck by the enduring resilience and collective resolve that define our organisation. FY2023 served as a testament to our unity and adept navigation through tumultuous times—not merely surviving but thriving. Overcoming the hurdles of the past year has deepened our commitment not only to pursuing excellence but also to fostering a significant impact on the community. It is our shared purpose and unwavering commitment to progress that will propel us forward collaboratively.

The increase in revenue was attributable to the Exhibitions segment, which saw an increase in the number of participants and the selling price for its rental of exhibition booths. The Business Impact Assessment and Recognition segment continued to be our main revenue driver in FY2023, contributing 91.9% of our total revenue in FY2023.

The Group experienced an 11.7% y-o-y decline in gross profit from S$9.10 million in FY2022 to S$8.04 million in FY2023. This was due to increased direct costs related to venue, production, and performance for the Business Impact Assessment and Recognition segment. We have also spent more on increasing the quality and production value of our product offerings, to ensure our events remain ahead of the competition.

# EMBRACING SUSTAINABILITY AND FUTURE GROWTH

Looking forward to 2024, we are excited to introduce a sustainability certification. This initiative aligns with the growing global sustainability movement and will assist our clients in meeting evolving sustainability requirements. Our commitment to sustainable business practices is steadfast, and we will judiciously pursue growth opportunities that align with our values and make practical business sense.

# LOOKING AHEAD

Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Audience Analytics Limited (“Audience Analytics”), I am pleased to present our Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (“FY2023”).

# NAVIGATING ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES

The past year witnessed significant challenges, marked by global economic volatility and escalating geopolitical conflicts. Singapore’s GDP growth slowed to 1.2%, reflecting reduced global demand. In Hong Kong, challenging external environment and tightened financial conditions weighed on the economy, with 2023 real GDP growth coming in at 3.2%. Malaysia faced a decline in its manufacturing activities, especially with weakness in the electronics sector, compounded by the global tech downcycle and external market fluctuations.

Globally, the Ukraine-Russia conflict disrupted international trade and energy supplies, while the Middle East conflict, particularly in the Gaza Strip, led to widespread humanitarian issues and affected regional economies, especially in tourism and trade.

These events created an environment of economic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical risks, impacting international relations and economic growth. Despite these challenges, Audience Analytics adopted a defensive strategy that safeguarded our operations across different markets, ensuring our resilience and sustained success.

# FINANCIAL REVIEW

The Group’s revenue increased 3.5% y-o-y to S$14.63 million in FY2023 from S$14.13 million in the 12 months ended 31 December 2022. Overall expenses also increased in FY2023 compared to FY2022. Coupled with the softer gross profits, the Group saw an 18.4% y-o-y decline in net profit.

While 2023 was a year that required cautious navigation through multiple economic challenges, it has also been a period where we were able to lay the strategic groundwork for future growth and sustainable expansion. We stand ready to embrace the plethora of opportunities ahead, driven by our commitment to excellence and sustainability.

The Group proposed a final dividend of 1.70 Singapore cents per share, representing a payout ratio of 62.1% of the Group’s FY2023 net profit.

# INVESTING IN BRAND AND EVENT ENHANCEMENT

Despite fiscal constraints, we pressed ahead with our investments to boost our brand and enhance our product offerings. This will ensure that our events stay competitive and reinforce our dominant position in the market. These investments are crucial to sustain our long-term growth and profitability.

# LEVERAGING GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY

Our extensive geographic footprint proved invaluable in FY2023, serving as a natural buffer against pervasive currency fluctuations experienced during the year. We remain vigilant.

1. Singapore’s GDP growth slows to 1.2% in 2023

2. Hong Kong Economic Development

3. Malaysia posts 3.3% in 3Q

4. Middle East Conflict Risks

5. Based on existing number of shares in the Company of 169.3 million.

# REVIEW OF GROUP PERFORMANCE

# REVENUE

The Group’s revenue increased by S$0.50 million from S$14.13 million in FY2022 to S$14.63 million in FY2023, mainly due to an increase in revenue from the Exhibitions segment by S$0.47 million.

# COST OF SALES

Cost of sales increased by S$1.56 million from S$5.03 million in FY2022 to S$6.59 million in FY2023, mainly due to (i) an increase in event-related costs such as cost of venue, production cost and performance cost as the Group hosted physical events in Hong Kong, China, Philippines, and Indonesia in FY2023, while the Group hosted virtual events in those countries in FY2022. The Group also spent more on increasing the quality and production value of its product offerings, to ensure its events remain ahead of the competition, and (ii) an increase in exhibition-related costs such as cost of venue and production cost in line with the increase in revenue from the Exhibitions segment.

# ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

# OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

Other operating expenses increased by S$0.08 million from S$0.16 million in FY2022 to S$0.24 million in FY2023 mainly due to an increase in net foreign exchange loss arising from the weakening of Ringgit Malaysia and US Dollar against the Singapore Dollar during FY2023.

# BUSINESS OUTLOOK

# CONGRATULATIONS OF CXP AWARD 2023

The revival of the Group’s live-format events under the Business Impact Assessment and Recognition and Exhibitions segments played a crucial role in sustaining its strong market presence in 2023. This ensured that the Group continued to deliver sustainable value to its clients despite a difficult macroeconomic backdrop marked by rising inflation, high-interest rates and increasing geopolitical tensions.

The Asian region is expected to experience economic growth in 2024, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting an expansion rate of 4.5%1. This momentum will be driven by amongst others, increased government spending, easing supply chain challenges, and a surge in technology demand, particularly in China and Thailand. This positive economic outlook will likely create a more vibrant business environment, making it crucial for organisations to attract and retain top talent. As a result, the Group anticipates a rise in demand for employee engagement and branding to improve satisfaction, and reduce employee turnover rates.

However, the Group is aware of geopolitical risks which could dampen the overall economic outlook for the Asian region. This could result in slower growth and reduced consumer confidence in the region.

To prepare for this, the Group will focus on maintaining a robust financial position and explore opportunities to expand its market presence through, amongst others, acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances. The Group will also continue to harness emerging opportunities from the evolving business environment across the region’s economies.

# ABOUT THE REPORT

# Reporting Framework

# BOARD STATEMENT

Dear Stakeholders,

On Behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), I am pleased to present Audience Analytics Limited’s (the “Company” or “AAL”, together with all its subsidiaries, the “Group”) third annual Sustainability Report (the “Sustainability Report”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (“FY2023”). It details the progress the Group has made in fulfilling our commitments towards sustainability over the past year.

This Sustainability Report was prepared with reference to the reporting principles and requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Universal Standards 2021. The GRI Standards were selected as they are a reputable global framework for reporting on an organisation’s economic, environmental, and social impacts. We also adopted the TCFD recommendations as it represents the best global set of comparable climate-related disclosures.

In compliance with Rule 711A and 711B of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) Listing Manual Section B: Rules of Catalist, this Sustainability Report includes the requisite primary components of a sustainability report on a ‘comply or explain’ basis. In FY2023, we commenced a phased approach for the incorporation of the TCFD disclosures. Details of the disclosures and an implementation timeline of our phased approach can be found in the “TCFD report” section of this Sustainability Report.

The Board assumes overall responsibility for the Group’s sustainability matters, and is in charge of directing the integration of sustainable practices into the business strategy and operations. Additionally, the Board oversees the Group’s comprehensive corporate governance practices, identifies material factors, and supervises the management and monitoring of these significant aspects. Regular meetings are conducted by the Board to scrutinise and approve major strategic plans that pertain to sustainability.

In consideration of global climate change issues, we have begun climate reporting and assessing the impact the Group may face. Our reporting is in line with some of the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations, with a timeline that explains how the Group will fully comply with the TCFD recommendations in our future sustainability reports.

Looking ahead, the Group has recently incorporated a subsidiary which will broaden our service lines by offering sustainability training. This strategic move is expected to enhance the Group’s value proposition and to support our commitment to sustainability in the long run.

The Group recognises that in the challenging business environment that we are likely to face going ahead, it is critical that the Group balances the business needs with sustainability concerns to ensure that we will remain resilient and healthy.

The Group will continue actively engaging both existing and potential stakeholders to better understand and address their interests and issues. We want to cultivate strong partnerships so that we can create impactful sustainability initiatives that generate value for all stakeholders.

The Group deeply values the ongoing support from our management team, our dedicated employees, our business partners, and all stakeholders who have played important roles in our sustainability journey thus far.

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

In FY2021, the Group conducted our first materiality assessment process, encompassing the following four stages:

1. Identify: Material EESG topics were identified through internal focus group discussions, representing various external stakeholder groups.
2. Prioritise: These topics were then aligned with GRI Standards, and their impacts were assessed within the framework of our business strategy and operations.
3. Validate: The Board internally validated the shortlisted material EESG topics.
4. Review: The Group consistently monitors shifts in our business environment, stakeholder feedback, and emerging sustainability trends, prompting a reassessment of our material topics as needed.

The Group reviewed our material EESG topics disclosed in FY2022 and assessed that they are still material to our business and stakeholders. There is no addition of new topics for FY2023. The following table outlines our commitments and performance in FY2023, comparing them to the targets set for each material topic previously. The table also includes our future targets for each material topic.

|EESG Topics|Our Commitments|Targets for FY2023| |Our Performance in FY2023| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Economic Performance|To generate long-term value for our stakeholders, by maintaining consistent profits, a robust balance sheet and strong operating cash flows|To meet our revenue targets and grow our operations in existing markets.|We achieved our overall target revenue and grew our operations in markets which we recently embarked on 2-3 years ago.| | | | | |

The Group also participates in the local statutory pension schemes for all applicable employees.

# Performance

The Group’s revenue increased by S$0.50 million from S$14.13 million in FY2022 to S$14.63 million in FY2023, mainly due to an increase in revenue from the Exhibitions segment by S$0.47 million or 73.4%, mainly attributable to an increase in the number of participants and increase in selling prices for rental of exhibition booths for the Malaysia Career & Training Fair held in FY2023. We continue to strive towards achieving our revenue targets each year and seek opportunities to expand into new markets to generate value for all stakeholders.

Taking the difference between economic value generated and distributed, our economic value retained for FY2023 is S$1.47 million.

In FY2023, the Group was granted investment grants of approximately S$1,700 by the Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau for organising an awards event.

The Group publishes half-yearly and full-year announcements on the Company’s corporate website and SGXNet to keep all stakeholders informed. For a narration of the Group’s financial performance, please refer to page 20-21 in our Annual Report.

# EMPLOYMENT

The following table details a breakdown of our economic value generated (revenue):

|By Business Segments (S$)|FY2021 (audited)|FY2022 (audited)|FY2023 (audited)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Business Impact Assessment and Recognition|9,344,436|13,342,390|13,448,906|

|Total|9,875,899|14,133,791|14,629,949|

Valuing our employees as our greatest asset, the Group prioritises their well-being for long-term success as we believe that a healthy workforce with high morale boosts productivity. We also actively seek new talent to join our team. Our employee benefits and other matters relating to employment are stated in our employee manual, which is available to all staff through our human resource system. Employee benefits are offered equally to both our permanent and temporary employees.

As part of our effort to retain employees and key talents, the Group constantly reviews our compensation and benefits packages, provide additional training opportunities, and solicit feedback from employees during their appraisal sessions to identify areas for improvement. In addition, we organise after-work and sport activities, and have in place a health program which rewards employees for maintaining a healthy Body Mass Index.

The Group fully complies with local employment legislation and regulatory requirements. All employees are entitled to yearly medical claims, health screening and parental leave benefits.

The Group also improved our employee benefits by increasing our staff income with basic increments, and introducing a new meal allowance. We are also embarking on significant renovations to our main offices for an improved working space for our employees. This is expected to be completed in April 2024.

Parental Leave

The Group strongly encourage its employees to use the parental leave benefits granted to them and be assured that they can take this leave and return to work in the same or a comparable position. The following tables show the breakdown of how parental leave had been used by our employees over the last two reporting periods.

|Parental Leave|FY2022|FY2022|FY2022|FY2023|FY2023|FY2023|
|---|---|---|
| |Female|Male|Total|Female|Male|Total|
|Number of employees entitled to parental leave|2|0|2|0|1|1|
|Number of employees who took parental leave during the reporting period|2|0|2|0|1|1|
|Number of employees that returned to work in the reporting period after parental leave ended|2|0|2|0|1|1|
|Total number of employees due to return to work after taking parental leave|2|0|2|0|1|1|

Return to work rate is based on “Number of team members who returned to work in the reporting period” over “Total number of employees due to return to work after taking parental leave”. Retention rate is based on “Number of team members who returned to work and were still employed 12 months later” over “total number of employees returning from parental leave in the prior reporting period”. Computed based on number of new hires for the reporting period divided by headcount as of the end of the reporting period. Computed based on number of resignees for the reporting period divided by headcount as of the end of the reporting period.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# TRAINING AND EDUCATION

As the business environment undergoes constant transformation, companies must prioritise their workforce’s skill development. The Group firmly believes that empowering our employees is vital for sustaining a competitive edge.

Acknowledging the imperative of investing in our employees’ development, we implement training programs, including in-house trainings and hands-on mentorship, accessible to all eligible staff, without discrimination based on gender or age. We actively encourage employees to explore external training and educational opportunities that align with their personal and professional growth objectives.

# Regular performance and career development reviews

The Group conducts regular performance and career development assessments for our employees to assess the strengths and needs of our workforce. All our permanent and temporary employees underwent an annual performance appraisal exercise in FY2023. Through these annual performance appraisals, we can assess their eligibility for promotions or salary increases fairly and equitably. We also enhance our understanding of how we can better support employee growth, by obtaining feedback from the employees during their appraisals. Additionally, in January 2024 we have completed the creation of a learning portal for our employees. The learning portal provides our employees with better access to relevant courses and the Group’s policies and procedures. As employees attend these courses, each employee’s course progress will also be tracked and displayed on the learning portal.

Our unwavering commitment is to empower employees in their self-directed development, equipping them with the necessary tools and resources to thrive in their careers at AAL.

# OPTIMISING RESOURCE USAGE

# Performance

# Training hours

The Group supports our employees to take courses on Entrepreneurship and Talent Management at the HELP University ELM Graduate School, where our employees spent 9 hours on average on these courses in FY2023.

Our training hours for employees decreased by 28.8% compared to FY2022, mainly as the Group focused on having majority of our employees undergo a refresher of past training courses from FY2022. Hence, more employees were involved in training this year. Below is the breakdown of our training hours for all our employees by gender and employee category.

|Category|Total training hours|Total employees|Total attended|
|---|---|---|---|
|Female|264|29|13|
|Male|444|37|17|
|Total|708|66|30|

In FY2023, as we gradually resume physical activities in Singapore post COVID-19, all our award ceremonies were held physically. Despite the physical events, we consciously and proactively ensure we do not print our publications unnecessarily and have continued our practice of not printing winner books for all countries. The Group has ceased the usage of newspaper advertisements and instead, transitioned to digital advertisements for the SME100 Awards. This saves an additional 158,000 sheets of paper in FY2023.

# The digitalisation of our publications is summarised in the following table:

|Publications|2021|2022|2023|
|---|---|---|---|
|SME Magazine|Digital|Digital|Print & Digital|
|HR Asia|Digital|Digital|Digital|
|Golden Bull Award Winner Book|Print|Digital|Digital|
|SME100 Awards Winner Book|Print|Digital|Digital|
|Best Employers Book|Print|Digital|Digital|
|Capital Asia|Print|Print|Print & Digital|

With the commencement of digitalisation for our Capital Asia publications, the Group has now incorporated digitalisation for all types of publications. The introduction of digitalisation of our Capital Asia publications saved us around 100,800 sheets of paper in FY2023. As the Group gradually phases out physical printing, we aim to further optimise our resource usage in the years to come.

5 A minimal print run is produced for selected readers and for marketing purposes.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Ensuring the protection of IP is crucial for nurturing innovation and maintaining our competitive edge as a Group. We are committed to protecting our IP, encompassing proprietary business analytic tools, media brands, and business awards. We prioritise the prompt registration of all crucial trademarks. Additionally, we strictly adhere to applicable laws and regulations in respect of intellectual property rights.

# Performance

The Group has continued to broaden and protect its IP by registering three (3) new trademarks in Indonesia in FY2023. As at the end of FY2023, the Group had 47 registered trademarks.

During FY2023, the Group had no reported cases of IP infringement or non-compliance with IP-related laws and regulations. To mitigate IP theft and infringement risks, the Group will continue to regularly assess and strengthen our existing processes concerning all matters regarding the protection of intellectual property.

# TCFD REPORT

# Governance

The Board exercises supervision over all matters related to climate. The senior management team bears the responsibility for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, the senior management team will convene with the Board annually to provide updates and engage in discussions regarding climate-related matters.

In FY2023, we started to assess our climate risks and opportunities and begun establishing the required governance structure and risk management practices. Our phased approach towards full adoption of TCFD recommendations is reflected in the implementation timeline below:

|TCFD Pillar|Year 1 (FY2023)|Year 2 (FY2024)|Year 3 (FY2025)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Governance|Described the governance structures, including Board oversight and the management’s role.| | |
|Strategy|Identified the climate-related risks and opportunities.|Disclose more qualitative impacts of new or existing climate risks and opportunities.|Improve scenario analysis by identifying and evaluating more quantitative outcomes.|

In FY2023, to align with the TCFD recommendations, we completed our first exercise to identify and assess our climate-related risks and opportunities that are significant and relevant to our business operations.

To effectively discuss these climate-related risks and opportunities, we have determined the appropriate durations used to define short-, medium-, and long-term, as follows:

- Short-term: within 2 years
- Medium-term: from 2 – 10 years
- Long-term: from 11 – 25 years

These timeframes were carefully chosen following an evaluation of the lifespan of our property, plant and equipment (including vehicles, billboards, computers, and office equipment) and right-of-use assets (including office premises and warehouse rentals). They take into account the understanding that climate issues frequently unfold over medium and long-term horizons.

# Risk Management

The Group has a formalised risk management framework for assessing its climate-related risks. This framework contains a risk assessment matrix and a list of defined parameters and risk levels which helps the Group rank and prioritise our identified risks in a systemic manner. This way, the significances of all our climate risks identified are determined and comparable relative to one another quantitatively. In addition, we take into consideration existing and emerging regulatory requirements to climate change when identifying, assessing and managing our risks.

# GHG Emissions (Scope 2) produced in FY2023

|Total Electricity Consumption (kWh)|Amount of GHG Emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e)|
|---|---|
|Purchased Electricity from Malaysia’s grid|23.0536|
|Purchased Electricity for Group’s hybrid vehicle|0.053|
|Total|23.106|

Moving forward, we aim to further identify and assess more physical and transition risks in our business operations to make possible mitigation plans and ensure that our business remains sustainable.

# GHG Emissions intensity

|Metrics and Targets|Amount|
|---|---|
|Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions (tCOe)|26.704|
|Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions| |
|Revenue (in S$ million)|14.630|
|GHG Emissions intensity ratio (tCOe / S$ million)|1.825|

Considering the global emphasis on addressing climate change, there is a rising demand from countries and consumers for corporations to measure and mitigate their GHG emissions. Consequently, we recognise the crucial need to determine our carbon footprint and to undertake measures to manage it. FY2023 is the first year we are publishing quantitative data on our GHG emissions. We have selected FY2023 as the baseline year for us to monitor and assess improvements to our GHG emissions performance moving forward. To compute our GHG emissions, we utilised the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, established by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

The following table illustrates the total GHG emissions produced by the Group for FY2023. We adopted the operational control method for our consolidation approach. Scope 1 emissions are attributable to the gasoline used by all our vehicles. Our Scope 2 emissions are attributable to our purchase of electricity from the energy grid of Malaysia and from the charging stations used for the Group’s hybrid vehicle. As our Singapore and Hong Kong offices reside within co-working spaces, within which the electricity consumption is not within our control, these emissions are considered as Scope 3 emissions. Similarly, the Group’s events conducted at external venues, business travel, and employee commuting are also classified as Scope 3 emissions under the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard. Scope 3 emissions are excluded from the scope of this Sustainability Report.

# GHG Emissions (Scope 1) produced in FY2023

|Non-Renewable Fuel Consumption|Amount of GHG Emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e)|
|---|---|
|Gasoline|3.598|
|Total|3.598|

Computed based on 2021 grid emission factor of 0.758 kg CO2/kWh derived from Malaysia Energy Information Hub’s published figures

Each Board Committee functions within clearly defined terms of reference and operating procedures, which are reviewed periodically by the Board. Where necessary, the terms of reference and operating procedures would be updated to keep in line with the Catalist Rules and the Code 2018, and to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness of each Board Committee. The composition and description of each Board Committee are set out in this report. Please refer to the respective principles as set out in this report for further information on the activities of each Board Committee.

When a Director has multiple board representations, the NC will consider whether or not the Director is able to and has adequately carried out his/her duties as a Director of the Company, taking into consideration the Director’s number of listed company board representations and other principal commitments. In support of their candidature for directorship or re-election, Directors are to provide the NC with details of their other commitments and an indication of the time involved. The Board and the NC have established a guideline on the maximum number of listed company directorships that each Director is allowed to hold and this guideline can be found under Provision 4.5 of this report.

# Provision 1.6 – Complete, Adequate and Timely Information

While the Board Committees have the authority to examine particular issues and will report back to the Board with their decisions and/or recommendations, the ultimate responsibility on all matters lies with the Board.

# Provision 1.5 – Board and Board Committee Meetings and Attendance Records

The schedule of all Board and Board Committees meetings as well as the annual general meeting of the Company (“AGM”) for the next calendar year is planned in advance. The Board meets at least once every half yearly and it also meets regularly to review, consider and approve strategic, operational and financial matters. Important matters concerning the Group are put before the Board for its decision and approval. Where necessary, additional or ad-hoc meetings may be held to address significant transactions or issues.

The Directors have unrestricted access to the Company’s records and information, minutes of the Board and Board Committee meetings, and management accounts so as to enable them to make informed decisions and carry out their duties. Directors may also liaise with senior executives and other employees to seek additional information if required.

Detailed Board papers and agenda with the relevant background or explanatory information relating to the business of the meeting and information on major operational, financial and corporate issues, are circulated to the Directors before meetings so that all Directors can better understand the issues beforehand, allowing more time at such meetings for questions that the Directors may have. Such Board papers generally include budgets and periodic management accounts. In respect of budgets, any material variances between the projections and actual results are disclosed and explained to the Board. Directors are also informed on a regular basis as and when there are any significant developments or events relating to the Group’s business operations.

To facilitate meetings, the Company’s Constitution allows for meetings to be held through telephone and/or videoconferencing.

# Provision 1.7 – Independent Access to Management, Company Secretary and External Advisers

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Board Composition and Guidance

# Provision 2.1 – Board Independence

Principle 2: The board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company. The NC reviews the independence of the Directors annually. The NC considers the guidelines set out in the Code 2018, the Practice Guidance and Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules in determining whether a Director is independent.

# Board Diversity Policy

The Company recognises and embraces the benefits of diversity on the Board and views board diversity as an essential element in supporting the attainment of its strategic objectives and its sustainable development. It also promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, mitigates groupthink and enhances the Board’s overall decision-making capability.

The Company has adopted a Board Diversity Policy which sets out its approach to achieve diversity of the Board. Pursuant to the Board Diversity Policy, the NC will review the structure, size and composition (including but not limited to the gender, age, education background, professional experiences, skills and knowledge) of the Board at least annually and assist the Board in reviewing the required mix of skills, knowledge, experience and other qualities which the Directors should bring to the Board on an annual basis.

Under the Board Diversity Policy, the Board has set the following diversity objectives, including having (i) gender diversity with at least 30% female representation on the Board; (ii) age diversity by having members of the Board from different age groups; (iii) balance of skills appropriate for the requirements of the business of the Group; and (iv) appropriate level of independence of the Board. All appointments will be based on merit of candidates, in the context of the skills and having due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, our needs and our core values.

# The current Board composition reflects the Company’s commitment to Board diversity as follows:

|GENDER FOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS|AGE GROUPS FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS|INDEPENDENCE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS|
|---|---|---|
|Female|No of directors|No of directors|
|60%|0|2|
|40%|40 - 49|Independent Directors|
| |50 - 59|Executive Directors|
| |60 and above| |

Under Provision 2.1 of the Code 2018, an independent director is one who is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgement in view of the best interests of the Company.

Each Independent Director is required to complete a form to confirm his/her independence upon appointment and subsequently on an annual basis. The Independent Directors have confirmed that, in accordance with the Code 2018, they do not have any relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Directors’ independent business judgment in view of the best interests of the Company.

Under Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules, it stipulates that a Director will not be considered as independent under any of the following circumstances:

- if he/she is employed by the Company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three (3) financial years;
- if he/she has an immediate family member who is or has been in any of the past three (3) financial years, employed by the Company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the RC of the Company; or
- if he/she has been a director for an aggregate period of more than nine (9) years (whether before or after listing of the Company on the Catalist Board of the SGX-ST (the “Listing”). He/she may continue to be considered independent until the conclusion of the next AGM.

In this regard, each of the Independent Directors have confirmed that he/she and his/her respective associates do not have any employment relationships with the Company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three (3) financial years. At present, none of the Independent Directors have served the Company for more than nine (9) years from his/her date of first appointment to the Board.

The NC has reviewed and determined that Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin, Datuk Alexandra Chin and Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew are independent in conduct, character and judgement and that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Independent Directors’ judgement. Each member of the NC will not be involved in the assessment or determination of his/her own independence.

# Provisions 2.2 and 2.3 – Proportion of Independent and Non-Executive Directors

The Directors have diverse experience such as legal, accounting, finance, business, management and industry knowledge. Accordingly, the NC and the Board are of the view that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional qualifications, age and gender on the Board, and is satisfied that the objectives of the Board Diversity Policy have been met. The NC will also continue to review the Board Diversity Policy, as appropriate, to ensure its effectiveness, and will recommend appropriate revisions to the Board for consideration and approval. Any further progress made towards the implementation of such policy will be disclosed, as appropriate.

Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is the Company’s Chairman and Managing Director. As at the date of this report, the Board comprises five (5) Directors, three (3) of whom are Independent and Non-Executive Directors. Accordingly, the Company complies with the relevant provisions of the Code 2018 which requires (i) independent directors to make up a majority of the Board where the Chairman of the Board is not independent, and (ii) non-executive directors to make up a majority of the Board.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 2.4 – Board Composition and Competency of the Board

As at the date of this report, the composition of the Board and each of the Board Committee are as follows:

|Name of Director|Designation|AC|NC|RC|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Datuk William Ng Yan Meng|Chairman and Managing Director|-|Member|-|
|Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung|Executive Director|-|-|-|
|Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin|Lead Independent Director|Member|Member|Chairman|
|Datuk Alexandra Chin|Independent Director|Chairman|-|Member|
|Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew|Independent Director|Member|Chairman|Member|

Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is currently the Chairman and Managing Director of the Company. The Company does not have a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Taking into account the current corporate structure, size, nature and scope of the Group’s operations, the Board is of the view that it is presently not necessary to separate the roles of the Chairman and Managing Director. With the AC and the RC consisting of all Non-Executive and Independent Directors, and the NC consisting majority of Non-Executive and Independent Directors, the Board believes that there are sufficient safeguards and checks to ensure that the process of decision-making by the Board is independent and based on collective decisions without any individual or group of individuals exercising any considerable concentration of power or influence.

The Board’s composition, size, balance and mix of skills, knowledge, experience and other aspects of diversity, and independence of each Independent Director are reviewed by the NC annually. The Board considers its present size and composition appropriate, taking into account the nature and scope of the Group’s operations, the skills and knowledge of the Directors.

The Directors have the right competencies and diversity of experience to enable them to engage in constructive debate and contribute effectively. All Board members bring their independent judgment, diversified knowledge and experience to bear on issues of strategy (including social and environmental issues), performance, resources and standards of conduct and ethics. Core competencies include accounting, legal, finance, business and management, industry knowledge, strategic planning, familiarity with regulatory and compliance requirements and knowledge of risk management. The Board members also collectively possess the necessary core competencies for an effective functioning of the Board.

The NC is of the view that the current Board comprises persons whose diverse skills, knowledge, experience and attributes provide for an effective Board. The Board will take into consideration the skill sets and experience including giving due consideration to the benefits of diversity when seeking to appoint candidates for any future Board appointments.

# Provision 2.5 – Meetings of Non-Executive and Independent Directors without Management

Although all the Directors have an equal responsibility for the Group’s operations, the role of the Independent Directors is particularly important in ensuring that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors and the Management are constructively challenged, fully discussed and examined.

As the Chairman and Managing Director, Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is responsible for:

1. leading the Board to ensure its effectiveness;
2. the business strategy and direction of the Group, implementation of the Group’s corporate plans and policies, and executive decision-making;
3. ensuring that the Board meetings are held when necessary;
4. scheduling and setting the Board’s agenda and ensuring adequate time for discussion;
5. promoting openness and discussion during Board meetings;
6. exercising control over the information flow between the Board and the Management by ensuring that the Board receives complete, adequate and timely information;
7. ensuring effective communication with the shareholders and other stakeholders;
8. encouraging constructive relations within the Board and the Management;
9. facilitating effective contributions of the Directors; and
10. promoting high standards of corporate governance.

Datuk William Ng Yan Meng is assisted by the Company Secretary at all the Board meetings. Where necessary, the auditors of the Company and other external consultants are invited to attend the Board meetings to assist the Directors in their deliberations.

As the Independent Directors make up a majority of the Board, the objectivity of such deliberations is assured. The Independent Directors constructively challenge and assist to develop both the Group’s short-term and long-term business strategies. The Management’s progress in implementing such agreed business strategies is monitored by the Independent Directors.

The Independent Directors would meet regularly, at least annually, without the presence of Management (including the Executive Directors), and this has been carried out in FY2023.

# Provision 3.3 – Lead Independent Director

As recommended by the Code 2018, the Board has appointed Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin as the Lead Independent Director of the Company, to provide leadership in circumstances where the Chairman is conflicted. Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin is available to shareholders should they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of communication with the Chairman and Managing Director or the Financial Controller are inappropriate or inadequate.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 3.3 – Lead Independent Director (cont’d)

Led by the Lead Independent Director, the Independent Directors will meet, where necessary, without the presence of the other Directors, and the Lead Independent Director will provide feedback to the Chairman and Managing Director and/or the Financial Controller after such meetings, as deemed appropriate.

# Provision 4.3 – Selection, Appointment and Re-appointment of Directors

The Board, through the delegation of its authority to the NC, has used its best efforts to ensure that Directors appointed to the Board possess the skills, experience and knowledge necessary for the Group’s businesses and each Director, through his/her contributions, brings to the Board an independent (when applicable) and objective perspective to enable balanced and well-considered decisions to be made.

# Board Membership

Principle 4: The board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the board.

# Provisions 4.1 and 4.2 – NC Composition, Role and Responsibilities

The NC comprises three (3) Directors, of which two (2) out of three (3) Directors are Independent Directors. The Lead Independent Director is also a member of the NC. The NC shall meet at least once a year. The members of the NC are as follows:

|Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew|(Chairman)|(Independent Director)|
|---|---|---|
|Datuk William Ng Yan Meng|(Member)|(Chairman and Managing Director)|
|Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin|(Member)|(Lead Independent Director)|

The NC is responsible for identifying candidates and reviewing all nominations for the appointments of new directors. When an existing director chooses to retire or the need for a new director arises, either to replace a retiring director or to enhance the Board’s strength, the NC, in consultation with the Board, evaluates and determines the selection criteria so as to identify candidates with the appropriate expertise and experience for the appointment as new director. The selection criterion includes integrity, diversity of competencies, expertise, industry experience and financial literacy. The NC seeks potential candidates widely and beyond the Directors/Management recommendations and is empowered to engage external parties, such as professional search firms and institutions, to undertake research on or assessment of candidates as it deems necessary. The NC then meets with the shortlisted potential candidates with the appropriate profile to assess suitability and to ensure that the candidates are aware of the expectation and the level of commitment required, before nominating the most suitable candidate to the Board for approval and appointment as director.

The role of the NC also includes the responsibility of reviewing the re-nomination of Directors who retire by rotation, taking into consideration the Director’s availability and responsiveness to ad-hoc queries and the quality of the responses received, the value that each Director brings to the Board, and whether his/her respective expertise and skillsets would result in a balanced Board with the range of experiences that would add value to the Company.

Apart from guidance under the Code 2018 and regulations under the Constitution, the NC also takes into consideration the individual contributions of each Director based on his/her respective areas of competence. These assessments are undertaken periodically both at formal meetings and in other discussions outside formal meetings.

The NC is responsible for:

- deciding how the performance of the Board, its Board Committees and Directors may be evaluated and proposing objective performance criteria;
- regularly reviewing the Board structure, size and composition and making recommendations to the Board with regards to any adjustments that are deemed necessary;
- reviewing the succession plans for Directors, in particular the appointment and/or replacement of the Chairman and Managing Director and key management personnel of the Company;
- identifying suitable candidates, reviewing and recommending all nominations on appointments and re-appointments of Directors, having regard to the Director’s contribution and performance including making recommendations on the composition of the Board and the balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors appointed to the Board;
- determining on an annual basis whether or not a Director is independent under the definitions set out in the Code 2018 and the Catalist Rules;
- reviewing induction programs for new Directors, as well as the training and professional development programs for the continuing training of the Directors;
- deciding whether a Director, who has multiple board representations, is able to and has adequately carried out his/her duties as a director.

The Constitution of the Company provides that at least one-third of its Directors shall retire from office and are subject to re-election at every AGM. All Directors shall submit themselves for re-nomination and re-election at regular intervals and at least once every three (3) years in accordance with Rule 720(4) of the Catalist Rules. In addition, the Constitution of the Company also provides that a newly appointed Director must submit himself/herself for re-election at the forthcoming AGM following his/her appointment.

Accordingly, Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew are due for retirement by rotation at the forthcoming AGM, pursuant to Regulation 100 of the Constitution of the Company. All of the retiring Directors have each consented to remain in office.

Datuk William Ng Yan Meng shall, upon re-election as Director of the Company, remain as the Chairman and Managing Director of the Company, and a member of the NC.

Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew shall, upon re-election as Director of the Company, remain as an Independent Director, the Chairman of the NC, and a member of the AC and the RC respectively.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 4.3 – Selection, Appointment and Re-appointment of Directors (cont’d)

The NC has recommended to the Board, and the Board has accepted the re-elections of Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Adj Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew as the Directors of the Company at the forthcoming AGM.

In making the above recommendations, the NC had considered the said Directors’ overall contribution and performance. Each member of the NC has abstained from recommending and voting on any resolutions in respect of his/her re-nomination as a Director of the Company.

Please refer to the Notice of AGM for the resolutions put forth on the Directors’ proposed re-election and re-appointment, as well as the detailed information on each Director as set out in the section entitled “Information on Directors Nominated for Re-election – Appendix 7F of the Catalist Rules” of this report.

# Provision 4.4 – Continuous Review of Directors’ Independence

The NC determines annually, and as and when circumstances require, whether a Director is independent, taking into consideration the disclosures by the Directors of any relationships with the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers, and the confirmation of independence form completed by each Independent Director to confirm his/her independence. Such form is drawn up based on Principle 2 of the Code 2018, the Practice Guidance as well as Rule 406(3)(d) of the Catalist Rules.

The NC has assessed the independence of the Directors and is satisfied that there are no relationships, which would deem any of the Independent Directors not to be independent. Each of the Independent Directors also confirmed that there are no other relationships (whether familial, business, financial, employment or otherwise) between him/her, and the Company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers.

The Board, with the concurrence of the NC, has also considered Ms Elaine Beh Pur-Lin, Datuk Alexandra Chin and Adj. Prof. Paul Chan Wan Siew to be independent for the purpose of Rule 704(7) of the Catalist Rules.

# Provision 4.5 – Multiple Listed Company Directorships and Other Principal Commitments

The Company does not have any alternate directors during FY2023. The Code 2018 and the Practice Guidance requires listed companies to fix the maximum number of board representations on other listed companies that their directors may hold and to disclose this in their annual report. The Board, with the concurrence of the NC, has agreed that the Directors shall not hold more than four (4) directorships in listed companies if they hold a full-time position or six (6) directorships in listed companies if they do not hold a full-time position. The number of external directorships in other listed companies outside of the Group concurrently held by the Executive Directors shall be limited to two (2). None of the Directors currently hold more directorships than this limit.

Despite this limit, the NC will continue to monitor and determine annually, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Directors have given sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company and adequately carry out his/her duties as a Director of the Company.

The assessment of the contribution by each Director is specifically related to the individual Director’s duties such as preparedness, contribution and industry and business knowledge and experience which are crucial to the Group’s business. The NC evaluates each Director’s performance based on the following review parameters, including but not limited to:

- board composition
- attendance at Board/Board Committee meetings;
- participation and contribution at Board/Board Committee meetings;
- availability for consultation and advice, when required;
- independence of the Directors (where applicable); and
- appropriate skill, experience and expertise.

Although the Board performance evaluation does not include a benchmark index of its industry peers and its share performance, the Board performance assessment is undertaken collectively and informally on a continual basis by the NC with input from the other Board members. The NC also takes into account the Board’s balance and mix in evaluating the performance and effectiveness of the Board as a whole. Factors taken into consideration for the assessment of the Board as a whole includes the contribution to the development of strategies and effective risk management, and response to problems and crisis. The assessment of the contribution of the Chairman encompasses effective leadership and communication with shareholders and the Board.

The NC has in place an annual Board performance evaluation exercise, which is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and facilitate discussion to enable Directors to discharge their duties more effectively. The evaluations are carried out by means of a questionnaire being completed by each Director. The results of the completed questionnaires are collated and the findings are analysed and discussed by the NC, with comparatives from the previous year’s results and reported to the Board.

The Board performance evaluation exercise provides an opportunity to obtain constructive feedback from each Director on whether the Board’s procedures and processes had allowed him/her to discharge his/her duties effectively. Directors are encouraged to propose changes to enhance effectiveness of the Board as a whole.

# Board Performance

# Principle 5:

The board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

# Provisions 5.1 and 5.2 – Board Evaluation Policy and Board Performance Criteria

The NC is responsible for deciding how the Board’s performance may be evaluated and proposing objective performance criteria for the Board’s approval and implementing corporate governance measures to achieve good stewardship of the Company. The NC has adopted processes for the evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the Board Committees and individual Directors, based on the performance criteria approved by the Board. The objective of the annual evaluation is to identify areas for improvement and thereafter implement appropriate action.

The Board evaluation questionnaire takes into consideration qualitative factors such as Board composition, information flow to the Board, Board process, Board accountability, matters concerning the Chairman and Managing Director and top management and standards of conduct of Board members. The NC would review the need to set quantitative targets as performance criteria when appropriate.

The performance criteria will not be changed from year to year unless circumstances deem it necessary for any of the criteria to be changed, for example to align with changes to the Code 2018 and the onus should be on the Board to justify the decision.

The NC also has an annual performance evaluation exercise for each of the Board Committees. The performance evaluations of the AC, NC and RC are similarly carried out with questionnaires. The results are collated and the findings are analysed and discussed by the NC, with comparatives from the previous year’s results, and reported to the Board.

Individual Director evaluations are also conducted whereby each Director is evaluated on his/her contributions through proper guidance, diligent oversight and able leadership, and the support extended to Management in steering the Group.

The results of the Board, Board Committees and Individual Director evaluations are compiled by the Company Secretary and reported to the NC. In discussing the results of the performance evaluations for FY2023, the Board and Board Committee members were able to identify areas for improving their effectiveness. No significant issues were identified in the results of the evaluations.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provisions 5.1 and 5.2 – Board Evaluation Policy and Board Performance Criteria (cont’d)

Following the review in FY2023, the Board is of the view that the Board and its Board Committees operate effectively and that each Director contributes to the overall effectiveness of the Board and its Board Committees.

There was no external consultant involved in the Board evaluation process in FY2023.

The NC will continue to review the formal assessment processes for evaluating Board performance, its Board Committees, as well as the contribution of individual Directors to the effectiveness of the Board. Each member of the NC shall abstain from any deliberation and voting on any resolutions in respect of his/her re-nomination and assessment as a Director.

# REMUNERATION MATTERS

# Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies

All aspects of remuneration, including but not limited to, Directors’ fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, share-based incentives and awards, and benefits-in-kind are reviewed by the RC. No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration. Each member of the RC shall abstain from voting on any resolution in respect of his/her remuneration package and making any recommendations and/or participating in any deliberations of the RC in respect of his/her remuneration package.

The Company’s obligations arising in the event of termination of service contracts of its Executive Directors and key management personnel are contained in their respective employment letters. The RC is satisfied that such contracts of service provide for fair and reasonable termination clauses, applicable to the respective employment class and are not overly generous.

# Provision 6.4 – Remuneration Consultant

# Principle 6:

The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors and key management personnel. No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

# Provisions 6.1 and 6.2 – RC Composition, Role and Responsibilities

The RC has the right to seek professional advice relating to the remuneration of all Directors and key management personnel. The RC would ensure that any relationship between the appointed remuneration consultant and the Company, any of the Directors and key management personnel will not affect the independence and objectivity of the remuneration consultant.

# Level and Mix of Remuneration

# Principle 7:

The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and key management personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the Company.

# Provision 7.1 – Remuneration of Executive Directors and Key Management Personnel

The responsibilities of the RC are:

- to review and recommend to the Board the framework and policies of remuneration for Directors and key management personnel. The RC’s recommendations are made in consultation with the Chairman and Managing Director and submitted for endorsement by the entire Board. The review covers all aspects of remuneration, including but not limited to Directors’ fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, share-based incentives and awards, and benefits-in-kind, of the Directors and key management personnel;
- to review and recommend to the Board the terms of the service agreements of the Executive Directors;
- to determine the specific remuneration packages for each key management personnel based on performance, length of service, seniority, experience and scope of responsibility;

The remuneration policy of the Group is to provide compensation packages at market rates that reward good performance and attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors and key management personnel.

The Group’s remuneration policy comprises a fixed component and a variable component. The fixed component is in the form of fixed monthly salary or allowance whereas the variable component is linked to the performance of the Group and individual. The variable component is designed to align the interests of such Executive Directors and key management personnel with those of the shareholders of the Company.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 7.1 – Remuneration of Executive Directors and Key Management Personnel (cont’d)

The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and key management personnel are based on service contracts. Datuk William Ng Yan Meng, the Chairman and Managing Director of the Company, and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung, Executive Director, each have a service agreement with the Company for an initial period of three (3) years with effect from 30 September 2021. For further information on the remuneration of Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung, please refer to the section entitled “Directors, Executive Officer and Staff - Service Agreements” of the offer document dated 14 September 2021 (the “Offer Document”) for the Listing.

Independent and Non-Executive Directors are paid annually and such fees, being an agreed amount, are subject to shareholders’ approval at the AGM. The proposed Directors’ fees are determined in accordance with their contributions, taking into account factors such as effort, time spent and responsibilities of the Directors. The Non-Executive Directors shall not be over-compensated to the extent that their independence may be compromised.

In setting remuneration packages, the RC ensures that the Executive Directors and key management personnel are adequately but not excessively remunerated as compared to the industry and other comparable companies. The remuneration packages comprise a basic salary component and a variable component, which is a performance bonus, and/or share-based incentives, based on the performance of the Group as a whole and/or their individual performance. The performance bonus and/or shares-based incentives for the Executive Directors and key management personnel are recommended by the RC and subject to approval by the Board, which is based on quantitative criteria (including revenue, profit after tax and/or relative financial performance of the Group to its peers).

The Company has adopted a performance share plan known as the “Shared Purpose and Prosperity Incentive Plan” (“SPRINT”) and a share option scheme known as the “Group Employee Share Option Scheme” (“Group ESOS”). Both the SPRINT and the Group ESOS provide eligible participants with an opportunity to participate in the equity of the Company, to motivate them towards better performance through increased dedication and loyalty, to ensure alignment of interests with those of shareholders, and to promote the long-term success of the Group. Both the SPRINT and the Group ESOS form an integral and important component of the compensation plan and are designed primarily to reward and retain employees whose services are vital to the growth and performance of the Company and the Group. As at the date of this report, no options have been granted under the Group ESOS. As at the date of this report, the Company has granted 3,300,000 awards (“Awards”) of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, to be vested in three tranches under the SPRINT, and 1,100,000 new shares have been allotted and issued by the Company pursuant to the vesting of these Awards.

During FY2023, except for the SPRINT and the Group ESOS, the Company does not have any material long-term incentive benefits involving the grant of awards or options or any other form of deferred remuneration, which needs to be accrued.

The Company does not currently use contractual provisions to allow the Company to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from the Executive Directors and key management personnel in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial results, or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Company.

# Provision 7.3 – Attract, Retain and Motivate Directors and Key Management Personnel

As described above, the Group maintains a framework of remuneration for the Board and key management personnel to ensure fair and competitive remuneration packages.

# Disclosure on Remuneration

Principle 8: The company is transparent on its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation.

The RC has reviewed and approved the remuneration packages of the Directors and key management personnel having due regard to their contributions as well as the financial capabilities of the Company. The Directors and key management personnel are paid based on a fixed schedule of fees and remuneration (including base salary, fixed allowances and benefits, and bonus) respectively.

During FY2023, there were no termination, retirement and post-employment benefits granted to the Directors or the key management personnel.

# Provision 8.1(a) – Directors’ Remuneration

The Executive Directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Company, and hence, the Company should be able to avail itself of remedies against the Executive Directors in the event of such breach of fiduciary duties. Similarly, for the key management personnel, the Company believes that there are alternative legal avenues to specific contractual provisions that will enable the Company to recover financial losses arising from exceptional circumstances above from the key management personnel.

The RC will review such contractual provisions with the Executive Directors and key management personnel as and when necessary.

The Company has disclosed the remuneration of the Directors in bands of S$250,000 which would provide a good overview and is informative of the remuneration of each Director. The Company is of the view that due to confidentiality and sensitivity attached to remuneration matters, it would not be in the best interests of the Company to disclose the exact details of the remuneration of the Directors.

In arriving at this decision, the Board had taken into consideration, inter alia, the commercial sensitivity and confidential nature of remuneration matters, the relative size of the Group, the competitive business environment in which the Group operates, and the need of the Group to attract and retain talent at the Board level on a long-term basis.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 8.1(a) – Directors’ Remuneration (cont’d)

*Amount inclusive of contributions to Employees Provident Fund

# Share awards granted under SPRINT will vest equally over three tranches in April 2023, 2024 and 2025 based on achievement of the pre-determined financial performance targets.

^ Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung were awarded and issued, 600,000 shares and 400,000 shares in the Company respectively in FY2023. Both Executive Directors do not receive any directors’ fees in relation to their directorships in the Company and its subsidiaries.

The RC has recommended that the Independent Directors to be paid Directors’ fee of S$54,000 for the financial year ending 31 December 2024 (“FY2024”), which are to be paid half yearly in arrears. The aforementioned Directors’ fees will be tabled at the forthcoming AGM for approval by the Company’s shareholders.

# Provision 8.1(b) – Remuneration of Key Management Personnel

In FY2023, the Company has only one (1) key management personnel (who is not a Director), being the Financial Controller of the Company. The aggregate remuneration paid to him is less than S$250,000, and the breakdown of his remuneration (in percentage terms) for base salary, Awards under the SPRINT, variable or performance related income/bonus, and allowances are 52.3%, 31.5%, 8.5% and 7.7% respectively.

The Board believes that disclosure of the remuneration of the key management personnel as recommended by the Code 2018 would be disadvantageous to the business interest of the Company, in view of the sensitive nature of such information and high competition for talent.

Group employees who have attained the age of twenty-one (21) years and hold such rank as may be designated by the RC from time to time and who have been in full-time employment of the Group for a period of at least twelve (12) months (or in the case of Executive Directors, such shorter period as the RC may determine), and Non-Executive Directors (including the Independent Directors) of the Group who have attained the age of twenty-one (21) years and are not undischarged bankrupts and have not entered into a composition with their respective creditors, shall be eligible to participate in SPRINT.

Controlling shareholders of the Company or associates of such controlling shareholders are eligible to participate in SPRINT if their participation and awards are approved by independent shareholders in separate resolutions for each such person and for each such award.

The number of shares which are the subject of each award to be granted to a participant in accordance with SPRINT shall be determined at the absolute discretion of the RC, which shall take into account criteria as it considers fit, such as (but not limited to) his rank, job performance, years of service, potential for future development, his contribution to the success and development of the Group and the extent of effort and resourcefulness with which the performance condition may be achieved within the performance period. The performance condition will be set by the RC.

The Company has granted an aggregate of 3,000,000 Awards to Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung, both being controlling shareholders of the Company, to be vested in three equal tranches in April 2023, 2024 and 2025 based on the achievement of pre-determined financial performance targets pursuant to SPRINT. As disclosed in the Company’s announcement dated 2 May 2023, a total of 1,000,000 new shares have been allotted and issued by the Company to Datuk William Ng Yan Meng and Dato’ Ryan Ooi Keim Fung pursuant to the vesting of the Awards under SPRINT in FY2023. The information prescribed under Rule 851(1) of the Catalist Rules for participants who are directors of the Company, or controlling shareholders of the Company and their associates is disclosed in the Directors’ Statement on page 102 of this annual report. There are no participants (other than the directors of the Company or participants who are controlling shareholders of the Company and their associates) who receive 5% or more of the total number of Awards available under the SPRINT.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# Provision 8.3 – Employee Share Schemes and Executive Performance Conditions (cont’d)

# Provision 9.1 – Risk Management and Internal Control Systems

# Group ESOS

Under the Group ESOS, the aggregate number of new shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the scheme (including options granted under the scheme and all outstanding options or awards granted under such other share-based incentive schemes of the Company) shall not at any time exceed fifteen per cent (15%) of the issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) on the date preceding the grant of the option.

Under the rules of the Group ESOS, Group employees who have attained the age of twenty one (21) years on or prior to the offer date and who have, as of the date of grant, been in the Group’s employment for at least twelve (12) months (or such shorter period as the RC may determine) and Non-Executive Directors (including Independent Directors) of the Group who have attained the age of twenty one (21) years on or prior to the offer date, shall be eligible to participate in the Group ESOS, provided that none of them shall be an undischarged bankrupt or have entered into a composition with his creditors.

The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk. The Management is responsible to the Board for the design, implementation and monitoring of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems and to provide the Board with the basis to determine the Company’s levels of risk tolerance and risk policies.

The Company has clear policies and guidelines from dealings in securities by Directors and employees. The Company imposes a trading embargo on its Directors and employees from trading in its securities for the period of one (1) month before the announcement of its half-yearly and full-year financial results.

The Board notes that all internal control systems contain inherent limitations and no sound system of internal controls could provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgment in decision making, human error losses, fraud or other irregularities. However, alternative procedures, policies, guidelines and compliance regulations are in place to mitigate any possible and/or suspected irregularities.

Controlling shareholders of the Company or associates of such controlling shareholders who satisfy the above criteria are eligible to participate in the Group ESOS if their participation and the actual or maximum number of shares and terms of any options to be granted to them are approved by independent Shareholders in separate resolutions for each such person and for each such grant of options.

The Group ESOS shall be administered by the RC in its absolute discretion and with such powers or duties as conferred on it by the Board. The aggregate number of shares comprised in any option to be offered to a grantee shall be determined at the absolute discretion of the RC, which shall take into account criteria such as rank, past performance, years of service, contribution to the success and development of the Group, and potential development of that grantee.

Under the rules of the Group ESOS, there are no fixed periods for the grant of options. As such, offers of the grant of options may be made at any time from time to time at the discretion of the RC. However, no option shall be granted during the period of thirty (30) days immediately preceding the date of announcement of the Company’s interim or final results (as the case may be). In addition, in the event that an announcement on any matter of an exceptional nature involving unpublished price and/or trade sensitive information is imminent, offers may only be made on or after the third market day from the date on which the aforesaid announcement is released.

As the Company does not have a separate risk management committee, the AC and the Management assume the responsibility of the risk management function. The AC and Management review the Company’s business and operational activities regularly to identify areas of significant risks as well as appropriate measures to control and mitigate these risks. The AC and Management review and highlight all significant matters in relation to risk management and framework to the Board. Having considered the Company’s business and operations as well as its existing internal control and risk management systems, the Board is of the view that a separate risk management committee is not required for the time being.

# Provision 9.2 – Board’s Comments on Adequacy and Effectiveness of Risk Management and Internal Control Systems

No options have been granted pursuant to the Group ESOS since its commencement.

For FY2023, the Board had received assurance from the Chairman and Managing Director, and the Financial Controller that the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Company’s operations and finances, and the Company’s risk management and internal control systems were adequate and effective to address financial, operational, information technology and compliance risks.

In FY2023, the Group’s external auditors (to the extent as required by them to form an audit opinion on the statutory financial statements) and internal auditors conducted a review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal control system and risk management system. Findings and recommendations for improvement were reported to the AC.

# Risk Management and Internal Control Systems

Principle 9: The board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

The AC also enquires and relies on reviews by the Management and the reports from the internal auditors and the external auditors on any material weaknesses in internal controls. The AC oversees and monitors the implementation of any improvements thereto.

The AC had reviewed with the Management, the internal auditors and the external auditors’ findings of the existence and adequacy of material accounting controls procedures as part of its audit for the financial year under review. The AC is of the view that the works carried out by the Management, the internal auditors and the external auditors are adequate.

Based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by the internal and external auditors, the assurance received from the Chairman and Managing Director and the Financial Controller, and reviews performed by the Management, the AC and the Board are of the opinion that the Group’s internal controls, addressing financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks, and its risk management systems were adequate and effective in FY2023 to address the risks the Group considers material to its business operations.

The AC and the Board will continue to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and risk management system on an on-going basis.

The AC has been given full access to Management and has reasonable resources to discharge its function properly. The AC has full discretion to invite any Director or Executive Director or executive officer to attend its meetings.

The number of meetings convened by the AC is set out in Provision 1.5 of this report. The Directors and the Company Secretary are invited to these meetings. Minutes of the AC meetings are submitted to the Board for information and review with such recommendations as the AC considers appropriate.

In reviewing and assessing the independence of the external auditors, the AC reviewed the fees and expenses paid to the external auditors, including fees paid for non-audit services during the year. A breakdown of the audit and non-audit fees paid to the Company’s auditors are disclosed on page 121 of this Annual Report. The aggregate amount of audit fees and non-audit fees paid or payable by the Group to the external auditors of the Company for FY2023 amounted to S$68,803 for audit services and S$4,400 for non-audit services and the aggregate amount of fees paid or payable to the external auditors of the Company’s subsidiaries for FY2023 amounted to S$21,543 for audit services and S$7,941 for non-audit services. The AC is satisfied that the nature and extent of such non-audit services would not prejudice the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.

The AC recommends to the Board on the proposals to the shareholders on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of external auditor and approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor. After considering the resources and experience of Baker Tilly and the audit partner-in-charge assigned to the audit, Baker Tilly’s other audit engagements, the size and complexity of the audit of the Group, as well as the number and experience of the staff assigned by Baker Tilly for the audit, the AC has recommended to the Board, the nomination and re-appointment of Baker Tilly as the external auditor for the Company’s audit obligations for FY2024, at the forthcoming AGM.

The Group confirms that it has complied with Rules 712 and 715 of the Catalist Rules in appointing audit firms for the Group. Having reviewed Baker Tilly’s independence, the AC has recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Baker Tilly as the external auditors of the Group at the forthcoming AGM.

The Constitution provides that a member may appoint not more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote at general meetings in his/her stead. The Constitution allows for absentia voting subject to Directors’ approval and implementation. However, due to security issues including but not limited to the authentication of shareholder identity information, the Directors have not approved the implementation of absentia voting. Voting in absentia and by electronic mail may only be possible following careful study to ensure that integrity of the information and authentication of the identity of shareholders through the web is not compromised. An exception is made for the forthcoming AGM to be held in respect of FY2023, at which shareholders shall be allowed to submit their proxy forms via electronic means.

In order to have a valid registration of proxy, an instrument appointing a proxy must be deposited at such place or places specified in the notice convening the general meetings at least seventy-two (72) hours before the time appointed for the general meetings.

# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED

# Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Audience Analytics Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as set out on pages 108 to 143, which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group and the statement of changes in equity of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2023 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and of the changes in equity of the Company for the financial year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Revenue recognition

The procedures performed by us and the component auditors to address the key audit matter:

We obtained an understanding of the Group’s accounting policies on revenue recognition and evaluated appropriateness of those revenue recognition policies. We performed test of design and implementation of the relevant key internal controls and test of effectiveness of the controls for revenue recognition processes.

We agreed samples of sale invoices issued to details of contractual terms signed with customers, checked the delivery of performance obligations to relevant supporting sources and documents and calculations of corresponding contract liability and revenue recognised in the Group’s financial records.

We also assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures made in the financial statements.

# Other Information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

The Group recognised revenue of $14,629,949 during the financial year. Revenue is one of the key elements in the financial statements used as a measure of financial performance of an entity and the revenue recognition accounting policies adopted by the Group vary depending on the nature of the respective revenue stream and the contractual terms with the customers.

Revenue recognition is considered a key audit matter due to the significance of revenue from business impact assessment and recognition segment to the financial statements which accounted for $13,448,906 of the Group’s revenue of $14,629,949 and the time and audit effort required to review management’s tracking on the delivery of performance obligations under the varying contractual terms with customers in determining the timing of the revenue to be recognised.

# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF AUDIENCE ANALYTICS LIMITED

# Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Sek See Mun.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the financial year ended 31 December 2023

These notes form an integral part of and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.

# 1 Corporate information

Audience Analytics Pte. Ltd. (the “Company”) (Co. Reg. No. 202113626W) was incorporated in Singapore on 16 April 2021 for the purpose of acquiring the existing companies pursuant to the restructuring exercise on the preparation of the listing of the Company. On 23 July 2021, the Company was converted into a public company limited by shares and changed its name to Audience Analytics Limited.

The registered office and principal place of business of the Company is at 138 Robinson Road, #26-03 Oxley Tower Singapore 068906. The Company is listed on Catalist of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) on 30 September 2021.

The principal activity of the Company is that of investment holding. The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements.

# New and revised standards that are adopted

In the current financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) Interpretations (“SFRS(I) INT”) that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current financial year. Changes to the Group’s accounting policies have been made as required, in accordance with the transitional provisions in the respective SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT.

The adoption of these new/revised SFRS(I) and SFRS(I) INT did not have any material effect on the financial results or position of the Group and the Company except as disclosed below:

Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies

The immediate and ultimate holding company is Bain Equity Sdn. Bhd, which is incorporated in Malaysia. The amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements provide guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments require entities to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies, and provide guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

# 2 Material accounting policies

# a) Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Group are presented in Singapore Dollar (“$”), which is the Company’s functional currency. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.

The Group has adopted the amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 on disclosures of accounting policies. The amendments have no impact on the measurement, recognition and presentation of any items in the Group’s and the Company’s financial statements.

# New and revised standards not yet effective

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial years. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions and historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.

New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that have been issued at the end of the reporting period but are not yet effective for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Group and the Company.

# b) Revenue recognition

Use of estimates and judgements Revenue from business impact assessment and recognition

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

The areas involving a higher degree of judgement in applying accounting policies, or areas where assumptions and estimates have a significant risk of resulting in material adjustment within next financial year are disclosed in Note 2(f) to the financial statements.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables and payables (other than lease liabilities) approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

The Group conducts business impact assessments on companies nominated for its business recognition awards. The Group generates revenue primarily through “nomination fee” from applicants to participate in the awards and the sale of awards packages to participants who had won the awards. Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation (“PO”) by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. Nomination fee is recognised at the point in time upon the completion of assessment exercise and when the results are announced to the applicants. Revenue from sale of awards packages is recognised at the point in time when the awards ceremonies are held where the items within the packages are delivered to customer with minimal unfulfilled obligations. These remaining unfulfilled obligations will be satisfied in the following year and recognised as revenue upon fulfilments.

# 2 Material accounting policies (cont’d)

# b) Revenue recognition (cont’d)

Revenue from business impact assessment and recognition (cont’d)

The Group uses an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price for separate performance obligations or develop a stand-alone price based on their best estimation of the customer perceived value that reinforces the premium image of their awards and the services when an observable price is not available.

Revenue from business media (cont’d)

In addition, the Group provides advertorial production and advertisement placement services in the Group’s magazines. The Group transfers control and recognises a sale at the point in time when the advertorials and advertisement are published (defined as an issue’s on-sale date). A contract liability is recognised when the Group has not yet performed under the contract but bills customers in advance or receives advanced payments from the customer.

A contract liability is recognised when the Group has not yet performed the services under the contract but bills customers in advance or receives advanced payments from the customer. A receivable is recognised when the Group has a present right to payment in accordance with the contractual terms with customers. Customers are required to pay upon signing of contract.

Costs to fulfil a contract are capitalised if the costs relate directly to the contract, generate or enhance resources used in satisfying the contract and are expected to be recovered. Other contract costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalised contract costs are subsequently charged to profit or loss as cost of sales on a basis consistent with the pattern of recognition of the associated revenue.

For performance obligations related to sales of magazines, the Group recognises revenue when each magazine issue is mailed or sold to the customer.

A receivable is recognised when the Group has a present right to payment in accordance with the contractual terms with customers. Customers are required to pay upon signing of contract. No element of financing is deemed present as the expected length of time between when the Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be one year or less.

# c) Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements

Revenue from exhibitions

The Group identifies optimum exhibition dates, secures venues, organises exhibitions for its customers. Revenue is derived from rental of exhibition booths and space to exhibitors. Revenue is recognised over the period of the exhibitions based on the number of days which the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits from the services provided by the Group. The Group bills the customer in accordance with the billing term in the contract. A contract liability is recognised when the Group has not yet performed under the contract but bills customers in advance or receives advanced payments from the customer. A receivable is recognised when the Group has a present right to payment in accordance with the contractual terms with customers. Customers are required to pay upon signing of contract. No element of financing is deemed present as the expected length of time between when the Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be one year or less.

Costs to fulfil a contract are capitalised if the costs relate directly to the contract, generate or enhance resources used in satisfying the contract and are expected to be recovered. Other contract costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalised contract costs are subsequently charged to profit or loss as cost of sales on a basis consistent with the pattern of recognition of the associated revenue.

Revenue from business media

The Group organises and manages networking events and forums. The Group generates revenue through the sale of event sponsorship packages. Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation (“PO”) by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. Revenue is recognised at the point in time when the networking events and forums are held where the items within the packages are delivered to customer with no unfulfilled obligation.

The consolidated financial statements comprised the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the reporting date. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.

Intragroup balances and transactions, including income, expenses and dividends, are eliminated in full. Profits and losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are eliminated in full.

Business combinations involving entities under common control

Business combinations involving entities under common control are accounted for by applying the pooling of interest method.

Under this method, the Company has been treated as the holding company of the subsidiaries for the financial years presented rather than from the completion of the restructuring exercise on the preparation of the listing of the Company on SGX-ST. Accordingly, the results of the Group included the results of the subsidiaries for the entire periods under review. Such manner of presentation reflects the economic substance of the companies, which were under common control throughout the relevant period, as a single economic enterprise, although the legal parent-subsidiary relationships were not established.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# For the financial year ended 31 December 2023

# 2 Material accounting policies (cont’d)

# c) Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements (cont’d)

Business combinations involving entities under common control (cont’d)

Pursuant to this:

- Assets and liabilities are reflected at their existing carrying amounts;
- No adjustments are made to reflect the fair values on the date of combination or recognise any new assets or liabilities;
- No additional goodwill is recognised as a result of the combination;
- Prior to the issue of shares by the Company in connection with the restructuring exercise, the aggregate equity of the subsidiaries held directly by the Company is shown as the Group’s equity for financial years under review; and
- Upon the completion of the restructuring exercise, any difference between the consideration paid by the Company and the equity ‘acquired’ is reflected within the equity of the Group as merger reserve.

# d) Property, plant and equipment

# Income taxes

The amount and timing of taxable income and deductibility of certain expenditure is subject to the interpretation of complex tax regulations. Accordingly, there are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amounts of the Group’s income tax payables and deferred tax assets were $624,844 (2022: $1,063,328) and $41,198 (2022: $72,607) respectively.

# Depreciation

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the depreciable amounts of the property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|Years| |
|---|---|
|Computers and office equipment|5 to 10|
|Furniture and fittings|5 to 10|
|Renovation|10|
|Motor vehicle|5|
|Billboard|5|

The residual values, estimated useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date. The effects of any revision are recognised in profit or loss when the changes arise. Fully depreciated assets are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use.

# e) Employee benefits

# Share-based compensation

Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share options as consideration for services rendered. The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the options granted on the date of the grant. This cost is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in the share option reserve, over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are included in the estimation of the number of shares under options that are expected to become exercisable on the vesting date. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares under options that are expected to become exercisable on the vesting date and recognises the impact of the revision of the estimates in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to the share option reserve over the remaining vesting period.

At 31 December 2023, the Group has unutilised tax losses of $Nil (2022: $377,000) that are available for carry forward to offset against future taxable income.

The availability of unused tax losses for offsetting against future taxable profits of a subsidiary in Malaysia is subject to requirements and guidelines issued by the tax authority of Malaysia. These tax losses have been fully utilised during the year.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses of $Nil (2022: $Nil). No deferred tax assets has been recognised in respect of the remaining $Nil (2022: $377,000) losses as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be sufficient to allow the related tax benefits to be realised.

The Group does not have significant credit exposure except that the Group’s trade receivables comprise 1 debtor (2022: 1 debtor) that individually represented 7% (2022: 26%) of the trade receivables. As the Group does not hold any collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of each class of financial instruments presented on the statements of financial positions.

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. For receivables, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history, and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate to mitigate credit risk. For other financial assets, the Group adopts the policy of dealing only with high credit quality counterparties.

|Description of evaluation of financial assets|Basis for recognition and measurement of ECL|
|---|---|
|Counterparty has a low risk of default and does not have any past due amounts|12-month ECL|
|Contractual payments are more than 30 days past due or where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition|Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired|
|Contractual payments are more than 365 days past due or there is evidence of credit impairment|Lifetime ECL - credit-impaired|
|There is evidence indicating that the Group has no reasonable expectation of recovery of payments such as when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings|Write-off|

# Interest rate risk

The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk are restricted to their interest-bearing bank balances and fixed deposits as disclosed in Notes 16 to the financial statements respectively. No interest rate sensitivity was performed since the Group’s exposure to interest rate is not significant.

# 25 Financial instruments (cont’d)

# b) Financial risk management (cont’d)

# Credit risk (cont’d)

# Significant increase in credit risk (cont’d)

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.

Regardless of the evaluation of the above factors, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

The Group also assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial asset is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if it has an internal or external credit rating of “investment grade” as per globally understood definition, or the financial asset has a low risk of default; the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term; and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.

# Definition of default

The Group has determined the default events on a financial asset to be when there is evidence that the borrower is experiencing liquidity issues or when there is a breach of contract, such as a default of payment.

The Group considers the above as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable.

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 365 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

# Credit-impaired financial assets

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred, such as evidence that the borrower is in significant financial difficulty, there is a breach of contract such as default or past due event; there is information that it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.

# Estimation techniques and significant assumptions

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current financial year for recognition and measurement of credit loss allowances.

# Non-trade amount due from subsidiaries

For the non-trade amount due from subsidiaries where impairment loss allowance is measured using 12 months ECL, the Company assessed the latest performance and financial position of the respective counterparties, and concluded that there has been no significant increase in the credit risk since the initial recognition of the financial assets. Accordingly, the Company measured the impairment loss allowance using 12-month ECL and determined that the ECL is insignificant.

The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
