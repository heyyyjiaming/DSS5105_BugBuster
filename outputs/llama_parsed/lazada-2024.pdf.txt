# LETTER FROM GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Dear Stakeholders,

In an era marked by economic shifts, climate challenges, and evolving regulations, embracing change and innovation is crucial for sustained success. For Lazada, these principles are not just responses to an ever-changing environment, but core aspects of our resilient and sustainable business model. We are confident that digital commerce will remain a strong growth driver in this region.

The theme for our FY2024 ESG Impact Report, our third voluntary edition, is “Accelerating Innovation, Anchoring Resilience.” It highlights the role of innovation in our development. Innovation is not new to Lazada; for over a decade, we have been investing in technology and our payments and logistics infrastructure. These investments help us set new standards in the digital commerce industry, supporting responsible and sustainable growth.

# Our Achievements

Our commitment to empowering brands and enriching customer experiences in Southeast Asia drives us forward. Understanding consumer needs is paramount to our ability to consistently deliver impactful offerings. In 2023, we introduced various user-centric enhancements through the applications of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR). We launched our Lazada Skin Technology and the first-of-its-kind LazzieChat chatbot powered by Open AI ChatGPT technology to improve customer shopping experience. These solidify our dedication to innovation and our Customer-First culture.

We are also steadily advancing sustainability within our company and ecosystem. We are proud to be the first Southeast Asian digital commerce platform to offer dedicated sustainability education to our seller community through the Lazada Sustainability Academy, equipping small and medium-sized businesses with the tools they need to thrive in a sustainable future. We are also committed to fostering a sustainability-conscious workforce through our “ESG Essentials for Lazadians” internal training program.

Actively managing our carbon footprint is a priority and one we address by leveraging technology and our partner network. A significant milestone was Thailand’s first environmentally friendly distribution center, the Tha Raeng – Ram Inthra Logistics Hub, made possible through innovative partnerships. Our employees are the biggest contributors to Lazada’s success. Their unwavering dedication has enabled our business to remain resilient amid necessary adaptations to the wider business environment. We remain committed to supporting our Lazadian community, ensuring that everyone feels valued and motivated. Looking beyond Lazada, we are investing in the future by sharing our expertise and resources with schools and youths, building the digital workforce of tomorrow.

Last but not least, strong governance practices are central to our operations. We remain committed to building a trusted and safe platform and upholding the highest standards of conduct, reflecting our responsibility to stakeholders and the communities we serve.

# Our Journey Ahead

Looking ahead, we aim to further our ESG commitments and build a truly sustainable business. Our confidence in Lazada’s future stems from our commitment to adaptation and resilience. We remain focused on creating value for our stakeholders, driving economic prosperity, and fostering sustainable development across the markets we serve.

This Impact Report celebrates our collective achievements and outlines our ongoing ESG commitments for the road ahead. There is still much more to be done. We invite you, our valued stakeholders, to partner us as we continuously innovate and drive positive change for our customers, partners, employees, and the broader community.

Thank you for your unwavering support and trust. Together, let’s build a resilient and prosperous future for all.

FY2024 ESG Impact Report

# 5 QUESTIONS WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT

How is Lazada fostering collaboration in its ESG management practices? As a leading digital commerce company, we hold ambitious sustainability goals. At the same time, we understand that these can only be meaningfully achieved through collective action with like-minded partners.

# Frank Luo

Chief Finance Officer, Lazada Group

Collaboration at Lazada is more than just a buzzword; it is the very foundation of our success. This naturally extends to our ESG management practices, which encompass a wide range of ESG initiatives. Similar to our approach in other areas of our business, our ESG management hinges on partnering with high-caliber individuals and organizations that share our values. We seek like-minded partners who, like us, embrace optimism and a shared mission: to accelerate progress in Southeast Asia through technology and commerce. Through these partnerships, we leverage combined expertise and resources to drive meaningful change. Collaboration strengthens our ESG efforts in three key ways:

# Knowledge Sharing

Partnerships allow us to learn from others’ expertise and share our best practices. For example, in Indonesia, we partnered with the West Java Ministry of Education to train vocational high school teachers. This initiative leverages our knowledge and experience to not only share best practices but also gain valuable insights from educators.

# Collective Action

Collaboration allows us to tackle broader sustainability challenges that a single entity cannot address alone. In Thailand, we partnered with AIS, a leading mobile phone operator, to educate and encourage shoppers on e-waste disposal. This collaboration amplified our impact, promoting responsible waste management across a wider audience.

# Innovation

Collaboration fosters a breeding ground for innovation. Throughout the year, we worked with various partners to explore new solutions. This includes developing LazzieChat, the first digital commerce AI chatbot in Southeast Asia, a project that combines Microsoft Azure’s OpenAI service with Lazada’s extensive consumer reach.

There will be challenges along the way, which is why we believe in being transparent with our commitments and keeping ourselves accountable by tracking our progress. Our voluntary reports go beyond just listing our accomplishments to do just that. Given our extensive reach, we also see opportunities where we can bring others along on this sustainability journey as well and have undertaken efforts to educate our sellers, buyers, and partners. One example is the Lazada Sustainability Academy, which equips sellers with the knowledge and tools to operate sustainably, empowering them to go beyond performative actions and contribute to a genuinely sustainable digital commerce ecosystem.

# Gladys Chun

General Counsel, Lazada Group

With sustainability becoming a financial foundation for companies in 2024, what is Lazada’s approach towards integrating sustainability into its financial strategy?

We recognize that sustainability and financial stability are fundamentally intertwined, making it imperative to integrate ESG considerations into our financial strategy for long-term success. At Lazada, our approach is multi-pronged: climate change and ESG issues pose significant financial risks to businesses globally, so we have proactively included ESG considerations in our financial planning and risk assessments. Additionally, we are exploring how our financial decisions can support sustainable growth, enhance resilience, and drive innovation. By focusing on strategic long-term investments in sustainable facilities and product lines within the rapidly evolving digital commerce landscape, we aim to create long-term value for Lazada and our stakeholders, demonstrating that sustainable practices are not only beneficial for the planet but also smart business decisions.

# How is Lazada addressing the issue of greenwashing and assessing vulnerability to greenwashing claims?

We are actively combating greenwashing and like I mentioned before, transparency and accountability are fundamental to our sustainability efforts. The recent development of global disclosure standards, like those from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), is a positive step. These standards provide a unified framework for reference as we continue to refine our reporting practices. By actively studying these emerging best practices, we aim to enhance the communication of our sustainability efforts to stakeholders. This will ensure our disclosures not only align with the evolving regulatory landscape but also foster a deeper understanding of how sustainability is integrated into our financial strategy. Ultimately, our commitment to open communication strengthens engagement with investors, regulators, and the public, allowing us to work collaboratively towards a more sustainable future.

# How is Lazada integrating technology into its ESG strategy and what are the anticipated benefits?

We prioritize data-driven decisions in our ESG strategy. In 2023, we developed our own in-house carbon data collection platform to track Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and are in the process of expanding our platform to track Scope 3 emissions, water, waste, and electricity data. This platform leverages our advanced in-house technological capabilities to provide an end-to-end data tracking platform for Lazada to measure its performance and make informed decisions. Our in-house platform is continuously being refined to close data gaps and improve accuracy. For example, enhanced data management allowed Lazada to switch from calculating carbon emissions based on estimates to using actual business activity data. This shift provides more precise and accurate information for emissions management and progress tracking.

These six material topics were selected via a comprehensive materiality assessment conducted by an independent consultant, to understand the ESG issues most significant to our business and stakeholders. Through a rigorous three-stage process, we prioritized and validated the top six topics according to the double materiality concept, evaluating their impact on our enterprise value and our assessed impact on society and the environment.

26 material issues were identified by reviewing industry trends, peer benchmarking, and international standards like GRI and SASB.

Surveys and interviews with internal and external stakeholders assessed the impact of each shortlisted material issue, capturing their views on related risks and opportunities.

Across Southeast Asia, the digital economy is poised for impressive growth, with projections reaching US$600 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV)6 by 2030 and eCommerce driving much of this growth, estimated to grow to US$295 billion by 7 2025. As the region’s leading digital commerce platform, Lazada is committed to playing a pivotal role in this expansion. We are collaborating with governments and enterprises to build a high-quality digital ecosystem that offers rewarding employment opportunities, innovative services, and capacity-building initiatives in the communities across the six Southeast Asian markets we serve.

Despite the promising growth potential, challenges remain in promoting inclusive and sustainable economic development.8 One major hurdle is bridging the digital divide and ensuring inclusive access to the digital economy. At Lazada, we focus on fostering a prosperous environment that empowers stakeholders in our ecosystem to adopt new technology and innovations, enabling them to actively participate and benefit from the digital landscape. By driving innovation within our ecosystem, supporting local businesses to thrive, and building community resilience, we are shaping the future of digital commerce and ensuring that the benefits of technology and commerce are shared broadly across all communities.

# INNOVATIONS ACROSS THE LAZADA ECOSYSTEM

In an ever-evolving digital landscape, growing consumer demand for engagement, innovation and technology across the region has driven Lazada to apply emerging technologies to unlock innovations. From cutting-edge advancements to seamless customer experiences, we continue to redefine the online retail experience and empower our 160 million monthly active users to participate in the digital economy through our platform. One of Lazada’s key investments for long-term, sustainable growth is our continuous research into how technology can benefit our shoppers and sellers. By adopting emerging technologies, brands stay competitive in Southeast Asia’s markets, while shoppers make confident, informed purchases through innovative solutions.

# Artificial Intelligence (AI) on Lazada

# Unlocking Innovations for Better Choice and Value

In the face of an ongoing inflationary environment, consumers are struggling with the rising cost of living and adopting more cost-conscious habits, leading to more selective consumption. Addressing this new reality, we introduced a new platform channel, “Choice”, in 2023, with the aim to “bring the best value products to Southeast Asian consumers”. Choice guarantees access to quality products at competitive prices, along with shipping and bundle discounts that further reduce the cost of purchase. This is made possible by logistical efficiency as consumers can bundle multiple items into single orders, reducing the number of delivery trips compared to individual orders. Through Choice, we are not only prioritizing buyers’ needs for quality, convenience, and an exceptional customer experience, but also enhancing the efficiency of our logistical processes.

To empower user purchase decisions, Lazada has incorporated AI technology within its platform, launching an “Ask the Buyers” feature to generate product-related questions for users. By analyzing consumer data, and identifying patterns and preferences, the AI algorithms create questions that aid users in product selection. Additionally, the AI technology enhances product reviews for newly launched products and helps generate compelling selling points. By actively involving buyers in the decision-making process through this technology, brands on Lazada’s platform are able to foster a sense of involvement and improve the overall shopping experience.

# AI Chatbot LazzieChat

LazzieChat is the first eCommerce AI chatbot of its kind in Southeast Asia, powered by OpenAI ChatGPT technology in Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service. Designed to enhance the shopping experience, LazzieChat answers users’ queries on Lazada’s platform, providing personalized assistance. Initially launched in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore, LazzieChat enables customers to receive immediate responses, find products that match their preferences or answer, and get detailed answers to specific product questions. This chatbot empowers buyers to make more informed decisions and enhances their confidence in online shopping.

# AI-powered and Augmented Reality (AR) Skin Test Technology

Lazada’s latest innovation, the AI-powered and AR Skin Test Technology, enables users to quickly diagnose and analyze their skin using their phone cameras, in under a minute. Based on the analysis results, buyers receive personalized product recommendations tailored to their specific needs and concerns. This advanced technology helps users better understand their skin conditions and make more informed decisions about skincare products. First launched in Thailand in October 2023, the feature offers nine different AR scenarios, each showcasing a variety of products tailored to different settings.

# AR Feature: Put In My Home

The new AR feature, "Put In My Home," allows buyers to visualize products in their own living spaces, enabling a virtual experience that helps them make more informed purchase decisions. This interactive feature enhances the shopping experience and fosters better engagement with the brands.

# Reducing Barriers and Facilitating Seamless Payments

At Lazada, we support financial inclusion and community empowerment by building an open, accessible digital ecosystem. We offer convenient, secure payment and financing options to support lifestyle needs, aiming to increase accessibility to digital commerce through new alternative payment methods.

# Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)

The rise of digital commerce is built on the success of sellers and local businesses. As we are committed to the continued development of the industry, it is crucial that our sellers and local businesses, who are vital elements of the ecosystem, have what they need to build resilience and grow sustainably. At Lazada, we continually seek to understand mega-trends and change drivers, transforming these insights into actionable strategies for sellers and brands. Through our tools and platform, we empower businesses to thrive in the digital marketplace and meet the diverse demands of Southeast Asia’s markets.

Lazada offers BNPL as an alternative payment method, allowing buyers to defer payments and make purchases through installment plans. This payment option is especially helpful for individuals without traditional banking services or credit cards, as it expands their access to credit. To further enhance the reach and accessibility of BNPL, Lazada has partnered with financial institutions, making it easier for a wider audience to benefit from this flexible payment option.

# Empowering Sustainable Growth: Lazada Sustainability Academy and Sellers Acceleration Camp

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) form the backbone of Southeast Asian economies, making their participation in sustainable practices vital for regional climate progress. As a leading digital commerce platform, Lazada launched the Lazada Sustainability Academy (LSA) in October 2023. This pioneering initiative in Southeast Asia’s digital commerce industry, developed in close collaboration with esteemed industry experts, offers a wealth of resources readily accessible to SME sellers at any stage of their sustainability journey. Through LSA, sellers not only learn the essentials of running a sustainable business but also explore various aspects of sustainability, including sustainable packaging practices, energy-efficient operations, product traceability, the circular economy, and employee health and safety.

More than 1 million SMEs ready to adopt sustainability business practices were invited to the Seller Acceleration Camp, an intensive two-day boot camp followed by a six-month coaching program led by subject matter experts. Participants gained hands-on knowledge of actionable sustainable practices and effective impact measurement. Outstanding participants received recognition awards from Lazada for embracing responsible business practices. The camp was first piloted in Indonesia in October 2023 with 30 selected local sellers, in partnership with Kopernik, the International Trade Centre, and Modalku.

# Adding More to Life

Aligned with Lazada’s brand proposition, “Add to Cart. Add to Life,” Lazada Run is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to empowering customers to enrich their lives by “Adding Fitness to Life.” This inaugural multi-country running tour spanned six Southeast Asian cities: Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, Bangkok, Manila, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. The event culminated in the Ultimate Southeast Asia Challenge held in Singapore, where top participants from the 21km and 10km races competed for cash prizes of US$3,500 and US$2,000, respectively.

The race featured routes infused with interactive activities, prioritizing both runners’ safety and a premium experience. A pioneering addition to the event was the introduction of pacers adorned with vouchers attached to their waistbands, offering participants the unique opportunity to grab them midway through the race. Additionally, distance markers with QR codes were placed along the race routes, allowing participants to collect vouchers by scanning the codes.

Lazada Run aimed to meet the demand for offline fitness and wellness activities while strengthening Lazada’s brand affinity through a meaningful experience. By providing a fun and engaging environment, Lazada is helping customers to stay fit and active, showcasing our commitment to enhancing lives beyond the digital realm.

# Community Health Center near Cimanggis Lazada Warehouse

As an early player in the digital commerce space, we have seen firsthand how it opens up access to rural areas and brings significant benefits to people’s lives. Accessibility to healthcare remains an issue for many communities in the region where we operate, and we saw an opportunity to leverage our logistics infrastructure to help address this issue for the wider community in Indonesia.

During the reporting period, Lazada established a health center facility (Puskesmas) near the Cimanggis Lazada Warehouse to engage the local community. This facility is used by nearby residents for regular community meetings and various local activities, including health activities organized by local health centers and sub-districts.

At the same time, we are vested in the growth of digital talents in the markets where we operate.

Our success relies on bringing out the best in our people, known as Lazadians. We are continuously seeking out the best approaches, policies, and systems to create the right environment that nurtures growth and development, allowing our employees’ best ideas to surface as we advance in our work of setting new standards for digital commerce.

# Shaping the Future of Digital Commerce Through Educators Today

Educators play a crucial role in developing digital talent and preparing Indonesia’s young generation for a productive future. To equip teachers with knowledge relevant to the digital economy, Lazada Indonesia, in collaboration with the West Java Ministry of Education through the Acceleration of Indonesian Digital People’s Work Movement (AKAR), organized the “Naik KeLaz” Training of Trainers (ToT) program. This program informed vocational high school teachers about the economic opportunities and accessibility of the digital commerce industry. With this deeper understanding of the industry, teachers can better nurture skilled talents for the digital economy, introducing students to the potential of a career in digital commerce from a young age.

# Talent Attraction

At Lazada, we are dedicated to creating a positive and inclusive working culture that attracts and retains top talent. We believe everyone has unique contributions to offer, and we aim to cultivate an environment where all employees feel valued and respected.

# Promoting Diversity, Equal Opportunity, and Non-discrimination

Women make up 43% of Lazada’s workforce, compared to a lower female representation in the technology industry, where women only represent 33% of the workforce at large tech companies. Celebrating the diverse backgrounds of our employees, we nurture talent within the regions we operate and embrace the rich diversity of Lazadians from 32 nationalities.

Our talent attraction strategy emphasizes inclusivity and equal opportunities, ensuring job postings, recruitment channels, and communication materials are free from discriminatory language and biases. We uphold a fair and inclusive culture based on meritocracy and mutual respect, condemning all forms of bias, harassment, and discrimination. To support this, we incorporate ongoing educational initiatives within our organization that help enhance awareness and understanding. By maintaining these standards, we ensure a respectful and supportive environment for all Lazadians.

# Talent Development

We continually invest in the development of Lazadians so they can reach their full potential in an evolving business landscape. Beyond conventional training, we offer a range of learning resources, including workshops, e-learning modules, and coaching programs, catering to the varied learning styles of our diverse workforce. Our learning and development framework is adapted from the 70-20-10 model:

|70% ON THE JOB EXPERIENCE|20% COACHING AND FEEDBACK|10% STRUCTURED TRAINING|
|---|---|---|
|On-the-job learning|Performance review and career discussions|Classroom training|
|Stretch assignments|Coaching|Workshops|
|Cross-functional projects|Collaborative learning|Conferences and summits|
|Special projects|Networking through organization-wide events|E-learning modules|

# Inspiring Young Creative Minds

Lazada believes a robust digital economy will create a prosperous and inclusive future for Asia. In October 2023, Lazada Indonesia collaborated with the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investment Affairs of Indonesia and Selaksa to host the Asian Creative & Digital Economy Youth Summit (ACE-YS) with the theme “New Waves from the SEA”. Hundreds of young professionals from ASEAN+3 (ASEAN countries, China, Japan, and South Korea), aged 18-35, gathered to share experiences, solve problems, and accelerate the growth of the creative economy.

# ESG Training for Lazadians

During the reporting period, we launched our first ESG training module titled “ESG Essentials for Lazadians”, to introduce Lazada employees to sustainability. The module provides a foundational understanding of ESG principles, enabling employees to apply these learnings in their day-to-day business practices. In addition to the basic training, specialized content was available for employees in Procurement and Communications functions to ensure practical application relevant to their roles. With this increased awareness, our employees are encouraged to become ambassadors of sustainability by integrating sustainable practices into their daily actions and communications.

FY2024 ESG Impact Report

# Employee Well-being

Our comprehensive employee benefits encompass a variety of offerings to meet the different needs of our employees. To maintain the relevance and competitiveness of our benefits program, we conduct regular reviews based on user feedback and benchmark analyses against market standards. These holistic evaluations enable us to optimize our offerings effectively. Recent enhancements include the introduction of flexi-credits, allowing employees to choose benefits that align with their individual needs.

# Building Mental Health Support in the Workplace

In October 2023, Lazada hosted a region-wide offline and online watch party engaging more than 300 employees from Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and China, for an “Anchoring Yourself Amidst Anxiety” livestream. This event was part of efforts to normalize mental health conversations within workplace communities. During the livestream, employees discussed managing mental well-being by recognizing signs and symptoms of anxiety and learning tips for coping with it. Additionally, information about Lazada’s mental health support resources, including LazListen, was shared. LazListen offers a round-the-clock support hotline and confidential consultations with trained professionals, providing employees the resources they need for mental health support.

# Lazada Running Clubs and Wellness Clubs

Extending our brand belief, “Add to Cart, Add to Life,” to include our employees and foster a culture of an active and healthy lifestyle, we have introduced Lazada Running and Wellness Clubs to engage our employees and encourage them to “Add Fitness to Life”.

# Spinal Evaluation for Logistics Employees

In Singapore, Lazada partnered with PERKs to provide free spinal evaluation for logistics employees. Given the physical demands of their work, these employees are particularly vulnerable to spinal discomfort issues. The assessment included checks for the shoulder, neck, and lower back, along with posture analysis and range of motion testing. On-site experts offered personalized advice to improve posture and manage discomfort.

# Connecting Lazadians through a Culture of Celebration

We connect with Lazadians by recognizing their contributions to our organizational success and celebrating achievements and diversity within the workplace. By fostering a culture of appreciation and inclusion, we are constantly working to ensure every Lazadian feels valued and motivated to contribute to our shared success.

# 510 Lazada Day – Inspired by You, United as One

We celebrated the contributions of Lazadians and their support systems during Lazada Day in 2023. The event, attended by over 5,000 people including employees, their families, and friends, featured fun and engaging activities. Inspiring employee stories were highlighted to showcase the unique personas of Lazadians, both at work and in their personal lives, promoting an inclusive and supportive workplace culture. The event included office tours, eco-friendly reminders, and reusable goodie bags. Additionally, Lazada collaborated with its brand partners to celebrate their role in the extended community.

In Singapore, fitness workout sessions are hosted monthly in addition to weekly running sessions, inviting employees to try out a variety of fitness programs such as HIIT, Circuit Training, Body Attack, Piloxing and Barreless classes.In the Philippines, an active running club meets periodically for a quick run or jog around the office area. Additionally, sports clubs regularly organize activities like basketball and football games, providing employees with an avenue to bond, have fun and train.In China, there are 14 sports and wellness clubs across four different locations offering a range of activities such as badminton, table tennis, frisbee, yoga and band jamming sessions, ensuring everyone can find something they enjoy.In Malaysia, two sports clubs organized bi-weekly badminton and futsal games. Additionally, Pilates and Zumba sessions are conducted in the office, offering employees convenient opportunities to unwind and stay active at their workplace.

# Recognizing Employee Contributions During Mega Campaign Seasons

Mega campaigns are the busy peak periods for employees across the Group, from customer service teams ensuring transactions are completed smoothly to logistics teams ensuring timely deliveries. To support our employees through these demanding times, we create a motivating and uplifting work environment with engagement activities such as roving surprises, photobooths, giveaways, and bonding games through these campaign seasons. These initiatives unite our employees and help create space for fun and team bonding.

# ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

At Lazada, we understand our shared responsibility to protect the environment and promote sustainable practices. As the digital commerce sector continues to grow across the region, the environmental impact is likely to be amplified especially in the form of increased emissions from deliveries, more packaging and plastic waste, and greater landfill contributions. Operationally, the technologies needed to support the digital economy’s growth can increase energy demand and e-waste generation.

We recognize that our operations can have significant environmental impacts if not managed responsibly. It starts with us to mitigate these impacts and promote sustainable practices across the industry. Lazada's dedication to environmental stewardship is demonstrated through our innovative initiatives implemented in collaboration with various partners. These efforts aim to reduce our carbon footprint, minimize waste, and foster eco-friendly practices throughout our ecosystem. By integrating sustainable solutions into our business model, we seek to contribute to a greener future while supporting the well-being of the communities we serve.

FY2024 ESG Impact Report

# CARBON FOOTPRINT

Climate change poses a significant challenge to businesses worldwide, and the digital commerce sector is no exception. As global temperatures rise and weather patterns become increasingly unpredictable, the ripple effects to our operations, environment, and communities are profound.

# Innovative Pathways to a Clean Energy Future

In the face of obstacles like limited infrastructure and steep initial setup costs, our dedication to catalyzing positive change remains unwavering. We look to innovative approaches to propel us forward in our journey of integrating clean energy into our everyday operations.

At Lazada, we acknowledge our responsibility in the collective effort to address climate change. To understand our carbon footprint, we continuously update our carbon accounting methodologies13 to reflect real-world conditions and diligently monitor our progress in managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the reporting period, Lazada successfully established an internal carbon data collection platform, enhancing our data quality and accuracy. Where applicable, we have shifted from estimate-based to activity-based carbon accounting methodology, meaning our calculated Scope 1 emissions are based on actual business activities rather than relying on general estimates. This shift provides a more accurate and precise measurement of our carbon footprint.

# Renewable Energy Adoption in Lazada Indonesia

Lazada Indonesia initiated the use of renewable energy by installing solar panels at its logistics facilities. Solar energy was first introduced at two facilities, located in Bali and Bandung, in June and September 2023 respectively, with expected annual outputs of 9,800 kWh and 3,700 kWh. Building on the success of these pilot projects, Lazada Indonesia expanded the initiative to its largest logistics facility in Cimanggis Depok, West Java. This facility is expected to produce approximately 500,000 kWh of solar energy annually, meeting about 13% of the facility’s electricity needs.

As a result of adopting this new activity-based carbon accounting methodology and implementing other business optimization initiatives to lower overall electricity consumption, our overall GHG emissions are 40% lower than in the previous reporting14 period. Specifically, our reported emissions have decreased by 54% in Scope 1, 8% and 30% in Scope 2 and Scope 3.

# Proportion of GHG Emissions in FY2024 (%)

|Scope 1|5%|
|---|---|
|Scope 2|34%|
|Scope 3|62%|

# Changes in GHG Emissions in FY2024 Compared to FY2023 (%)

|Scope 1|-54%|
|---|---|
|Scope 2|-8%|
|Scope 3|-30%|

# Piloting Thailand’s First Green Logistics Hub

In September 2023, Lazada Thailand launched its first eco-friendly logistics hub at the Tha Raeng – Ram Inthra Logistics Hub to minimize its environmental impact through three key strategies: using solar power, utilizing electric motorcycles for transportation, and providing delivery partners with uniforms made from recycled PET plastics bottles. Following a successful pilot program, the initiative to use recycled plastic uniforms has been expanded to include all new delivery partners working with Lazada Thailand.

# Energy-saving Program in Lazada Thailand Sortation Center

At Lazada Thailand’s Theparak Sortation Center (TPKSC), various energy-saving measures have been implemented to optimize electricity usage and reduce carbon footprint. By identifying high electricity consumption areas, such as the continuously operating “Big Fan,” a scheduling system was introduced to control the fan’s operation, ensuring it runs only when necessary. Additionally, an alternative ventilation system with entrance shutters designed for natural air ventilation was installed, reducing temperatures effectively without the constant use of fans. These initiatives collectively help lower energy consumption and associated carbon emissions.

# Results

27% usage for fans after implementing the reduction in daily electricity scheduling system.

13Please refer to Appendix page 23

14Restating historical emissions data using the activity-based carbon accounting method is not possible because the company does not have the detailed records such as specific activity levels from previous years needed for accurate recalculation.

# MATERIALS AND PACKAGING

With the growth of digital commerce, the demand for products and their corresponding packaging materials is rising in tandem. Sustainable materials offer a solution to minimize environmental impact while meeting demands. Lazada is committed to continuously adopting and developing innovative sustainable materials solutions for our products and packaging.

# Collaboration for Further Innovation

We believe in collective action for sustainable growth. As a leader in our ecosystem, we collaborate with partners to develop innovative and sustainable solutions. Together, we can drive positive impact by promoting environmental responsibility and pave the way for a more sustainable future.

Lazada Logistics, under its Fulfillment by Lazada (FBL) initiative, has integrated sustainability considerations into its packaging practices, ensuring all materials used are responsibly sourced. Since September 2023, all carton boxes used in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam are sourced from suppliers certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Additionally, Lazada Logistics repurposes inbound carton boxes as void fills in packaging, promoting the reuse of materials and reducing the need for plastics fills.

To further reduce carton box usage, RedMart offers customers the option to return carton boxes in good condition to delivery partners during deliveries. During the reporting period, RedMart has reused more than 220,000 carton boxes for delivery. In addition, both Lazada Express and RedMart have implemented guidelines to avoid extra packaging for individual bulky items, further reducing unnecessary carton box usage.

# Collaborating to Encourage Proper E-Waste Disposal

In February 2024, Lazada Thailand partnered with AIS, a major local mobile phone operator and network provider, to launch the “Give the E-Waste, Get the Code” campaign. The campaign aimed to educate and encourage customers to dispose of e-waste properly by introducing convenient e-waste collection boxes at selected AIS branches. These collection points not only made the disposal process easier but also allowed users to track the journey of the e-waste deposited using AIS’ E-Waste+ app, an innovative blockchain-based platform. As an added incentive, users who participated in the campaign received online shopping vouchers usable on Lazada’s platform, enhancing the campaign’s appeal and encouraging more users to participate in sustainable practices.

# Offering Sustainable Product Options

In line with our sustainability goals, we collaborate closely with suppliers to ensure RedMart house brand products meet high environmental and social responsibility standards throughout their lifecycle, from production to procurement. One key approach involves evaluating and ensuring that the RedMart house brand food range prioritizes healthy products without added MSG. Recognizing that material selection and product packaging significantly influence our environmental footprint, we aim to introduce sustainable products that empower buyers to shop sustainably.

# Currently, RedMart’s sustainable product range features:

- ECO Products: We develop innovative items within RedMart’s ECO Products range, including products such as garbage bags, dishwashing liquids, bamboo wipes, and corn starch foodware.
- ECO Packaging: We provide responsible packaging solutions that reduce and remove excess packaging, use compostable and recycled materials, avoid harmful substances, and provide disposal information where possible.
- Locally Manufactured: We support local producers and growers by featuring local products and promoting them to shoppers on our platform.
- Organic: Our house brand food products labeled organic meet established certified organic standards such as United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Organic and European Union (EU) Organic standards.
- Responsible Sourcing: We ensure the responsible sourcing of products, including FSC-certified paper, cage-free poultry and eggs, as well as free-range meat that meets RSPCA standards.

# Collaborating to Reduce Ocean Waste

Building upon efforts from the last reporting period, Lazada Indonesia continues to tackle ocean waste and foster sustainable development in one of the world’s largest archipelagos. The coastal and marine areas of the Thousand Islands in Indonesia face a significant waste problem due to the rising volume of single-use plastics and high logistics costs for waste disposal. The year-long Islands Cleanup program included an Islands Hackathon, environmental actions, on-the-ground initiatives, and community engagements.

In collaboration with the Archipelagic and Island States (AIS) Forum and the Coordinating Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Investment (Kemenkomarves) in Indonesia, Lazada held an Islands Hackathon competition aimed at identifying innovative solutions for the waste problem in the Thousand Islands. The winning solution involves using pyrolysis technology to convert plastic waste into fuel for inter-island transportation. Subsequently, the winning team secured seed funding and showcased their solution at the AIS High-level Meeting in October 2023, which was attended by 47 heads of state and country representatives.

More than 3,500 pieces of e-waste collected.

46% of the products in our RedMart house brand sustainable product range are locally manufactured.

# EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE

At Lazada, we proactively embrace governance, understanding its crucial role in achieving sustainable success. Our governance framework emphasizes responsible business practices, data privacy, and the protection of intellectual property (IP) rights.

We understand the importance of building a secure and trustworthy marketplace for both brands and consumers. This commitment begins with robust security practices. Our ISO 27001:2013 certified management system ensures the highest level of security for our corporate information assets. Additionally, Lazada Singapore achieved the Advocate-level certification under the Cyber Trust mark program, conferred by the certification body appointed by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore.

# Effective Governance

# Appendix

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Our governance structure is anchored in strong ethical behavior and corporate responsibility, ensuring long-term sustainability and success. This is supported by a robust risk management framework that effectively identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks, protecting our assets and reputation.

# Upholding Business Ethics and Anti-corruption

As an ethical and responsible entity, we are committed to conducting business with unwavering ethical principles, adhering to national laws and international trade rules. Our governance policies encompass critical areas such as:

|Code of Business Conduct|The Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy|Conflict of Interest Provision|Supplier Code of Conduct|Grievance Mechanisms|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Expected behavior for all Lazada employees across basic duties, compliance, anti-discrimination and anti-money laundering|We adopt a zero-tolerance approach aligned with global laws|Measures for addressing actual, perceived, or potential conflicts|Expected behavior and compliance requirements for our suppliers with any violation possibly leading to the termination of contracts|Confidential reporting mechanisms|

We take pride in our strong practices established throughout the organization, which have helped us maintain a record of zero instances of corruption and bribery. To support this, we provide a whistleblowing mailbox (whistleblow@lazada.com) for reporting any suspected or actual fraud, corruption, illegal acts, or unethical practices. Additionally, we offer annual training and e-learning refresher courses focused on our Code of Business Conduct and ABC policy, emphasizing compliance and corruption prevention. New employees are required to complete an e-learning module to familiarize themselves with Lazada’s policies, ensuring everyone is well-informed from the start.

# Protecting Customer Privacy

Customer privacy is a top priority, closely tied to our cybersecurity efforts. We assess third-party service providers’ security measures through our Third-party Risk Management program to meet regulatory and contractual data privacy obligations. This program involves risk profiling, collaborative risk assessments, and due diligence during onboarding. As a result, we achieved no substantiated complaints concerning customer privacy breaches or data losses in the reporting period, down from one incident in the previous reporting period. We remain committed to promptly addressing all security and privacy-related queries and requests from stakeholders. These matters are promptly reviewed and resolved swiftly at various operational levels, following our established privacy incident handling processes and protocols.

# CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY

In digital commerce, cybersecurity and data privacy are crucial for success, given the vast amount of data flowing through our online platform. Strong internal management systems and regular external audits further enhance our cybersecurity measures.

# Ensuring Cybersecurity

To safeguard our digital assets, we conducted penetration testing with internal and external teams and addressed identified issues through our internal vulnerability management platform. Our vulnerability management process includes routine network scans and automatic scans before application deployment. We also promote user and employee awareness through our security initiatives, which include regular drills, training, and awareness campaigns.

# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Intellectual property protection is vital for a legally compliant and healthy digital commerce environment in Southeast Asia. To ensure compliance, all new sellers must complete web-based Lazada University course modules, covering Lazada's platform terms and conditions as well as IP Rights (IPR) protection policies. Sellers are informed about the consequences of non-compliance, which include penalties on product listings or account termination. Lazada’s robust IPR protection program comprises many technology-leveraged modules to ensure a robust defense against IP infringement on our platform:

|IPP Platform|IPP Plus Program|Proactive Measures|Online-To-Offline Enforcement|
|---|---|---|---|
|Rights holders can register accounts, submit and track takedown requests, including counter-notices by sellers, on the IPP Platform.|Selected rights holders on the IPP Plus Program, including over 100 brands, benefit from expedited takedown processing and enhanced support.|Advanced technology like AI and image recognition is used to proactively remove counterfeit listings.|Lazada supports rights holders in offline investigations and enforcement actions targeting the entire supply chain to prevent counterfeit goods from entering the online sales channel.|

Over 230 leads have been analyzed with brand partners. The platform processes over 97% of requests within 72 hours, with a median time of under 15 hours. Listings are processed within 48 hours, with a median time of under 8 hours. Over 96% of takedown requests filed by IPP Plus users occurred. This program includes over 140 brands and achieves a 90% removal rate before transactions.

# Asian Legal Business (ALB) Southeast Asia Awards

Lazada was recognized at the prestigious ALB Southeast Asia Awards during the reporting period. We were honored with the title “Compliance and Risk Management In-House Team of the Year” for the third consecutive year, acknowledging our exceptional compliance and risk management capabilities. This recognition reflects our innovation in various tools, including those for managing privacy incidents, an ABC due diligence review tool for our Corporate Social Responsibility activities, and a law enforcement request portal that allows us to efficiently manage regulatory requests. By leveraging technology and automation, we continuously improve to build a reliable platform for our buyers and brands, aiming for sustainable, long-term growth with all our ecosystem partners.

15 “Substantiated complaints” are those made by third-parties or regulatory bodies. For a complaint to be considered substantiated, Lazada is required to report the issue to a relevant regulator, or the regulator must start an investigation based on a complaint from an affected party. Additionally, complaints must result in penalties for Lazada such as fines, jail terms, orders to stop certain activities, or a business halt, or lead to voluntary corrective actions by Lazada.

16 The number of complaints concerning customer privacy breaches or customer data losses for FY2023 has been restated to one (1). In FY2023, RedMart Limited recorded an inquiry from the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) of Singapore regarding an incident report on the legitimate interest for the collection of personal information and measures to eliminate and mitigate risks of unauthorized use and disclosure of such information. In the final decision issued by the PDPC on 18 January 2023, the Commissioner confirmed that RedMart has met the requirements for reliance on the Legitimate Interest Exception, including the enhanced access controls implemented to mitigate risks of unauthorized use and disclosure of personal information collected. No evidence of incidents resulted in customer privacy breaches or data losses. Details of the PDPC statement can be viewed at: DECISION OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION.

17 Criteria for selecting rights holders for the IPP Plus Program include reporting volume and accuracy of past takedown requests.

18 The decrease is due to more actions taken compared to the previous year.

# Description On Methodology

# GHG Emissions

GHG emissions refer to a group of gases that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation. Lazada adopted the operational control method in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard for its direct (Scope 1) and indirect electricity (Scope 2) GHG emissions. Computation of Scope 3 emissions is based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.

# Scope 1

Direct GHG emissions occurring from sources owned or controlled by Lazada’s operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam in the reporting period. Lazada’s Scope 1 emissions sources include:
