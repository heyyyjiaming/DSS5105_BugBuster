# Letter From Kara Hurst

Reflecting on the last year, I’m proud of the work our teams around the world have accomplished and I’m excited about what’s ahead. We have taken important steps forward in our social, community, and environmental work, while always expanding our vision for the future. At the center of it all is our customer obsession. Sustainability is an important issue for our customers around the world, and we are continually investing, inventing, and improving to make every customer interaction more sustainable than the last.

This isn’t a distant vision for the future—this work is well underway now. Take our e-commerce business. From the moment a customer clicks “Buy Now” to when their package arrives on their doorstep, we have teams of scientists and engineers working to make that process more sustainable, all without compromising on speed, safety, or convenience. We are deploying new building technologies, such as low-carbon concrete, to make our facilities more sustainable—as seen in the launch of our second headquarters buildings, which set a new standard for sustainable design. We are investing in renewable energy around the world, and we are the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world for the third year in a row. Our teams are analyzing routes and distances to build a logistics system that gets packages to customers faster, with fewer emissions. And we are transitioning our fleet to roll out 100,000 Rivian electric delivery vehicles by 2030, with thousands on the road now.

And that’s just a small part of our story. While our most visible sustainability work may be in how we deliver orders to customers’ doorsteps, we are more than an e-commerce company. Amazon is an entertainment studio, cloud provider, grocer, and more—and we are making sustainability a priority across all of our businesses.

No matter the industry, from entertainment to grocery to cloud computing, we are determined to show the world that if we can do this, others can too. In many cases, our work sends important demand signals to the market, which helps drive more renewable energy, more-sustainable building materials, and other innovations that help businesses and organizations around the world reduce their own impact on the environment.

Scaling our positive impact is underpinned by The Climate Pledge—a commitment to be net-zero carbon by 2040—which we co-founded in 2019. The Pledge invites every sector that touches our business (and those that don’t) to make their own ambitious climate commitments. We are creating a community that inspires each other to do more, and to out-innovate even ourselves as we know we can’t do this alone. More than 390 companies across 36 countries signed the Pledge by the end of 2022, and we are determined to keep bringing on new partners to help combat climate change.

When we look back at this moment in time, my hope is this: that our teams are immensely proud of the ambitious challenge we took on and the solutions we implemented, and that we have continued to build on our progress to keep thinking even bigger and moving even faster. That our customers see that we remained obsessed with tackling some of the world’s biggest sustainability challenges on their behalf. And that we were willing to make the big bets necessary—even if we wouldn’t see results for years to come—to ensure the next great climate solutions can scale fast to help set our planet back on the right track, and that all future generations can live in healthy, thriving communities.

With gratitude,

Kara Hurst

Vice President, Worldwide Sustainability, Amazon

# Our Approach

At Amazon, we take on grand challenges, make big bets, and invent on behalf of customers. That’s exactly how we approach our carbon-emissions reduction: by making a big bet to reach net-zero carbon 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement, then inventing new approaches across our business that will help us get there—all while maintaining the speed, convenience, and reliability that customers expect from Amazon.

These are incredibly hard challenges. Many of the solutions required to achieve global decarbonization don’t exist yet. And the challenges are also made more complex by the fact that—thanks to strong customer demand—we are a business that continues to grow. Meeting the needs of our customers while simultaneously reducing our impact will take time, along with invention and collaboration from all areas of our company. Teams across every part of Amazon have a decarbonization strategy as part of their long-term organizational plan. We hold ourselves accountable through goal setting and regular reporting. We are investing in breakthrough technology, including promising early-stage decarbonization technology that we back through our $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund.

We cannot do this alone. We need governments around the world to work together with us as we engage in climate policy to drive decarbonization at scale. We also need the support of our suppliers and other businesses, which is why we are building a cross-sector community of companies, organizations, individuals, and partners through The Climate Pledge. In 2022, we were joined by 111 new signatories, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Maersk, SAP, and PwC. They join a community of signatories totaling more than 390 at the end of 2022, all committed to reaching net-zero carbon by 2040, which will have a significant positive impact on the planet. We take inspiration from the progress these companies have made and hope to inspire others with Amazon’s efforts to accelerate decarbonization with a global, collective approach.

As we work together on decarbonizing entire industries, it’s difficult to reduce or eliminate emissions in certain areas, because sufficient low-carbon technologies do not exist at scale. But we are not waiting. We are working with industry groups to find solutions for those hard-to-abate emissions, such as from airfreight and cargo shipping, and we are excited about what’s ahead.

Our Progress

Amazon’s Carbon Footprint

In 2022, our absolute carbon emissions decreased by 0.4%, even as our year-over-year net sales grew 9%. We achieved this in large part by improving efficiency across our business and continuing our investment in renewable energy. In fact, in 2022, we announced that we grew our renewable energy capacity by 8 gigawatts, which was a record for the most announced by a company in a single year and made us the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the third year in a row.

Our carbon intensity decreased by 7% from 2021 to 2022, and by 24% since 2019. Over the last four years, our business has consistently become less carbon intensive, which further shows we are decoupling emissions growth from our growth as a business. Carbon intensity measures grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per dollar of gross merchandise sales (GMS).

including Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels (coZEV), which we helped launch, and the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), which is focused on increasing investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Key to making renewable energy more impactful is to find ways of storing it for when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining. We continue to invest in renewable energy projects that are paired with energy storage. Additionally, in 2022, The Climate Pledge Fund invested in Electric Hydrogen and Sunfire, two promising U.S.- and Europe-based developers of electrolyzers, which convert water into green hydrogen—an energy source that can be stored for future use. It’s another example of the investment in innovation that Amazon is known for.

To reduce indirect emissions, it’s important to be able to measure them accurately. We support and fund industry partnerships to gather more accurate data, including the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3), which helps measure embodied carbon in buildings, and the Smart Freight Centre’s Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework, a globally recognized methodology for measuring freight transportation emissions.

Like other large corporates and many signatories to the Pledge, we do not have all the answers today, not least because in many cases the answers do not yet exist or they do exist but are not yet available at scale. We are, however, steadfast in pursuing solutions and working collectively to find the answers and create the demand signals to bring new technologies to scale. We remain focused on reaching net-zero carbon by 2040, a focus we have maintained since we first announced The Climate Pledge in 2019. Through innovation, collaboration, determination, and a promise to deliver the best for our customers, we will achieve our goal, and most importantly, contribute to a future on a healthier planet.

# Reducing Our Scope 3 Emissions

Activities that take place beyond our direct operations are reflected in our Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, Scope 3 emissions went down by 0.7%, despite our year-over-year growth. We saw a decrease in Scope 3 emissions from building construction, leased buildings and equipment, and third-party transportation (as more goods were shipped by Amazon’s own logistics providers versus third-party providers).

# Investing in Renewables

We are proud that our investments in renewable energy, used to power our operations, have resulted in a 29% drop in carbon emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2). This now accounts for less than 5% of our total reported carbon footprint. In 2022, 90% of electricity consumed by Amazon was attributable to renewable energy sources, and we remain on a path to reach 100% by 2025.

Electricity powers our data centers, fulfillment centers, physical stores, and corporate offices, as well as the EVs that charge at our delivery stations. As a first step, we focus on energy efficiency throughout our operations. We then purchase electricity from renewable energy projects, through on-site solar installations and utility-scale, off-site solar and wind projects. We grew our total number of renewable projects to 401 in 22 countries, with a capacity of more than 20 GW. That’s enough capacity to power the equivalent of 5.3 million U.S. homes every year.

Given our success as the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, we will seek to help select suppliers transition to carbon-free electricity. Our potential for impact across our supply chain is big because it spans building.

# The Climate Pledge

The Climate Pledge is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge with Global Optimism in 2019 and became the first company to sign on.

# The Climate Pledge Fund

The Climate Pledge Fund is a $2 billion venture investment program supporting the advancement of sustainable technologies and services that will enable Amazon to meet our net-zero carbon goal. Throughout 2022, The Climate Pledge Fund continued its mission to support companies working on promising decarbonization solutions.

The Climate Pledge brings together the world’s top companies to accelerate joint action, cross-sector collaboration, and responsible change. Signatories agree to three areas of action:

- Regular reporting: Measure and report on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a regular basis.
- Carbon elimination: Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through business change and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon-emission-elimination strategies.
- Credible offsets: Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.

# Progress in 2022

As of 2022 year end, The Climate Pledge signatories represent:

|396|Signatories|
|---|---|
|36|Countries|
|55|Industries|

We have set a goal to recruit additional signatories every year. In 2022 alone, 111 companies signed The Climate Pledge. We also facilitated signatory collaboration to tackle hard-to-abate emissions while providing The Climate Pledge community with helpful information and partnerships to drive forward multisectoral decarbonization initiatives.

Through The Climate Pledge Fund, we invest in companies—like electric aircraft innovator BETA Technologies—that are developing low-carbon solutions.

# Equitably Scaling Climate Tech Solutions

Women-founded companies typically receive a fraction of the total venture capital flowing into climate tech startups. In 2022, Amazon became a founding member of the Climate Resolute Coalition, a multistakeholder organization focused on advancing women’s economic empowerment and climate solutions in global supply chains. We also work with various other organizations to enhance equitable opportunities for climate tech entrepreneurs, including Greentown Labs and Elemental Excelerator.

In November 2022, Amazon made a $53 million commitment to help address this gender inequity. This includes a $50 million commitment through The Climate Pledge Fund’s new Female Founder Initiative to invest in women-founded and women-led climate tech companies. Amazon also committed $3 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Climate Gender Equity Fund. As a co-founder of The Climate Pledge, Amazon will work with Pledge signatories and other companies to encourage their additional support and corporate investment in the Climate Gender Equity Fund.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Driving Climate Solutions | Carbon

As well as transporting products in a safe, timely, and efficient manner, we are decarbonizing transportation across our business by:

- Increasing fleet efficiency across inbound transportation, middle mile, and last mile
- Scaling use of EVs and alternative-fuel vehicles
- Increasing use of low-carbon fuels
- Partnering on initiatives to decarbonize the wider transportation industry

Fulfilling items inventoried as close to our customers as possible reduces the distances packages travel to reach customers, particularly in middle mile transportation, where long-haul trucking is a large emissions source. Shorter routes also make our network more conducive to introducing EVs and other lower-impact transportation modes in the long term. We also look to increase the number of items per order, where relevant, encouraging customers to consolidate items into fewer orders by choosing an “Amazon Day” for delivery to minimize the emissions associated with fulfilling their order.

In addition to closing the distance between fulfillment and customer, we are working to reduce emissions per shipped unit by increasing the number of customer orders distributed per trip. For example, we use machine learning algorithms for each order to determine the best packaging solution to eliminate empty space in packages. Computer vision and natural language processing guide our system to pinpoint the optimal packaging type for each item—from bag to box—depending on the level of protection needed. Where possible, we use lightweight packaging by prioritizing flexible paper bags and short envelopes, which are up to 90% lighter than similar-sized, rigid corrugate boxes.

# Amazon’s Delivery and Logistics Network

We rely on a complex transportation network to get products from manufacturers and sellers to customers around the globe. Our logistics network spans every step of the journey—from global transportation to delivery between delivery station and customer. To deliver packages as quickly and efficiently as possible, our logistics network uses different modes of transportation, including ships, planes, freight trains, trucks, vans, and bikes.

# Driving Climate Solutions | Carbon

# Inbound Transportation

In 2022, we piloted a number of electric delivery trucks across North America and Europe, with plans for more in 2023, and we are developing charging infrastructure. We also partner with manufacturers to test and validate new EV models before scaling the technology. Notably, we have introduced 20 fully electric heavy goods vehicles (eHGVs) in Germany, which will replace diesel-fueled road miles. Five similar vehicles have been added to our UK fleet.

Amazon is increasing the use of ocean freight for transoceanic transportation, and reducing airfreight when possible. As an added benefit, ocean transportation has a lower carbon intensity than air transportation, and we continue to reduce the emissions related to ocean freight through the use of biofuels.

# Last Mile

Last mile transportation refers to the final part of the journey, when products are transported from a post office or delivery station to the customer. Traditionally, these trips have been made by gas-powered internal combustion engine vehicles. While these are still common across the industry, we are mitigating emissions with micromobility solutions. In Europe, we have launched micromobility hubs in more than 20 cities to enable shorter deliveries on foot or by e-bike. In the UK specifically, we launched e-bikes in Manchester and London. Similar hubs have been installed across France and Italy, with further micromobility solutions planned.

In the U.S., we continue to improve grocery micromobility delivery operations in New York. Our efforts to deliver grocery orders on foot or via e-bike began in 2019 and have since expanded to cover over 1.6 million orders (over 9.1 million packages) in 2022. This was enabled, in part, by stocking inventory closer to customers. During 2022, we also introduced new, higher-payload e-bike trailers designed to carry heavier packages. These reduce operational costs by converting sites where deliveries are made on foot to use e-bikes and allowing more deliveries to be completed per bike route. We plan to deploy next-generation micromobility equipment in 2023.

# Low-Carbon Fuel Technologies

We are investing in interim ways to reduce the environmental impact of our middle mile truck fleet, including existing lower-emission options powered by RNG. We are also investing in future solutions, like green steel for manufacturing vehicles, as well as renewably generated green hydrogen.

# Middle Mile

Middle mile transportation generally starts when packages arrive at an Amazon facility, such as a cross dock, and includes the journey between fulfillment centers, sort centers, and delivery stations. While some trips may be completed by air or train freight, middle mile transportation is usually completed by truck.

Trucking is a challenging area to decarbonize, particularly considering long-haul distances and the requirements for high-power EV charging infrastructure across transportation routes. There is currently no single solution that can be scaled for decarbonizing middle mile trucking. To help address this challenge, we are experimenting with lower-carbon options, such as trucks powered by renewable natural gas (RNG), battery-electric trucks, and hydrogen-powered trucks.

In August, we also announced a procurement agreement with Plug Power. This partnership will supply Amazon with 10,950 tons of green hydrogen per year—enough to power 40,000 forklifts annually—for transportation and building operations, starting in 2025.

# Did You Know?

Amazon offers Prime members fast delivery options, including Same-Day and One-Day Delivery. We also offer the Amazon Day delivery option, which gives Prime members the ability to choose a designated day of the week to receive their orders. In 2022, Amazon Day saved 115 million boxes.

# Partnering for Decarbonized Transportation

We also gathered crucial data to inform building-specific carbon-reduction roadmaps and 2023 energy-reduction projects. Using this data, we plan to build a tool to enhance our understanding of current energy and carbon efficiencies and to establish energy performance targets.

# Ocean

To reduce our ocean-freight-related transportation emissions, ships used to transport goods must transition to using zero-emission fuels. In early 2023, we co-founded the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance (ZEMBA) together with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, and Tchibo. In March 2023, Inter IKEA Group also joined the alliance. Through ZEMBA, freight buyers will accelerate commercial deployment of zero-emission shipping, enable economies of scale, and minimize maritime emissions, helping to get zero-emission ships on the water by the mid-2020s.

# Land

Decarbonizing our transportation business will require cross-company partnerships, which is why we seek to participate in multistakeholder initiatives to shift the industry toward lower-carbon solutions. For our transportation decarbonization partnerships, we leverage two engagement platforms: the Sustainable Freight Buyers Alliance (SFBA) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) International Transport Forum.

In 2022, we continued to support the Smart Freight Centre, with a focus on identifying and building partnerships that can accelerate transportation decarbonization. Amazon is also playing an active role in several industry initiatives and government partnerships, including the coZEV network, the First Movers Coalition, and the Clean Energy Demand Initiative.

# Air

Airfreight is one of the modes of transportation we use, and SAF is one solution for reducing associated lifecycle emissions. However, SAF represents less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel, because it is still cost prohibitive for most companies. During the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27), SABA announced a digital SAF certificate registry that aims to increase transparency for emissions-reduction claims and accelerate SAF deployment. As a founding member of SABA, Amazon played a key role in developing the registry, which will launch later this year.

# Building Construction and Operations

We aspire to have the most sustainable real estate portfolio in the world. Today, our portfolio comprises thousands of facilities in 66 countries, including operations buildings (fulfillment centers, delivery stations, warehouses, and sort centers), corporate offices, data centers, and physical retail stores. We aim to reduce emissions across our portfolio through increased energy efficiency, expanding our use of renewable energy, and reducing embodied carbon in construction by using lower-emissions materials.

# Physical Stores

In addition to designing new sites with sustainability in mind, we upgraded existing stores with technologies that deliver greater efficiency and carbon emissions savings. Physical stores include those for Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Go.

# International Living Future Institute Certification

Several of our Amazon Go stores are seeking Zero Carbon Certification (ZCC) with the International Living Future Institute (ILFI). The certification requires locations to lower energy use, eliminate on-site gas combustion, and build using lower-carbon materials. In addition to demonstrating our commitment to The Climate Pledge, these certified sites serve as test beds for technologies that we can scale across our business.

# Corporate Offices

Throughout 2022, our Global Real Estate and Facilities team made progress in establishing foundational practices for building and maintaining sustainable buildings. Guidelines were developed and shared with internal teams for integrating more-sustainable practices across leasing, design, construction, and operations.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Driving Climate Solutions | Carbon

Our efforts to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions begin with increasing data collection across all business areas. Throughout 2022, Amazon Transportation Services, Amazon Logistics, Amazon Fresh fulfillment and distribution centers, and Customer Fulfillment in both North America and Europe enhanced data collection to help identify opportunities for greater efficiency in new and existing buildings. In addition to efficiency improvements, we reduce building-related emissions through our corporate renewable power program. As of the end of 2022, 237 Amazon facilities have on-site solar.

# Reducing Natural Gas Use

We are introducing technologies to electrify systems that traditionally run on natural gas, including kitchen equipment, water heaters, and HVAC systems. Amazon Fresh stores in the UK have moved to fully electric systems, while in the U.S., we are piloting fully electric kitchens in several locations. Amazon Go has expanded electric HVAC equipment in Washington state and California.

# Increased Energy Efficiency

By May 2022, Whole Foods Market improved energy efficiency performance by 21% from a 2010 baseline, achieving the U.S. Department of Energy Better Buildings Challenge goal two years ahead of schedule. These improvements were driven, in part, by investing in alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potential (GWP); installing energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; implementing retrofit projects; and launching an energy-awareness program for store operations.

# Natural Refrigeration

Several retail locations are piloting natural refrigerants with near-zero GWP, as well as low-GWP refrigeration technologies. As of the end of 2022, 45 Whole Foods Market stores had installed low-GWP refrigeration systems. An additional 65 stores have been retrofitted to use next-generation Solstice N40 refrigerant, which has a GWP approximately 68% lower than legacy hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. All UK Amazon Fresh stores operate with either natural or low-GWP systems.

# Fulfillment, Logistics, and Distribution Centers

Alongside physical stores, a number of fulfillment, logistics, and distribution sites are pursuing ZCC status through ILFI and ensuring they have access to tools and guidance that help them reduce carbon emissions. We are also focused on increasing energy efficiency in existing sites through lighting retrofits, EBMS retrofits, and rooftop HVAC unit replacements. Through lighting retrofits, we have saved 1 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy and avoided 709,000 metric tons of CO2e over the last seven years. The upgrades included converting all non-LED lamps to high-efficiency LED fixtures with dimming controls.

# Addressing Hard-to-Abate Carbon Emissions

We look to address our largest remaining source of buildings emissions—embodied carbon, primarily in the concrete and steel used in construction. We use the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3) tool to track embodied carbon in our building projects. In 2022, we tracked embodied carbon from more than 400 building projects through EC3. Throughout 2022, we partnered with various organizations to improve embodied carbon reporting. Together with Introba, we developed a methodology for understanding and quantifying embodied carbon in technologies for the logistics sector.

We launched a program to find and validate transformational technologies as lower-cost alternatives to carbon credits in the most difficult-to-abate areas of our building portfolio. We have also introduced a Technical Review Committee to assess and recommend promising technologies to improve resource planning.

# Driving Climate Solutions | Carbon

One of the most visible ways we are innovating for power efficiency is our investment in purpose-built AWS machine learning chips. Our third-generation Arm-based chip, AWS Graviton3, is more energy-efficient, as Graviton3-based Elastic Compute Cloud instances use up to 60% less energy for the same performance than comparable Amazon EC2 instances. Inferentia is our most power-efficient machine learning inference chip. Our Inferentia machine learning chip is up to 54% more energy-efficient and can reduce costs by up to 90% against comparable instances.

# Making History with the World’s First ILFI Zero Carbon Certified Fulfillment Center

One of Amazon’s newest Same-Day fulfillment centers in Sacramento, California, is set to make history as the first fulfillment facility globally to achieve ZCC status. The Same-Day site was built using more sustainable building materials like lower-carbon concrete, a fully electrified HVAC system, and high-efficiency material-handling equipment. The building is solar-ready and designed to have a rooftop solar array that can potentially generate as much as 80% of the facility’s annual electricity needs, with the remaining balance to be supported by Amazon’s off-site renewable energy projects.

# Energy Efficiency

Research shows that in North America, AWS can lower customers’ workload carbon footprints by nearly 80% compared to on-premises computing workloads, and up to 96% once AWS is powered with 100% renewable energy—a target we are on a path to meet by 2025.

When servers are in use, they produce heat. If they produce too much heat, it can impact their performance and lifespan. Air conditioning systems can be energy-inefficient, which is why we look to maximize use of natural air flow to lower server temperatures and energy use requirements. When we design AWS data centers, particularly our data halls, we use models that examine how air moves through spaces. We then create a digital representation of this movement to determine physical properties such as temperature, pressure, and velocity at any location throughout the data hall. This allows us to fully understand how data centers will perform before they’re even built, enabling optimization for higher system reliability and energy efficiency.

Learn more about how we optimize data center cooling systems.

# Embodied Carbon

AWS strives to reduce embodied carbon associated with concrete and steel, the two most carbon-intensive materials used to build our data centers. This includes carbon emitted during extraction, manufacturing, and transportation of materials to data center construction sites.

# Carbon Neutralization

We are reducing emissions related to server use and networking equipment by increasing server lifespan. This includes refining software to run more efficiently, subsequently lowering stress on hardware and extending its useful life. In 2022, we extended AWS server life from four years to five and networking equipment life from five years to six. To support these efforts, AWS has a robust maintenance and repair program designed to increase component reuse and further reduce carbon emissions and waste across our supply chain.

We are working with various suppliers on lower-carbon concrete options. For example, in Northern Virginia, AWS worked with building material provider Holcim to procure ECOPact concrete for several data centers. The concrete mix reduces carbon emissions by nearly 40% compared to standard concrete. AWS worked with American Rock Products (ARP), a CRH Company, to develop a more sustainable concrete mix for data centers across northeastern Oregon. ARP completed Environmental Product Declarations, which summarize environmental impacts across the concrete’s lifecycle, for all products at their plants. Globally in 2022, we completed the construction of 16 data centers using lower-carbon concrete and 10 data centers using lower-carbon steel. We expect these numbers to grow considerably in 2023.

To help prevent our equipment from ending up in landfills and avoid associated emissions, we are investing in responsible end-of-life management systems. AWS uses reverse logistics hubs to evaluate and reuse electronic equipment in our global data center fleet. These hubs help us consolidate, assess, and recirculate functional equipment back into our inventory. When we no longer have use for equipment, we remove all customer data and sell the equipment on the secondary market for reuse or work with a network of experienced vendors to recycle parts.

# Restoring Degraded Landscapes

Restoring landscapes has the potential to remove billions of tons of carbon emissions while improving local livelihoods. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has made clear that significant carbon emissions from several sectors of the economy will not be fully abated by 2050. Even with aggressive decarbonization efforts, many companies will need to neutralize some GHG emissions that cannot be eliminated to achieve net-zero carbon.

Amazon is focused specifically on advancing restoration efforts by the world’s smallholder farmers through programs like the Agroforestry and Restoration Accelerator in Brazil. In 2022, we also advanced development of technological tools, scientific knowledge, and business models to support reforestation and sustainable agroforestry at scale.

# Funding Science and Education for Blue Carbon

With support from Amazon, Conservation International launched the International Blue Carbon Institute at COP27. Based in Singapore, the institute’s mission is to scale action for the protection and restoration of blue carbon ecosystems through innovative research, capacity building, and collaboration. Blue carbon ecosystems are coastal and marine ecosystems that sequester large quantities of carbon in plants and sediments, and can have a pivotal role in climate mitigation.

# Protecting the World’s Tropical Rainforests

Tropical deforestation contributes approximately one-fifth of global emissions. Ending deforestation will require more effective government policy, local stakeholder collaboration, and new pathways for sustainable economic development in tropical forest regions. In 2021, Amazon helped create the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, which has mobilized over $1 billion in corporate and government finance to protect tropical rainforests around the world. In 2022, during COP27, four Brazilian states signed Letters of Intent to participate in the Coalition, bringing participating tropical forest jurisdictions to nine.

To extend the useful life of data center hardware, AWS sends all functional, sanitized, retired server racks and components to its reverse logistics hubs.

# Decarbonizing Through Policy

Achieving global decarbonization will require robust policies and interventions to reduce the cost gap between established and emerging low-carbon technologies. We engage with policymakers and other decision-makers to advance and to provide incentives for decarbonization. This includes policies that advance zero-emission fuels, scale clean energy, modernize the grid, and invest in new technologies needed across multiple industries. We have also supported climate disclosure frameworks to assure data is useful for our customers.

In 2022, we received commitments from 28 suppliers to work with us on decarbonization. We also helped six suppliers of Amazon devices develop renewable energy implementation plans. We are continuing to expand this program in 2023. Next year, we will continue to work directly with our suppliers, and we will update our Supply Chain Standards to require regular reporting and emissions goal setting. We will also use our scale, investment, and innovation to date to provide our suppliers with products and tools that will help them reach their goals—whether that’s transitioning to renewable energy or having more access to sustainable materials.

Learn more about how we are reducing the carbon impact of our devices.

# Looking Forward

In 2022, we joined the Low Carbon Fuels Coalition to drive adoption of more low-carbon fuel standards. Reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 won’t be easy, and we know we can only get there with significant collaboration. We will look to decarbonize across our business, improving data quality and collection to better understand our existing carbon footprint and where we can improve. Additionally, we will continue to engage external partners—whether expert coalitions or our diverse network of suppliers—on efforts to drive down emissions beyond our immediate sphere of influence.

# Engaging Suppliers that Make Amazon Products

To meet our net-zero carbon goal, we engage suppliers in our global product and device supply chains to set goals that support decarbonizing their own operations and work with them on initiatives to reduce their GHG emissions.

We work to create devices our customers love, while also reducing the impact of producing and using those devices.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Driving Climate Solutions | Renewable Energy

By scaling renewable energy, we aim to make Amazon a more resilient, sustainable business and drive a global transition to cleaner energy. We contract renewable power from utility-scale wind and solar projects that add clean energy to the grid. Many of these projects are enabled by long-term contracts such as power purchase agreements (PPAs) for large projects in the same energy grids as our electricity use. Energy load forecasts help guide procurement decisions.

# Our Approach

To achieve our renewable energy goal, we aim for 100% of the electricity we use to be attributable to renewable electricity sources. This goal covers all Amazon businesses, including operations facilities, corporate offices, physical stores, AWS data centers, and all financially integrated subsidiaries that support hundreds of millions of customers globally.

# Our Progress

In 2022, three new on-site rooftop solar projects became operational at Japanese fulfillment centers, increasing the number of facilities with on-site solar in Japan to six. In October 2022, we opened our first stand-alone Australian sort center in Melbourne, which features 3,078 on-site solar panels with capacity to meet up to 80% of the site’s electricity needs. We also announced on-site solar projects in Canada, France, and Germany throughout the year.

# Scaling Renewable Energy

In 2022, 90% of electricity consumed by Amazon was attributable to renewable energy sources, up from 85% in 2021. We grew our renewables portfolio to over 20 GW of clean energy capacity, a 67% increase from our global 2021 portfolio of just over 12 GW. Once operational, these contracted renewable energy projects will account for 56,881 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of Amazon’s electricity use, enough to power 5.3 million U.S. homes annually. With these continued investments, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year, and we remain the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy for the third year in a row.

# Utility-Scale Projects

During 2022, we announced 133 new renewable energy projects that are expected to come online over the next five years, bringing our total announced projects to 401 as of January 2023. Notably, for off-site projects, we announced our first South American project, a 122-MW solar farm in Brazil. Newly announced Indian solar projects—which bring our total number of utility-scale renewable projects in India to six—are expected to have capacity of 920 MW once operational. We also announced our first utility-scale renewable energy projects in Indonesia and Poland. Utility-scale projects in the U.S., Japan, Germany, Finland, France, Poland, Singapore, and Spain were also announced in 2022.

* This table includes both on-site solar and contracted off-site utility-scale wind and solar projects, which are in various stages of development and construction. Twenty-five of the projects included in the table were announced in January 2023.

Several previously announced projects became operational for the first time in 2022. In New South Wales, Australia, two solar farms became operational and are predicted to collectively generate 372,750 megawatt-hours (MWh) annually. Five projects in Europe—two solar farms in Spain and Italy and three wind farms in Sweden and the UK—went live and together are expected to generate 1,980,000 MWh annually. Two projects in China, one wind farm and one solar farm, also launched and are expected to produce 450,500 MWh annually.

We invest in energy storage to collect and save clean energy for use when renewable energy sources are unavailable—such as at night or during periods of high demand—and to provide grid stability. During 2022, we launched solar projects paired with battery storage capabilities in Arizona and California. Together, the projects deliver 450 MW of energy, alongside 225 MW of battery storage. Across our portfolio, we now hold 445 MW of storage capacity. We are looking to increasingly pair renewable generators with storage to provide near 24/7 carbon-free electricity on grids with significant solar.

While storage solutions have the potential to meet energy requirements when supply isn’t readily available, current constraints, such as high costs, mean we continue to pilot storage on a small scale.

# Driving Climate Solutions | Renewable Energy

# Energy Optimization

Throughout 2022, we expanded AWS’ machine learning solution, renewable energy optimization (REO), to improve the performance of our renewable portfolio. REO prioritizes delivery of clean energy where it’s needed most. A dedicated REO team leverages AWS Cloud technology to optimize wind and solar portfolio performance with near real-time monitoring of renewable energy projects. By 2025, we expect technologies like this could deliver additional clean energy equivalent to a 200-MW wind farm when deployed across Amazon’s portfolio.

We also set a goal to invest in wind and solar farm capacity for Amazon Devices equal to the energy used by all Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices worldwide by 2025. At the end of 2022, we contracted enough renewable energy capacity through new wind and solar farms to equal the expected energy use of devices globally in 2025. Some of these farms are operational today, and others are currently under construction and expected to begin operating in 2023–2024.

We seek to reduce emissions by encouraging Amazon device suppliers to use renewable energy and reduce manufacturing emissions. We also look to mitigate device-related emissions during the downstream use phase. To achieve this, we are taking steps to purchase renewable energy that matches customer electricity use associated with Amazon devices.

Learn more about Amazon devices and how we are encouraging suppliers to decarbonize through renewable energy. For example, in Indonesia, we plan to buy electricity from third-party solar parks being installed in Bali and Java and connected to the Java-Madura-Bali grid. Not only will this help renewably power our local operations, it will also support Indonesia’s goal to increase the use of renewables.

# Emissions First Accounting Principles

During 2022, Amazon helped to launch the Emissions First Partnership, a coalition that is playing an increasingly important role in the standards that govern how we account for and reduce the world’s carbon footprint. The principles outline four areas for accounting frameworks:

- Prioritize decarbonization
- Value grid decarbonization progress
- Incentivize innovation in the emissions data ecosystem
- Enhance emissions accounting governance

With the introduction of more renewable energy options into electrical grids globally, the variability of generation mixes increases, resulting in carbon emissions that vary substantially based on time and location. With this in mind, it’s more important than ever that decision-makers opt for renewable electricity options that maximize emissions reductions. Making the right electricity choices relies on accurately understanding the most significant decarbonization opportunities.

# Advocating for Renewable Energy Solutions

Amazon seeks to accelerate global adoption of cleaner energy options through public policy engagement. In the U.S., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is driving efforts to modernize the electricity grid. This work is important because grid-enhancing technologies (GETs) can bring renewables to more people by unlocking capacity and improving efficiency. GETs also complement the advancement of new transmission infrastructure. Combined, this means faster, more cost-effective deployment of clean energy.

# Looking Forward

We will continue exploring ways to renewably power our operations, introducing new wind, solar, and storage projects to reduce our reliance on carbon-based energy sources. Throughout 2023, we will identify new technologies that accelerate renewable energy deployment and, ultimately, help us achieve our net-zero carbon emissions goal. We will also engage additional device component suppliers to establish renewable-energy implementation plans.

# Reducing Packaging and Waste | Packaging

# Our Approach

Our customers want right-sized, easily recyclable packaging that minimizes waste and ensures damage-free delivery. Wherever we operate, circumstances such as geography, available technologies, weather conditions, and delivery vehicle types create unique complexities we must consider to develop effective packaging approaches. We believe packaging is waste to be eliminated and have defined priority actions that start with avoiding unnecessary packaging:

- Our first priority is to eliminate packaging unless necessary. We strive to not give waste to our customers.
- When packaging is required, we optimize with lighter, right-sized packaging to reduce waste and carbon, while ensuring products arrive safely.
- We strive to use packaging materials that are curbside recyclable and have a lower carbon footprint.
- We partner with industry peers to create and scale solutions quickly.

# Our Progress

# Eliminating Packaging

One of our first priorities has been to eliminate the use of additional Amazon packaging. We are also taking targeted actions to find ways to minimize carbon emissions, increase recyclability, and reduce waste.

# Ships In Own Container

Sometimes the best solution is to use what already exists. That’s the idea behind our SIOC approach, in which eligible items are delivered in the original manufacturer’s packaging without additional Amazon delivery packaging. In 2022, SIOC accounted for 11% of packages globally, including:

- 12% of shipments in the U.S. and Canada (up from 10% in 2021)
- 7% of shipments in the EU (up from 5% in 2021)

We believe many products can be shipped without added packaging. We are expanding SIOC by identifying, evaluating, and certifying items already packaged in materials suitable for shipping. Externally, we engage and incentivize selling partners and vendors to re-engineer packaging to meet SIOC standards.

Optimizing with Lighter, More Flexible, and Right-Sized Packaging

With millions of products and an infinite number of order combinations, identifying the optimal packaging size to keep each unique order safe during transit represents a significant challenge. We use machine learning algorithms to determine the best packaging solution for each order we fulfill. These cutting-edge algorithms help reduce empty space in packages. Computer vision and natural language processing guide our system to pinpoint the optimal packaging type for each item—from bag to box—depending on the level of protection needed.

Where possible, we use lightweight packaging by prioritizing flexible paper bags and envelopes, which are up to 90% lighter than similar-sized, rigid corrugate boxes.

We work backward from the customer to identify solutions that enhance their experience and improve the environmental performance of our packaging. Throughout 2022, we scaled automation capabilities to optimize and right-size our packaging selections. By automating our processes, we can also simplify operations, enhancing employee safety and overall productivity.

# Reducing Packaging and Waste | Packaging

# Minimizing Packaging Waste

Automated, right-sized packaging is key to advancing our sustainability efforts; where it isn’t possible, we seek to optimize the packaging size and weight options our fulfillment centers can choose from.

# Prioritizing Recyclability

We have developed a web-based tool to minimize waste by equipping each fulfillment center with an optimized suite of packaging options. These mechanisms use complex algorithms to identify the best package options. The tool is now used in Amazon fulfillment centers globally to reduce waste.

We seek to increase recycling rates for Amazon packaging and strive to enable curbside recyclability where available. We use several packaging options to optimize for durability, performance, and recyclability. These include paper-based options, like boxes and paperboard envelopes, and plastic film options, like plastic bags and air pillows.

In 2022, we joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s BOTTLE18 consortium, led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to develop technology that will enable bio-based and biodegradable plastic recycling. This is the beginning of a new path to make plastics with the benefits of paper, enabling lighter-weight packaging with lower carbon emissions.

# Looking Forward

We remain committed to enhancing our packaging for both performance and sustainability. We have made notable progress to date and, as we move through 2023 and beyond, we will seek to continue eliminating packaging through SIOC, reduce waste through automation and right-sizing, and select recyclable materials where possible.

We are phasing out padded bags containing plastics in favor of recyclable alternatives. During 2022, we expanded recyclable paper padded bag use across the U.S. and Canada, replacing 99% of harder-to-recycle padded bags that contain both plastic and paper. We eliminated single-use plastic delivery bags for orders shipped from European fulfillment centers and replaced them with curbside-recyclable alternatives. We also eliminated single-use air pillows in Europe and Australia and replaced them with curbside-recyclable paper material.

We leverage technology to right-size packaging for deliveries. Today, approximately 92% of packaging material weight in the U.S. and Canada—excluding produce bags and coolants—is curbside recyclable where programs are available. All EU one-way delivery packaging—excluding coolants—is also curbside recyclable.

Global natural resource extraction has more than tripled since 1970 and continues to increase, placing unsustainable pressure on the planet. Creating a circular economy, where waste is eliminated, resources are circulated, and nature is regenerated, is critical to transitioning to a more sustainable future. Amazon is working to send more materials back into the circular economy loop. Most of our potential waste comes from customer fulfillment operations, from materials that become obsolete in our supply chain or from surplus inventory, including items that are overstocked, returned, cosmetically damaged, or near expiration. We work hard to reduce waste wherever possible.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Reducing Packaging and Waste | Waste and Circularity

# Our Approach

The best way to reduce waste is to avoid creating it in the first place through waste-prevention programs and optimized inventory management. By creating a circular economy for materials and products, not only can we keep valuable resources in use for longer, but we can also reduce related impacts such as carbon emissions and environmental pollution.

# Avoiding and Managing Waste

Direct waste is produced inside Amazon’s organizational boundaries; indirect waste is generated by third parties (e.g., suppliers, customers). We are working to eliminate waste and increase recycling and reuse across our business. We are also optimizing product design and providing our customers with opportunities to repair, resell, recycle, and repurpose products and materials.

# Amazon’s Approach for Materials Use

This waste hierarchy is a framework that helps guide our approach to managing and avoiding waste. It represents the most preferred option at the top to the least preferred at the bottom. We are focused on reducing our impact by pursuing opportunities that are more preferred before moving down the hierarchy.

|Avoid|Reduce|Reuse|Recycle|Incineration with Energy Recovery|Landfill and Incineration Without Energy Recovery|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|We improve product and packaging design, inventory management, materials sourcing, and resource use to avoid or eliminate waste generation from the start.|We pursue avenues such as increased product durability and resale to reduce waste.|Where possible, we repair, repurpose, and donate usable items.|We recycle and compost to recover raw materials where possible, including food waste.|Where avoidance, reduction, reuse, or recycling aren’t possible, we target energy recovery.|This is a last resort for materials and products that currently cannot be diverted to better recovery pathways.|

# Waste Generation Categories

Waste is generated in both our direct operations, including some subsidiaries, and in our supply chain. We classify it by two categories: internal (direct) or external (indirect).

# Internal (Direct) Waste

This covers any waste from Amazon’s internal operations and falls into two categories: noninventory and inventory (product).

- Noninventory materials streams: This includes nonproduct material (i.e., goods not intended to generate revenue) that is discarded. This includes used office furniture, corrugate, shrink wrap, break room waste, and damaged storage equipment.
- Inventory materials streams: This includes heavily damaged and unsold products, customer returns that cannot be repaired, food that is no longer safe for consumption, unused nonfood inventory, and goods that cannot be donated, sold via wholesalers, or sold on Amazon Warehouse.

# Customer Waste

Waste generated at the customer product-use phase or in the form of product and delivery packaging, including end-of-life impacts.

# Construction Waste

Waste generated from construction activities related to building our facilities. Consists mainly of comingled construction and demolition waste like metals, masonry, asphalt, and drywall.

# Supply Chain Waste

In addition to our direct footprint, we are focused on reducing supply chain waste, which is waste generated by third-party suppliers who manufacture products for, and provide goods and services to, Amazon.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Reducing Packaging and Waste | Waste and Circularity

# Our Progress

# Operational Waste

Operational waste is what we can most directly control and impact. We manage operational waste generated across our business, including grocery, retail, e-commerce, office buildings, and data centers.

We take a circular approach to equipment, designing for reusability and operational efficiency, and recovering value through reuse, repair, and recycling. This allows us to keep resources at their highest value for as long as possible—reducing waste generation from our global operations, and decreasing the use of raw materials and carbon emissions across our supply chain. We are focused on three priorities:

- Design: At AWS, server rack circularity and sustainability begin with design. We focus on eliminating excess materials such as steel or plastic, increasing recycled and bio-based content, and planning for repair, reuse, and recycling from the start.
- Operate: Using our equipment for as long as operationally efficient reduces the carbon footprint associated with using hardware. In 2022, we extended AWS server life from four years to five and that of networking equipment from five years to six. In addition, AWS has a robust maintenance and repair program designed to increase component reuse and further reduce carbon emissions and waste across our supply chain.
- Recover: When it is time for server racks to be decommissioned, sanitized equipment is routed to our reverse logistics hubs in the U.S. and Ireland. These hubs test, repair, and recirculate non-media-storage equipment for resale, reuse, repair, or donation. We maximize product recovery through discount channels, such as Outlet, Amazon Warehouse, and selling to wholesalers.

# Customer Returns and Damaged Items

Amazon puts returned items through a detailed inspection process, and if the product meets our high quality standards, the item is tagged as “new” and relisted for sale. In 2022, most customer returns in Europe and the U.S. were eligible to be resold as new. Items that are not new are returned to vendors and the rest are graded and evaluated for resale as “used” on Amazon Warehouse. In 2022, 31% of units in Europe and 29% of units in the U.S. that were not able to be resold as “new” were relisted on Amazon Warehouse. Additionally, a global warehouse damage-reduction plan resulted in an 8% decrease in damaged items worldwide in 2022.

# Customer Returns Avoidance

We want to help customers keep what they bought for as long as possible with Product Lifecycle Support (PLS) options that let people address post-purchase product issues. We currently offer three free post-purchase care options: original equipment manufacturer (OEM) support and OEM repair, where customers can go straight to the manufacturer for support; Self Service, which helps customers address issues themselves; and parts replacement, where customers can request available components to replace damaged or missing parts, free of charge. In 2022, PLS programs helped avoid 7.5 million returned units in the U.S. and Europe.

# Inventory Management

Amazon inventory management primarily involves items returned by customers, damaged in handling, or that are overstock. Items that fit these descriptions are considered.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Reducing Packaging and Waste | Waste and Circularity

Overstock: If we cannot sell a product, our first action is to return it to the vendor for resale through a different channel. In 2022, 79% of overstock products in Europe and 64% of overstock products in the U.S. were returned to the original vendor. Where this isn’t feasible, we offer items at a discount on our Outlet storefront or sell them to wholesalers.

# Food Waste

We became one of the Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2020, and extended our commitment to reducing food waste to our Europe operations in 2021. Additionally, in early 2023, Amazon UK signed on to the WRAP and IGD Food Waste Reduction Roadmap.

All U.S. and European Amazon Fresh stores, as well as Amazon Fresh distribution centers in Europe, divert food waste to organic recycling services, including those that support composting or anaerobic digestion. Whole Foods Market is committed to minimizing food waste that ends up in landfill by distributing it to more-sustainable streams such as composting, animal feed, or anaerobic digestion. In 2022, Whole Foods Market had active organic diversion programs at 449 locations, which collectively diverted nearly 108,000 tons of food waste from landfills.

# Customer Waste

We want to reduce waste throughout our value chain. This requires looking downstream to customers and considering how we can help them sustainably use the items they buy from Amazon. Amazon helps customers keep items in use for longer through repair, refurbishment, resale as pre-owned, or recycling. We offer several routes to support product circularity, as part of our wider Amazon Second Chance program, including Amazon Trade-In and Amazon Device Recycling.

# Preventing and Redirecting Food Waste

Our approach to food waste prioritizes optimizing product selection, management, and distribution systems to reduce excess inventory. Where we do have surplus, we look to offer discounts on items at risk of becoming waste. We also take steps to maximize donations.

# Construction and Demolition Waste

We aim to reduce construction and demolition waste from building projects. To do this, we leverage our design template provision and contractual agreements to ensure contractors manage construction waste in accordance with legal requirements and our own high standards for management approach and requirements. Where possible, we also include requirements that encourage minimizing waste in the first place and the reuse of construction materials to reduce waste generation.

When items are broken, unsafe, regulated, or unfeasible for sale or donation via any other pathway, we recycle as much as possible.

# ReCommerce

We have extended ReCommerce services to sellers; through this service we grade and resell, liquidate, or donate their returned, damaged, or overstocked products. In 2022, we enabled U.S. third-party sellers to resell 2.9 million “used” items. We also supported third-party sellers in Europe and the U.S. in selling more than 120 million items for wholesale and donating 107.8 million items. The Amazon recyclable, paper-based packaging helps our customers divert waste from landfill.

We donate surplus food items to those who need them most. In 2022, across the U.S. and Europe, we took various steps to maximize donations, including implementing key process improvements. In the UK, we initiated partnerships for short-shelf-life and other difficult-to-donate items. By the end of the year, we had donated 82 million meals globally—70 million meals in the U.S. and 12 million in Europe.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Reducing Packaging and Waste | Waste and Circularity

# Supply Chain Waste

We engage suppliers to reduce waste related to the manufacture of Amazon devices. We also support them with dematerialization—reducing material use in the items we procure. For example, our Devices teams are engaging suppliers to reduce waste and material use as part of our work to minimize environmental impacts associated with manufacturing.

# Looking Forward

Eliminating waste across Amazon is an ongoing journey. In 2023, we will continue to scale waste-reduction and product-circularity programs across our own operations, as well as throughout our supply chain and customer areas.

In 2021, we launched a Zero Waste to Landfill program with 10 device supplier sites; in 2022, we expanded it to certify all China-based final assembly sites that manufacture our most popular Echo, Kindle, Fire tablet, and Fire TV devices. Other sites covered by the program include manufacturers of device accessories, components, and packaging. In 2022, 12 new sites were certified, bringing our total number of certified supplier sites to 22 at the end of 2022, all of which have achieved UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill certification at Silver or better.

# Partnering for Circularity

Creating a global circular economy for products requires industry collaboration. In 2022, we expanded our partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. We also support the development of a sorting technology to improve plastic packaging recycling through our involvement in the Digital Watermarks Initiative HolyGrail 2.0, driven by AIM—European Brands Association and powered by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste.

Annapurna Labs in Austin, Texas, where AWS chips are made. In 2022, we joined 4evergreen—a cross-industry alliance working to increase fiber-based packaging recycling—as well as the Circular Economy for Flexible Packaging (CEFLEX) industry consortium. In Europe, we are partnering with WRAP.

# Protecting Natural Resources | Water

# Water

Access to water is a fundamental human right, but the United Nations (UN) estimates that by 2050, 52% of the global population will live in water-stressed areas. This poses potential health and economic risks for Amazon’s employees, customers, communities, and business. Amazon is taking action to address these risks across our operations and value chain.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Protecting Natural Resources | Water

# Our Approach

We take a proactive approach to water stewardship, analyzing our footprint, driving operational resilience, and building more-efficient systems that reduce our impact on local water sources. Different businesses use water in different ways, and water risk varies significantly across geographies. We are investing in data insights with the aim of designing a water program that can be tailored to unique geographic and business unit needs.

For example, AWS has a goal to be water positive by 2030 through increasing water availability at and around operational sites. We will achieve this by improving efficiency, using more-sustainable sources such as recycled water, returning water for community reuse, and supporting replenishment projects.

# Our Progress

Accomplishing our goal requires cross-team collaboration, with input from engineers, operations experts, commissioning professionals, and those with sustainability oversight.

# Water Sources

To meet our AWS water positive goal, we are focusing on four strategies:

- Increase water efficiency
- Use more-sustainable sources
- Reuse cooling water
- Invest in water replenishment

# Amazon’s Water Usage

Our global water use includes water used both in direct operations and in our wider supply chain. Water is used in various ways across our facilities. For example:

- Data centers: primarily use water in server-cooling processes.
- Operations: use water in break rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and landscape irrigation, particularly fulfillment centers, sort centers, and delivery stations.
- Physical stores (Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh): primarily use water to clean and defrost foods.
- Offices: mainly use water in office kitchens, bathrooms, and landscape irrigation.

# Increasing Water Efficiency

We are continuing to invest in data center water use efficiency (WUE) in three ways. It begins with our preferred efficient evaporative cooling design, which uses outside air rather than water to cool data centers for much of the year. During hotter months when water is needed, outside air is cooled through evaporative processes and pushed into server rooms to keep hardware at stable operating temperatures. Second, we incorporate real-time alarm systems to enable timely responses to any issues that could cause water waste. Finally, we update operational sequences to optimize water use and employ on-site water treatment to increase water recycling.

With this strategy, our global data center WUE was 0.19 L/kWh in 2022, a 24% improvement from 0.25 L/kWh in 2021.

# Reusing Cooling Water

Water discharged from data centers is safe for many uses, and we seek ways to return it to the communities in which we operate. To confirm water quality is maintained, we closely monitor it throughout our systems.

# Investing in Water Replenishment

We are focused on restoring watersheds and increasing access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services in water-stressed communities. In 2022, AWS completed projects with Water.org and WaterAid to provide clean water and sanitation to over 290,000 people across India and Indonesia.

Amazon is also partnering with Water.org to launch the Water & Climate Fund. The initiative will enable climate-resilient water and sanitation solutions that create lasting access to safe clean drinking water from an Amazon and Water.org project.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Protecting Natural Resources | Water

We achieved this WNI score, in part, by designing buildings with rainwater-harvesting systems. Additionally, these facilities recycle greywater—water from domestic streams such as sinks, cafeterias, and washrooms—for irrigation and flushing water for toilets. More-efficient fixtures such as waterless urinals and water restrainers for high-flow fixtures contribute to a reduction in washroom consumption. In all future sites in India, we plan to include rainwater-harvesting pits and meters, water-recycling systems, and efficient fixtures. We aim to improve data accuracy and will begin implementing a water use index, which tracks water consumption in relation to building footprint.

India is one of the world’s most water-stressed countries. To reduce water use in India operations, we have an active stewardship program and have adopted the Water Neutrality Index (WNI) as a key metric. As of 2022, India operations achieved a WNI score of 1 for 212 in-scope operations facilities and aims to achieve water positivity for these same facilities in 2023.

In the United Kingdom (UK), we are piloting a rainwater-harvesting system in Wales, while installation of low-flow fixtures is underway across new and existing fulfillment sites. In 2021, UK operational facilities implemented an active water leak detection program to proactively identify and address issues. Planning is underway to scale this pilot globally.

# Physical Stores

By the end of 2022, 38 Whole Foods Market stores installed a new defrosting system that recycles meltwater instead of allowing it to run down the drain. This new system can reduce up to 98.5% of water use associated with defrosting. In 2023, we are assessing the potential to scale this technology to other Whole Foods Market stores.

# Corporate Offices

In global corporate offices, we are increasing water recycling and low-flow fixtures. Amazon set new standards for construction design in the U.S. to reduce indoor water use by 40% versus a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) baseline. We are scaling these standards globally.

A company’s activities impact the lives of millions of people around the globe. Even small businesses can have value chains that span dozens of countries. While states are responsible for protecting human rights, the private sector has a critical responsibility to respect and promote human and labor rights through responsible business conduct. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) set the global standard for identifying and addressing business-related human rights risks. Embedding respect for human rights in how a company conducts business is essential for meeting the expectations of governments, shareholders, civil society, and customers.

Twitch published its human rights impact assessment (HRIA).

# Our Approach

From the associates in our fulfillment centers, to the drivers delivering packages to our customers, to the factory workers making the products we sell—people are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. Amazon is committed to treating our own employees, and people connected to our entire value chain, with fundamental dignity and respect. We strive to embed respect for human rights throughout our business activities and relationships. In line with Amazon’s Leadership Principles, we use our global scale and influence to drive progress on salient human rights issues across our operations and value chain.

Our human rights strategy is informed by leading international standards and frameworks developed by the UN and the International Labour Organization (ILO). Amazon is committed to respecting and supporting the UNGPs, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Core Conventions of the ILO, and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our approach is codified in our Global Human Rights Principles, a set of standards that demonstrate our support for fundamental human rights and the dignity of people connected to our business around the world. We regularly review these and other relevant policies to identify areas for improvement, a process supported by engagement with external stakeholders and benchmarking against evolving international and industry human rights standards.

# Our Strategy

Our strategy has five pillars:

- Developing and maintaining strong policies and standards
- Embedding human rights into our business operations and decision-making
- Assessing, prioritizing, and addressing risk
- Engaging with stakeholders, including supply chain workers, employees and contractors, customers, and communities
- Improving access to effective grievance mechanisms and remediation procedures

We have a central team that works across the company to conduct human rights due diligence and embed human rights considerations into everyday business decisions. With support from this central team, Amazon businesses are working toward integrating our human rights principles into their operations and business relationships, conducting human rights risk assessments, and remedying identified issues.

We worked with Article One, a business and human rights consulting firm, to complete an enterprisewide human rights saliency assessment in 2020. Through that process, we identified nine salient human rights risks across our operations and business relationships. Since then, we have built on this foundation, performing HRIAs across a number of Amazon businesses to gain deeper understanding of our salient issues.

# Our Progress

# Human Rights Impact Assessments

As we continue to improve and expand our human rights due diligence practices, we leverage HRIAs to assess and address risks connected to our operations and business relationships. HRIAs help us understand causes of systemic issues, enhance ongoing engagement with critical stakeholders, and facilitate increasingly transparent disclosures.

In 2022, Twitch conducted its first HRIA in partnership with Amazon’s central human rights team and consulting firm BSR. Twitch is an Amazon subsidiary that provides interactive livestreaming services for content spanning gaming, entertainment, sports, music, and more. The HRIA identified the most salient human rights risks and opportunities related to Twitch’s services, including content governance and online safety, incorporating a focus on vulnerable groups.

# Actions Taken in 2022

- Updated supplier standards
- Conducted and socialized supplier assessments and performance reporting
- Implemented human rights impact and saliency assessments
- Consulted key stakeholders and focused on vulnerable groups
- Enhanced opportunities for concerns to be heard and issues resolved

# Meaningful Consultation with Stakeholders

We recognize many human rights risks are systemic in nature—complex issues that can have widespread social impacts. We also recognize addressing them requires cross-industry engagement and collaboration to find effective solutions. Throughout 2022, we drew on strategic partnerships in priority areas. For example, to advance our efforts to promote women’s climate leadership, we became a founding member of the Climate Resolute Coalition, organized by The Mara Partners and Kite Insights to advance gender equality and reduce carbon emissions across global supply chains. We also made a founding investment in the Climate Gender Equity Fund.

# Human Rights Risks Identified

The HRIA identified the following human rights risks based on scope, scale, remediability, likelihood, and priority:

|Tier 1|Bodily Security Rights; Child Rights; Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, and Access to Information; Right to Freedom of Thought, Belief, and Religion; and Right to Privacy|
|---|---|
|Tier 2|Right to Access to Culture and Right to Own Property; Right to Equality and Non-Discrimination; Right to Participate in Government|
|Tier 3|Right to Peaceful Assembly and Association; Right to Education|

To drive greater focus on human rights throughout our supply chain, we engaged with organizations like the Indirect Spend Alliance, Better Cotton Working Group on Decent Work & Gender, the Open Supply Hub, and the Responsible Sourcing Network’s YESS initiative.

We also established new partnerships to address health care issues and crisis response. We partnered with the international nonprofit PATH to train Amazon suppliers in Vietnam to improve crisis response and mental health care. We also created a learning hub so suppliers and their workers could more easily access important health information.

# Respecting Human Rights | Human Rights

PATH to support mental health screening for 12,600 workers and their families and occupational health screenings for 6,300 workers—enhancing safe and healthy working conditions across our Vietnamese supplier network.

As we move forward, we will continue consulting key stakeholders, building regional partner networks to support local human rights initiatives, and engaging global partners on Amazon’s priority issues.

Learn more about our human rights progress.

# Looking Forward

Respecting human rights is core to how we do business at Amazon, today and in the future. We will create more opportunities for employees and business partners to learn about human rights at Amazon, empowering them to take action and build human rights protections into their everyday work. Externally, we will continue to consult with stakeholders, seek high-impact strategic partnerships that help us deliver on our priorities, and collaborate with others to raise the bar for human rights across the industry.

# Partnering to Address Human Trafficking

Amazon is a member of the steering committee for Tech Against Trafficking, a coalition of companies collaborating with global experts to help eradicate human trafficking using technology. In 2022, Amazon hosted the inaugural Tech Against Trafficking Summit, an event where over 150 global anti-trafficking leaders discussed opportunities for increased collaboration and technology-enabled solutions. From 2021 to 2022, we supported the second Tech Against Trafficking Accelerator, providing technical expertise to support two anti-trafficking nonprofits. In 2022, Tech Against Trafficking also announced its third Accelerator and is supporting Polaris’s Nonechka program and the Issara Institute. Amazon seeks to accelerate the scale and impact of these organizations’ technology solutions throughout 2023.

# Respecting Human Rights | Responsible Supply Chain

Our Approach

Our goal is to realize safe, equitable, fair, and sustainable supply chains across all our businesses. We want to create long-term supplier relationships that align with our values, and we are committed to continually improving conditions. To achieve this, we regularly evaluate human rights risks in our supply chain, assessing both site-level and systemic industrywide risks. We then work closely with suppliers, leaning on strategic partnerships and capacity-building programs to drive improvement across our priority commitment areas:

- Safe and healthy workplaces
- Gender equity
- Fair wages
- Responsible recruitment and freely chosen employment
- Environmental protection
- Access to effective grievance mechanisms

We recognize addressing supply chain risks requires a collaborative approach, which is why we work through many industry associations and multistakeholder initiatives around the world to advance our goals on human rights and responsible sourcing. In 2022, we joined the Indirect Spend Alliance (ISA), a new industry working group that aims to identify areas of shared human rights risk in procurement, designing a single industry approach to address hot spots. Through quarterly group meetings and monthly workshops, the ISA is working to produce a collaborative, structured, and scalable approach to identification, assessment, and issue remediation for environmental and social risks in indirect spend categories. To maximize impact, the ISA is initially focusing on high-priority categories common to members, including construction, recycling and waste services, warehousing, haulage, couriers, and facilities.

We added several new elements to our standards too, including:

- Legal parental leave policies
- Protections for workers with disabilities
- Pregnancy-related accommodations
- Workers’ freedom to terminate employment without penalty
- An environmental justice provision that encourages suppliers to assess and address environmental equity issues

# Aligning Selling Partners with Our Standards

Selling partners are retail vendors and third-party sellers that sell products and services in Amazon’s stores. Our Supply Chain Standards apply to every product and service provided to Amazon or sold in our stores. We encourage selling partners to perform human rights and environmental due diligence to help ensure products and services are produced and supplied in ways that respect human rights and the environment and protect the fundamental dignity of workers.

We evaluate all credible allegations of selling partner violations of our Supply Chain Standards. If we have reason to suspect products don’t meet our standards, we may request due diligence from selling partners to demonstrate products were manufactured in accordance with Amazon’s Supply Chain Standards. We reserve the right to remove products that don’t meet those standards from our stores.

Amazon’s Supply Chain Standards are applicable to all our suppliers and help to advance our commitment to respecting human rights.

# Respecting Human Rights | Responsible Supply Chain

# Our Progress

# Safe and Healthy Workplaces

We work with suppliers globally to increase worker awareness of safety issues. This includes promoting a culture of shared safety responsibility and developing initiatives to support worker well-being.

During 2022, we maintained our involvement with the ILO’s Sustaining Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) program to improve productive, healthy, and safe working environments among small- and medium-sized manufacturers. Three criteria guided how we selected suppliers for inclusion in the training:

- Strategic suppliers as defined by our business units
- Suppliers identified as having high-risk health and safety issues in previous audits
- Suppliers with a workforce of fewer than 1,000 employees—smaller organizations in which training can have marked positive impact on productivity and working conditions

By the end of 2022, 62 suppliers were enrolled in the SCORE training across China, India, and Vietnam (versus 50 in 2021), cumulatively delivering nearly 42,000 hours of training. Third-party assessments before and after the training participation identified key improvements in workplace health and safety, productivity, and worker satisfaction as well as a reduction in accidents.

# Improving Supplier Health

We are committed to helping suppliers keep their people safe and healthy. In collaboration with Catalyst Management Services, Amazon worked to support suppliers in Bangladesh by providing a medical hotline for workers and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also helped factories establish crisis-response plans. From December 2021 to March 2023, we provided access to critical health care services for over 40,000 workers.

Learn more about how we embed health and safety considerations into our own workplace culture.

# Gender Equity in Our Supply Chains

Gender equity is a fundamental human right and a necessary foundation of sustainable supply chains. We seek to engage with more women-owned businesses throughout our supply chains and to support women in making their own decisions on health, finances, and career development. Achieving gender equity will require embedding it across all areas and levels of our business, as well as incorporating it into all human rights due diligence and activities such as human rights impact assessments.

In 2022, we took several steps to advance gender equity, including:

- Joining the International Center for Research on Women’s (ICRW) Gender Equity Worker Engagement Group (GEWEG). We joined to co-finance harmonized, gender-responsive worker voice and employee engagement tools—including a comprehensive set of e-learning modules for suppliers on gender equity.
- Participating in the Better Cotton Working Group on Decent Work & Gender.
- Joining the Resilience Fund for Women in Global Value Chains to support women-led organizations committed to tackling systemic gender-based issues.

# Fair Wages

Ensuring workers receive fair pay remains a global, cross-industry issue. Amazon is working to gain a better understanding of wage payments throughout our supply chains to inform more meaningful supplier engagements and enhance our human rights due diligence processes.

In 2022, we updated our Supply Chain Standards to include stronger expectations around fair wages and benefits. The updates specify requirements on equal pay for equal work and include more specific language on gender equity in pay. We recognize progress on critical issues such as wages and working hours requires us to continually evaluate our own processes, finding ways to improve systems for tracking and addressing fair wages. Responsible purchasing practices are a key part of addressing issues regarding fair wages.

# Improving Health Care Access

In 2022, we continued our partnership in India with Swasti, a global nonprofit committed to ensuring access to quality health care for workers in marginalized communities. Together, we established a helpline and health protocols for workers returning to work after COVID-19. Swasti also delivered critical mental health, health care, and social support to workers, their families, and communities. By the end of 2022, Swasti reached 2,288 workers in Amazon’s India supply chain.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Respecting Human Rights | Responsible Supply Chain

# Responsible Recruitment and Freely Chosen Employment

Forced labor is one of the most complex and challenging human rights issues. It requires a holistic approach, including commitment, resources, and innovative solutions from governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector. Amazon does not tolerate forced labor in our operations or value chain. We partner with external organizations on holistic approaches to combating forced labor and ensuring vulnerable workers, especially foreign migrants, have access to transparent information on working conditions, including pay, hiring practices, and contract terms. We also partner directly with our suppliers to help them establish management systems that protect their workers from forced labor vulnerability.

By the end of 2022, we helped connect 88 sites across seven countries—Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand—with independent grievance mechanisms. Of the 702 worker grievances raised, 95% were verified and resolved. The other 5% were pending or under investigation at the end of the year.

# Access to Effective Worker Voice Mechanisms

We strive to give people opportunities to voice their concerns in a safe and confidential manner. To do this, we connect suppliers and service providers with various trusted tools, products, and systems to hear directly from workers about their experiences and support the resolution of issues from workers’ perspectives.

In 2022, 781 worker grievances, of which 576 related to workplace concerns, were reported through the Amader Kotha Helpline, with the top five issues being around benefits, leave, wages, termination, and verbal abuse. Ulula is available to workers in Cambodia, China, India, and Pakistan and, during 2022, wage concerns were the issues most frequently reported.

Whenever grievances are raised through the Amader Kotha Helpline, an independent helpline serving the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh, the organization works with factory management to address and resolve issues as quickly as possible. For example, during 2022, a worker called the Hotline to raise a concern that machinery in one of our production facilities was sparking. The caller requested that the Helpline engage management to ensure immediate action was taken.

Amader Kotha quickly reached out to our supplier’s management, who confirmed they would resolve the issue by replacing the relevant motor immediately. As a result, the issue was resolved within an hour, and is a good example of how Amader Kotha is helping bring about timely remediation to worker concerns and improving working conditions in manufacturing facilities.

# Worker Voice Program

In 2020, we launched a responsible recruitment capacity-building program to support suppliers and workers in preventing and remediating forced labor issues. This includes ending worker-paid recruitment fees—a practice prohibited by our Supply Chain Standards—and requiring suppliers to reimburse any fees paid by workers at any phase of the recruitment process. As of 2022, we enrolled 50 suppliers who were found to use recruitment fees into our program.

Through our Worker Voice program, we gather insights through a variety of methods, including worker surveys, focus group discussions, interviews, and digital tools. The program has five purposes:

- Improving ways that workers in our supply chains can report concerns
- Gaining worker insights
- Providing supplier capacity building to improve their worker engagement and communication systems
- Supporting Amazon businesses to conduct human rights due diligence
- Engaging in industry efforts to establish good practice

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Respecting Human Rights | Responsible Supply Chain

# Focus on Vulnerable Groups

We recognize that, while forced labor can be found among any population, certain groups are particularly vulnerable. We are committed to ending instances of trafficking for those groups, including:

- Domestic and foreign migrants
- Contract, agency, and temporary workers
- Refugees
- Asylum seekers
- Ethnic/religious minorities and displaced persons
- Young or student workers

To 2022, Safer has helped platforms detect nearly 1,230,000 CSAM files. Safer is also made available to AWS customers in the Marketplace to enable them to detect, review, and report CSAM in their own services and resources.

We are also an official corporate sponsor of Truckers Against Trafficking, an organization that exists to educate, equip, and mobilize members of the trucking, bus, and energy industries to combat human trafficking. We incorporate Truckers Against Trafficking modules into trainings for our internal fleet drivers on identifying and responding to potential human trafficking victims. In 2022, we trained more than 4,800 Amazon transportation associates.

In the U.S., Amazon supports Polaris, a nonprofit leading a social justice movement to address sex and labor trafficking. Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivers financial and technical support to enhance Polaris’s data collection and improve trafficking identification and prevention. Since Polaris began operating in 2007, a Trafficking Hotline has handled over 82,000 situations of human trafficking.

We maintained our membership of the Child Rights in Business Working Group led by The Centre for Child Rights and Business. Through this commitment, we worked to design virtual training on child labor prevention and remediation, as well as young worker management, which will be delivered to the central human rights team and key internal stakeholders in 2023.

Learn more in our Modern Slavery Statement.

Learn more about how we are working with Polaris to prevent human trafficking.

Throughout 2022, we maintained our partnership with Thorn, a technology company working to defend children from sexual abuse. Thorn leverages AWS machine learning tools to power its Safer and Spotlight products, using Spotlight to help identify child sex trafficking victims. Thorn’s Safer product helps tech companies detect, identify, and report child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on their content-hosting platforms. From 2018.

# Looking Forward

Building more responsible supply chains is an ongoing endeavor and requires collective effort from Amazon, our suppliers, and a network of expert partners. We will continue to engage partners and suppliers on efforts to progress against our key commitment areas.

Beyond responsible commodity sourcing, Amazon Private Brands is making progress toward measuring environmental impacts in our supply chain and promoting safer chemistry. As part of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, we encourage suppliers to evaluate their practices using the Higg Facility Environmental Module (FEM), a self-assessment which evaluates performance and prioritizes opportunities for improvement across seven impact areas: air emissions, carbon emissions, chemicals management, environmental management systems, waste, wastewater, and water.

In 2022, we developed a responsible sourcing roadmap informed by findings from our first comprehensive commodity risk assessment for Amazon devices and Amazon Private Brands products. The roadmap focuses on key materials, including cotton, wood, pulp, paper, cobalt, and copper, and guides businesses in achieving greater visibility and positive impacts across our supply chains.

In December of 2022, Amazon Private Brands and Whole Foods Market publicly committed to limit deforestation risks in food, grocery, and consumable Private Brands products containing palm oil, soy, paper products, beef, cocoa, coffee, and tea. Additionally, we successfully achieved previously published apparel goals on man-made cellulosic fibers and cotton. To ensure better standards for cotton more widely, we continue to sponsor and participate in the Responsible Sourcing Network’s due diligence initiative, YESS (Yarn Ethically & Sustainably Sourced), to identify and address forced labor in cotton production. In 2022, YESS released its first Standard for Fabric Mills and an updated Standard for Spinning Mills, enhancing efforts to improve cotton supply chain due diligence.

# Product Sustainability

Part of our mission to be Earth’s most customer-centric company is to offer more-sustainable devices without compromising on quality or cost. This includes designing our devices with carbon reduction in mind and manufacturing them using responsibly sourced materials. It also involves confirming the sustainable credentials of our devices with trusted third-party certifications.

We are also working with suppliers to increase their use of renewable energy in manufacturing Amazon devices. Additionally, we worked with suppliers to increase smelter audits and remove nonconformant smelters from our supply chain. We will continue to partner closely with our businesses and engage suppliers and upstream actors on the importance of responsible mineral sourcing auditing mechanisms and smelter certification.

In 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Carbon Trust to establish technical specifications for decarbonizing the use phase of Amazon devices. We will set practical, impactful steps for mitigating emissions at the customer stage of the device lifecycle, aiming to launch a completed standard in 2023.

# Reducing the Carbon Impact of Devices

In 2022, we implemented additional smelter due diligence protocols as we work toward certifying 100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold mineral smelters and refiners in our supply chain using a recognized minerals assurance program.

To deliver high-quality devices that are more sustainable, affordable, and accessible, we incorporate lifecycle assessments into the design process. Through this, we measure carbon emissions at all stages—from production, through customer use, and up to disposal.

We aim for each generation of Amazon devices to be more carbon-efficient than the last. We are also focused on making devices more energy-efficient to reduce emissions associated with customer product use. Today, new devices feature Low Power Mode, and we are delivering updates to introduce this feature for older devices already in customers’ homes. By the end of 2022, over 60% of devices in customers’ homes had Low Power Mode, up from over 50% in 2021.

# Device Materials Sourcing Standards

We seek to deliver more-sustainable devices by continually improving our materials and sourcing standards. We incorporate recycled materials into many new devices. In 2022, we launched Echo, Fire TV, Fire tablet, Kindle, and smart home products that, depending on the item, contain:

• Up to 75% recycled plastic (versus 60% in 2021)• Up to 100% recycled yarn (consistent with 2021)• Up to 100% recycled aluminum (consistent with 2021)

Amazon is increasing recycled content in our devices, including Echo, Fire TV, Fire tablet, Kindle, and smart home products.

# Device Certifications

We partner with trusted, transparent external certifications to validate the sustainability of our products and clearly communicate this to customers through the Climate Pledge Friendly badge. Since 2020, many of our Echo, Fire TV, Fire tablet, Kindle e-reader, and smart home devices and accessories have received sustainability certifications included in the Climate Pledge Friendly program. Many of these products qualified for the Climate Pledge Friendly badge by achieving the Carbon Trust’s Reducing CO2 certification, which highlights products with an associated carbon footprint that is decreasing annually.

# Looking Forward

We are committed to continually improving product sustainability, enhancing responsible materials and commodities sourcing, and collaborating with supply chain partners to drive adoption of new regulations and compliance requirements. To promote responsible sourcing practices more widely, we will continue to advocate for robust standards that limit negative social and environmental impacts. We will also continue to improve device efficiency while delivering new and better ways for customers to shop for more-sustainable products.

# Climate Pledge Friendly

The Amazon Smart Thermostat is the first Amazon device to be ECOLOGO Silver certified, demonstrating it meets standards for reducing environmental impacts at one or more product lifecycle stages. To further reduce the thermostat’s environmental impact, we have also now introduced a new carbon-emissions-optimization feature. By monitoring local grid emissions data in real time, the thermostat can automatically adjust set temperature points to reduce energy use during high-emission periods, such as when grids are using less sustainable power sources.

# Product Certification

As of December 2022, the Climate Pledge Friendly program added 16 certifications, giving selling partners 52 ways to qualify for Climate Pledge Friendly. The new certifications recognize improvements in at least one aspect of sustainability, from recycled content to energy efficiency. This year’s additions include, but are not limited to:

- EU Energy Label grades A and B
- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Design for the Environment and WaterSense
- Fairtrade International
- NATRUE
- STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX
- Business + Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association Level
- GreenCircle

We have enabled 19 shopping features, such as new search functions and clearer digital badges, to highlight Climate Pledge Friendly products. These features have helped Amazon customers switch to a Climate Pledge Friendly product—something that occurs the first time customers purchase a Climate Pledge Friendly product in a category for which they have only purchased non-Climate Pledge Friendly products over the prior two-year period. Customers can now shop for products across Apparel, Home, Electronics, and Kitchen categories, meaning customers now have access to 550,000 Climate Pledge Friendly products, up from 250,000 in 2021.

We have also seen strong adoption of the Climate Pledge Friendly program from Amazon Business customers. Amazon Business helps companies create guided buying policies, which place preference on sustainable products qualified through the Climate Pledge Friendly program. As of December 2022, 18,000 businesses had these buying policies in place.

# Enhancing the Amazon Employee Experience

# Our Progress

# Compensation, Pay

In September 2022, we announced pay increases for U.S. front-line employees, with average pay for those in customer fulfillment and transportation increasing from $18 to $19 per hour—an investment of nearly $1 billion in 2022. This is just one of the ways in which we promote financial success and competitive pay.

# Flexibility, and Financial Support

To make pay access as easy, instant, and flexible as possible, we expanded our wage access program, Anytime Pay, to all employees across U.S. operations, corporate, and technology networks. Previously, most employees received regular pay once or twice monthly; Anytime Pay lets employees access up to 70% of eligible earned pay, whenever and without fees, giving them control of their pay schedule.

# Did You Know?

Anytime Shifts let employees choose their own hours and schedule, bringing more flexibility or structure to their role. This enables caregivers, for example, to have more consistent shifts that work for their specific life needs.

# Pay Equity

We are prioritizing pay equity. A review of 2022 compensation, including base pay, cash bonuses, and stock, shows women in the U.S. earned 99.5 cents, and women globally earned 99.6 cents, for every dollar men earned performing the same jobs. Historically marginalized groups in the U.S. earned 99.5 cents for every dollar white employees earned performing the same jobs.

# Comprehensive and Inclusive Benefits

Alongside comprehensive medical care, we offer inclusive mental health support and, in October 2022, enhanced our U.S. employee assistance program (EAP) to include:

- Increased free counseling sessions: Employees can now access five free counseling sessions per issue annually.
- Enhanced mental health benefits: In the U.S., we offer mental health services for employees’ children in partnership with Brightline, a leading virtual health support provider. Brightline offers confidential, personalized support for those aged 18 months to 17 years—including virtual visits with therapists, psychiatrists, and coaches, plus on-demand resources for parents and caregivers.

This is available to Amazon employees who are enrolled in an Aetna or Premera health plan. Outside the U.S., we’ve worked with EAP partner Workplace Options to bring mental health benefits to 55 new countries. Updates include 24/7 access to licensed clinicians, free counseling and coaching, mindfulness training, and suicide prevention resources.

We recognize people want jobs that fit seamlessly into their lives. To address this, we offer various shift and schedule options, including seasonal work and permanent full- or part-time positions. We also provide morning, day, night, and weekend shifts so people can work the times that best fulfill their needs.

Because we know not everyone has the same routine week to week, as well as providing fixed schedules we offer flexible options that let employees choose when, and how much, to work. Amazon’s Anytime Shifts lets eligible employees choose shift schedules using an app to plan their workweek to suit them. Throughout 2022, more than 100,000 employees opted in to Anytime Shifts, gaining access to more flexible shift plans.

# Workplace Benefits

During the year, we also expanded our global commuter benefits to provide additional services to employees across the globe. For example, where available, Amazon offers benefits including subsidizing public transportation, bike share, bike lease, or bike maintenance costs. As of the end of 2022, employees across 54 countries are eligible for commuter benefits.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Enhancing the Amazon Employee Experience

# Upskilling Our Employees

In 2019, we launched our Upskilling 2025 pledge with a commitment to upskill 100,000 employees by 2025. In 2021, we announced we would triple that commitment by 2025 to provide prepaid education and technical skills training to help 300,000 hourly employees move into higher-paying roles. To achieve this goal, we maintain 10 global upskilling programs with various eligibility requirements. Through these, we offer prepaid education, industry certifications, technical skills training, and apprenticeships to meet employees’ needs, no matter where they are on their professional journeys.

One of the most notable upskilling opportunities we offer is Career Choice, a program providing employees with skills training, professional certificates, language learning, and college degrees. Over 110,000 employees have participated in Career Choice since it launched in 2012, receiving support from a global network of over 400 educational partners. In 2022, we extended Career Choice courses for eligible U.S. employees to include English as a second language (ESL), high school completion programs, and prepaid college tuition. To prepare employees for future environmental sustainability roles, we introduced three new Career Choice pathways that lead to Environmental Technician, Energy Technician, and Solar Technician career opportunities. Employees can also pursue industry certifications for in-demand fields like transportation and environmental sustainability, or a bachelor’s degree with one of our partner schools.

# Employee Engagement

We value employee feedback—both positive sentiments and constructive comments on areas for development. We offer opportunities, from all-hands meetings to one-on-one discussions, for engaging with leaders, raising issues, and suggesting improvements. Associate Roundtables are held regularly for leadership and hourly employees to discuss pressing issues. Associate Forums create opportunities for employees to connect with site leaders on decisions that impact the site or employee experience. In 2022, we held more than 125 forums across the UK, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Spain, and Morocco.

# Employee Feedback Mechanisms

Globally, various sites also have Associate Safety Committees to gather employee input on relevant safety matters. Throughout 2022, nearly 200,000 employees participated in over 10,000 committee meetings, collectively developing nearly 25,000 actions to increase on-site safety.

# Real-Time Employee Feedback Through Connections

Connections is a real-time, companywide feedback mechanism for listening to and learning from employees to improve the employee experience. Employees respond to Connections questions at 5,100 locations in 59 countries. Each day, Connections questions are delivered via computers, workstation devices, and hand scanners. Employees may choose to answer or not answer any question. Individual responses are aggregated and shared with managers at the team level to maintain confidentiality. In a year, Connections receives responses from 4.7 million people.

Employees can access escalation mechanisms through the Ethics Line, executive escalation, their manager, and HR business partners, to name a few. In 2022, we included questions in Punjabi, Dutch, and Urdu for the first time, bringing the total number of available languages to 29.

# Enhancing the Amazon Employee Experience

# Associate Feedback

With our MyVoice online tool—and in-person VOA boards—we are creating a stage for employees to share ideas. Available globally, these options allow employees to voice opinions to leadership teams who will reply directly, enabling quicker, more collaborative issue remediation.

# Freedom of Association

We respect freedom of association and our employees’ right to form, join, or not join labor unions or other lawful organizations of their choosing, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. These rights should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner.

Throughout 2022, we expanded MyVoice to Australia, Singapore, India, China, Brazil, the EU, and Amazon’s Middle East and North Africa region. We also introduced it for new business areas, including Amazon Fresh, Delivery Experience Robotics, and Amazon Data Services. In 2022, we established a European Works Council; we held our first meeting in April 2023. In March 2022, we reaffirmed our position on freedom of association, including our approach to human rights and collective bargaining.

Through MyVoice and VOA boards, we received 389,479 global responses in 2022. By the end of the year, MyVoice achieved a total reach of 91.3% of Amazon Stores globally.

# Appeals

We maintain a defined appeals process. Across the U.S. and Canada, eligible employees can use an online, paperless appeals service to challenge certain disciplinary actions. Claims are reviewed by the applicable manager to verify policies have been correctly applied. Where this is not the case, appropriate remediation can then be taken.

We are continually updating the process and centralizing it across U.S. and Canadian customer fulfillment and sort center operations. During 2022, Amazon Logistics enhanced appeals for hourly employees, making it easier for people to speak up and share their opinions.

# Looking Forward

In the U.S., we are exploring new avenues for supporting employees’ financial health; in Europe, we have set a 2023 benefits roadmap that focuses on health care, finance, and time away from work. And, because every person’s circumstances are unique, we will strive to advance our offering, including family planning tools, to reach employees with the resources they need. We also seek to scale training opportunities, adding additional resources to Career Choice and offering new programs. To prepare more employees for future sustainability roles, we are working to build new pathways for in-demand roles and programs to upskill our workforce.

We continually look to evolve the employee experience. To understand where there’s room for growth, we will enhance engagement channels and identify strategic imperatives. With greater insight into employee sentiment, we can then work on delivering benefits and training opportunities that more closely align with people’s needs.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Improving Employee Health and Safety

# Our Approach

Our goal is to be the safest workplace across the industries in which we operate. We use a risk management approach to guide our prioritization and decision-making, which includes:

- Measuring safety performance to assess program effectiveness and to identify and remove hazards
- Assessing safety processes and adherence to standards through audits and inspections
- Engaging employees to continually improve safety in our operations

# Our Progress

Progress since 2019 is due, in large part, to our long-term strategy for continuous improvement. Many practices that were underway prior to the pandemic—including employee engagement and physical and mental health support—continue to be foundational. And we’ve continued building on them with new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, sensors, and innovative engagement tools and learning methodologies.

# Measuring Safety Performance

Data helps us assess the effectiveness of our efforts and identify potential improvement areas. It also equips operations leaders and safety professionals with measurable, objective insights that support risk detection and mitigation. With this in mind, we track two metrics that help us understand annual safety performance:

- Recordable Incident Rate (RIR): denotes how often an injury or illness occurs at work—measured in injuries per 200,000 working hours—according to local occupational safety and health reporting requirements.
- Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR): measures the number of injuries and illnesses per 200,000 working hours that result in time away from work.

# Safety Performance

| |U.S. RIR:|Worldwide RIR:|
|---|---|---|
|2019|8.7|5.7|
|2020|7.6|5.1|
|2021|6.5|4.0|
|2022|6.7|2.6|

As well as reducing RIR and LTIR, we work every day to help prevent injuries and tragedies, such as fatalities, in our workplaces. Sadly, sometimes they do occur from personal health causes, natural disasters, and work-related activity. In 2022, we lost three Amazon employees in the U.S. to work-related fatalities, which is defined as an occupational injury or disease sustained or contracted during an employee’s tenure with their employer. We provide support and counseling to any employee who may need it following such a tragedy. In each instance, we conduct thorough internal investigations, implement corrective actions, and work with regulatory authorities as they conduct their own independent reviews.

# Safety Metrics

When examining 2022 against 2019, we are proud to report our global RIR has improved by 24%, while global LTIR improved by 53%. Between 2021 and 2022 alone, we improved RIR by 11% and LTIR by 14%. Of recordable incidents reported in 2022, about 55% resulted from work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The remaining 45% were primarily due to slips, trips, falls, and falling objects.

# Improving Employee Health and Safety

# Assessing Safety Processes

Audits and inspections assure that effective resources and protocols are in place for identifying, eliminating, or controlling safety hazards. During inspections, we check that our safety measures and controls are working to reduce or mitigate potential risk, as designed.

Inspections include checks of critical safety controls for high-risk operations such as contractor maintenance, machinery use, maintenance and repair, dock and yard safety, and powered industrial truck operations. In 2022, we conducted over 5.5 million inspections globally, up from 2.5 million in 2020.

Auditing verifies our compliance with national and international regulations and standards in over 150 jurisdictions globally. We conduct audits for areas such as occupational health, safety management, and facility and technical safety. Findings are tracked by our management system and used to identify root causes, improve compliance, and update internal standards and procedures.

# Engaging Employees on Safety

In 2022, we improved our employee-led safety observation program to make it easier for employees to share suggestions and concerns. As well as representing another leading indicator against which to track progress, the observation program helps facilitate timely, meaningful conversations on safety topics, helping leadership engage with the issues that are most important to Amazon employees. We are encouraged by the preliminary results we are seeing and the potential reduction in lagging indicators as a result of this program.

As well as providing effective communication routes, we seek to enhance understanding through safety trainings that help people take ownership of their own safety. Employees receive critical safety information on their first day of employment, followed by job- and process-path-specific training. During 2022, mental health awareness training was delivered to thousands of managers, with guidance on what to do if mental health concerns arise at work. We also enhanced our worldwide Emergency Response Preparedness training with realistic emergency scenarios. This was further strengthened with an on-site tour to highlight visible cues and provide clear instruction on how to handle shelter or evacuation events.

# Looking Forward

We continue to invest in safety-related projects across Amazon and will invest approximately $550 million in 2023. These projects include capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions that aim to reduce and eliminate risks. We are constantly striving to improve safety for our employees, partners, and communities every day. We know there is more work to do on our journey to become the safest employer across the industries within which we operate. Our commitment to safety has never been stronger—and it will only continue to grow.

# Our Safety Leadership Index

In 2018, we created the Safety Leadership Index (SLI) to measure employee and leader perceptions of safety. The index helps us get ahead of safety risks by gathering feedback through monthly questions, delivered via employees’ scanners and computers. Questions cover topics such as sentiment around leaders’ safety commitment, safety awareness, safety structures, safety involvement, and safety accountability. Feedback is anonymous, confidential, and intended to drive improvement.

In 2022, we engaged over 1.4 million Operations employees through the SLI across more than 3,300 sites in 34 countries.

Did You Know? We encourage anyone interested in seeing our fulfillment facilities to sign up for one of our Amazon Tours, either virtually or in person. More than 1 million people experienced our tours in 2021 and 2022.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Creating Inclusive Experiences

We set three priorities in 2022:

# Our Approach

Our vision is to create inclusive experiences everywhere. Amazon has changed the world through its focus on the customer—and we are approaching DEI and accessibility the same way. Our strategy focuses on using technology wherever possible to create inclusive experiences for employees, customers, and communities around the world.

- Employee experience: Guided by Amazon’s Leadership Principles, we are committed to a culture that creates a safer, more productive, more diverse, and more just work environment. As a part of this, we are building equitable and inclusive experiences for our people, and into our products, processes, and programs.
- Advance DEI through technology: We see an opportunity to address the needs of the future by taking an approach that blends human judgment and artificial intelligence. While it’s still early, we are already seeing that technology helps us inspect and remove potential bias from our people processes and improve human decision-making. This will help us accelerate our progress at scale across every aspect of the workplace.
- Community experience: With our size, speed, and innovative culture, we take bold, deliberate action to drive change on a global scale. Through our inclusive products, services, and touch points in neighborhoods around the world, Amazon aims to be a leader in using science and data to help achieve a more equitable society for the future.
- Customer experience: We work backward from our customers in everything we do. From deliveries at the front door to satellites in space, we are focused on creating accessible solutions that make life easier for people of all backgrounds.

# Our Progress

Amazon has more than 1.5 million employees from varying backgrounds who are dedicated to inventing and delivering for customers around the world. Through internal programs, we are helping employees become better allies, enhancing the experiences of employees and customers, and providing hiring and upskilling opportunities.

# Awards and Recognition

We are honored to have been recognized by various organizations as a great place to work throughout 2022. We know there’s always more to do, but here’s some of the recognition we’ve received as a top employer:

- #1 LinkedIn’s Most Desired Place to Work in the U.S.

Numerous STEM-focused employee communities exist within Amazon and AWS, including Women in Technology, Women in Engineering, Women in AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning), Women in Big Data, and She Builds. The AWS GetIT program encourages young students, especially girls, to pursue careers in technology.

# LGBTQIA+

Whether by sponsoring Pride celebrations around the world or creating new opportunities for LGBTQIA+ entrepreneurs, Amazon is committed to supporting our LGBTQIA+ employees, customers, and communities across the globe. We proudly seek to create inclusive experiences everywhere and in 2022, we:

- Launched Amazon’s first Global LGBTQIA+ Office to advance LGBTQIA+ equity companywide and hired our first Head of LGBTQIA+ Strategy and Programs.
- Created meaningful partnerships with key community groups that lead the way on LGBTQIA+ equity globally, including but not limited to the National Center for Transgender Equality, Rainbow Railroad, Lesbians Who Tech & Allies, and the Point Foundation—through which we sponsored scholarships for LGBTQIA+ students of color as part of the largest LGBTQIA+ scholarship fund in the world.
- Expanded our global support of LGBTQIA+ employees by launching dozens of new chapters of Glamazon, Amazon’s LGBTQIA+ employee affinity group, in China, India, South Africa, and more.
- Earned a Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion designation for the fifth year in a row after getting a perfect score on the Disability Equality Index.

# Military Spouses and Veterans

We recognize the diverse backgrounds and experiences that veterans and military spouses bring to Amazon and how they strengthen the workforce. We proudly employ veterans and military spouses across multiple businesses, including Operations, Sustainability, Alexa, and AWS. In 2022, we:

- Trained military members, veterans, and their spouses for in-demand technical roles at Amazon through company-funded programs like the Amazon Technical Apprenticeship and Career Choice, and continued to make progress on our pledge to hire 100,000 U.S. veterans and military spouses by 2024. In 2022, we hired 30,400 military veterans and 9,600 military spouses.
- Installed sign language video stations in operations centers. The stations feature a rotating series of videos about sign language topics and words, improving communications with colleagues who are deaf or hard of hearing. Since the program launched, we have installed stations across eight countries, with plans to expand to additional countries in the future.
- Donated through the Urgent Need Program in locations in Washington state, Texas, and Washington, D.C., and assisted in reducing veteran suicide by coordinating the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs $20M Mission Daybreak suicide prevention grand challenge, as well as providing support to finalists through an accelerator course and technical mentorship.
- Leveraged Amazon’s resources to support veteran service organizations globally by growing our partnership with the Royal British Legion and advancing initiatives like Program Honor, established by Amazon Global Military Affairs.

We also count employees as they currently identify, both for race and ethnicity and for gender. Therefore, when an employee updates their identification, Amazon counts that employee according to their new identification at all times in their career at Amazon, which may change historic data and reporting.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Increasing Supplier Diversity

# Our Approach

In 2022, we focused on building and strengthening our SDI processes, technologies, and partnerships. Our vision is to execute a world-class global SDI strategy that enables long-term economic sustainability in the communities in which we operate. To achieve this, we are prioritizing three actions:

- Driving impact globally by scaling existing diverse businesses and onboarding new ones
- Partnering with global diversity advocacy organizations to engage more diverse suppliers in the sourcing process
- Standardizing SDI operating procedures across the company and ensuring oversight

Strategic partnerships help us grow and nurture supplier relationships. By the end of 2022, Amazon held corporate membership with each of the major U.S. diversity advocacy organizations. Additionally, we were invited to join WBENC’s Board of Directors, strengthening our partnership and creating more opportunities for women-owned businesses to work with Amazon. We also joined two global supplier diversity agencies—WEConnect International, the global certification body for women-owned businesses, and the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council.

The key to increasing sourcing with certified diverse-owned businesses is understanding current supply chain diversity. Starting in 2022, we initiated reviews of our existing U.S. supply base and sourcing practices. Through this foundational work, we identified that Amazon spent $3.3 billion with 375 certified U.S. Tier 1 diverse suppliers in 2022. We will continue to track and measure our progress in this area, leveraging a renewed, companywide SDI focus and a commitment to further action.

# Driving Impact with Diverse Businesses Globally

Through our SDI approach, we seek to include more diverse-owned and small businesses in our procurement processes. In 2022, we focused on increasing the diversity of certified U.S. Tier 1 suppliers—companies we contract with to provide goods and services, such as marketing, construction, and professional services to operate our businesses.

In addition to increasing the number of U.S. certified diverse suppliers and their associated spend, we encourage our Tier 1 suppliers to include diverse suppliers in their own sourcing activities. During 2022, 141 of Amazon’s Tier 1 suppliers reported spending $1.56 billion with Tier 2 diverse suppliers.

# Looking Forward

Amazon’s supplier diversity program is guided by our ambition to extend procurement opportunities to diverse businesses, with the goal of driving supply chain innovation and offering customers a broader range of products and services. In 2023, we are expanding our program globally, aiming to generate wider economic impact through our suppliers.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Supporting Global Communities

Amazon’s culture is built around finding effective solutions to difficult problems; this enables us to take a more hands-on approach to community support wherever we operate. We are tackling critical issues to create lasting, positive impact, working with local organizations on tailored programs that address areas like:

- Creating and preserving affordable housing
- Improving access to food and basic needs
- Community education and skills training
- Disaster relief and response
- Product donations

We also aim to create employment opportunities where we operate to help drive economic growth and empowerment.

# Our Approach

# Our Progress

# Creating and Preserving Affordable Housing

Through the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, we’ve pledged $2 billion to preserve and create more than 20,000 affordable homes in three communities in which we have a high concentration of employees: Washington state’s Puget Sound region; Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia; and Nashville, Tennessee. We partner with agencies to make housing available where it’s needed most, including near transit and in historically diverse, underserved communities. As of the end of 2022, we had committed over $1.6 billion to build homes that will support approximately 18,000 people.

In 2022 alone, we made significant progress, with several new commitments, including:

- $445.6 million for 3,868 homes in Arlington, Washington, D.C., and Maryland
- $249.2 million for 3,078 homes in the Puget Sound region
- $97.4 million for 1,107 homes in Nashville

Addressing the housing crisis requires collective effort, and we are focusing on creating equal access to development opportunities. Through the Amazon Housing Equity Fund, we launched a $21 million, two-year accelerator in 2021 to help minority-led real estate developers overcome entry barriers to the affordable housing development industry.

Through the accelerator program, participants receive in-person instruction on real estate fundamentals, affordable housing trends, public policy, and financing practices. They also gain access to expert business advisors, professional networking opportunities, and capital for pre-development expenses. In 2022, 17 minority-led developers were supported; collectively, minority-led developers were responsible for 40% of the 2022 projects we committed to through the Housing Equity Fund.

# Improving Access to Food and Health Care

Everyone should have access to the food and resources they need to live. However, today, 34 million people in the U.S. struggle with food insecurity. We are focusing on scalable solutions that help us meet the basic needs of families in underserved communities.

In 2021, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched a three-year program to enhance health outcomes for underserved and historically marginalized communities. By 2024, the AWS Health Equity Initiative plans to distribute $40 million in cloud computing credits and technical expertise to organizations promoting equitable health care access, addressing social determinants of health, and leveraging data to develop inclusive care systems.

# Increasing Food Security

We strive to bring healthy, affordable food to customers and, in 2019, became one of the first retailers to accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) payments for online transactions. SNAP is a federal program that provides food-purchasing assistance to low- and no-income people. Through it, customers can purchase fresh, healthy foods from Amazon, Amazon Fresh, and Whole Foods Market, both online and in-store.

Amazon’s online delivery coverage includes 49 states plus the District of Columbia. In November 2022, we launched a pilot in Washington state that enables SNAP EBT customers to earn and redeem incentives for purchasing more fresh fruits and vegetables through Amazon Fresh online.

# Supporting Global Communities

# Community Education and Skills Training

We have invested in various programs for children, students, and adults alike to develop valuable science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills. For example, in 2021, we partnered with China’s YouChange Foundation to launch Coding for the Future; in 2022, 58 teachers across four provinces received training through the program to help 3,500 children learn the basics of coding.

# AWS Education and Skills Training Resources

In 2022, AWS InCommunities launched 10 Think Big Spaces—bringing the total to more than 60 globally—so more students can explore STEM and the arts outside the classroom. They also piloted a new program, AWS CloudRoom, in 65 schools globally, reaching 4,800 students. Additionally, AWS InCommunities supported 10 Girls’ Tech Day events globally, reaching over 7,300 girls and young women.

# Amazon Future Engineer

We provide childhood-to-career computer science (CS) education through Amazon Future Engineer, focusing on students from underserved and historically marginalized communities. Throughout 2022, 700 schools participated in Amazon Future Engineer education, while over 5,500 teachers received virtual resources and training. Notably, we donated $1 million through the program to CodeVA to expand access to CS education in Virginia and to help schools implement state-mandated CS lessons.

# Did You Know?

Amazon is making cybersecurity awareness training available—for free—to other companies and individuals.

# Supporting Those Impacted by the War in Ukraine

Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, we have worked to deliver timely and appropriate relief. Just 10 days after Russia invaded, we built aid hubs in Slovakia and Poland, and we have donated aid items such as medical supplies and critical relief products since the start of the conflict. We also collaborated with the Ukrainian government to keep critical services operational.

# Disaster Relief and Response

We leverage our technology and logistics to provide fast, effective aid following natural disasters. In 2021, Disaster Relief by Amazon developed a global disaster relief hub to facilitate this. The special fulfillment center in Atlanta stores 1.2 million items, including shelter and repair materials, hygiene supplies, medical equipment, and basic household items.

In September 2022, when Hurricane Ian hit Florida, we quickly activated the hub to prepare urgent relief supplies. We sent over 900,000 bottles of water to Florida and other impacted states, strategically positioning delivery trucks to make sure we got supplies to those who needed them, when they needed them.

# 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report

# Supporting Global Communities

Alongside Atlanta, we now have a global network of disaster relief hubs in the U.S., Europe, and Australia, which, collectively, have donated 22 million items as of the end of 2022. When an earthquake hit Luding County in Sichuan, China, we donated 2,800 kits with clothes, blankets, disinfectant wipes, masks, and flashlights. Additionally, in India, we responded to 55 requests for disaster relief support, working with 25 nonprofits to distribute relief kits to support 27,100 households.

To further support global disaster responses, our AWS Disaster Preparedness and Response team delivers cloud technology to relief organizations. These advanced computing capabilities aid recovery by accelerating damage assessments and restoring internet connectivity. Following Hurricane Ian in 2022, the team deployed volunteers and AWS technology alongside relief organization Help.NGO to help establish internet connectivity for community centers. During the year, the team also conducted multiple field testing exercises to refine cloud-based tools to help first responders and humanitarian agencies more effectively respond to emergencies.

# Product Donations

Just because an item is returned to one of our facilities doesn’t mean it’s at the end of its useful life. Together with Good360, we are donating goods to people across the U.S. and Canada. Amazon facilitated the donation of over 15 million products to charities in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2022, including Age UK, Barnardo’s, British Heart Foundation, and Cancer Research UK.

We also announced the expansion of the Big House project in Scotland, created in partnership with local charities, businesses, and former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Formally launched in 2022, the project distributed 400,000 essential items in partnership with 600 partner organizations to thousands of Scottish families in its first year.

# Whole Kids Foundation

Whole Kids Foundation helps children eat better, delivering education grants, supporting schools to transform their food options, and inspiring families to improve children’s nutrition and wellness. In 2022, it funded:

|506|Edible educational gardens grants|
|---|---|
|142|Grants for salad bars in U.S. schools|
|129|Food Access grants for community-led nonprofits working to improve local food systems and healthy food access in Newark, New Jersey.|

# Whole Cities Foundation

Whole Cities Foundation works to improve community health through partnerships, education, and broader access to nutritious food. In 2022, the foundation supported 57 Community First grants designed to support nonprofits focused on long-term fresh, healthy food access and nutrition education that are engaged with Whole Foods Market team members.

# Local Producer Loan Program

Whole Foods Market also runs a Local Producer Loan Program to support small, local, and independent food producers across the U.S. and Canada with business expansion loans. Since 2006, the program has delivered more than 375 loans—totaling nearly $28 million in capital—to support growth potential. In 2022 alone, Whole Foods Market funded six loans totaling $1.8 million.

# Employee Volunteer Efforts

In 2022, we launched our Global Month of Volunteering and engaged employees to make a positive impact in their communities. Volunteer activities included recovering surplus food to distribute to nonprofits, cleaning parks and schools in underserved neighborhoods, and prepping backpacks with school supplies. More than 38,000 employees from over 50 countries participated in this inaugural campaign.

# Whole Planet Foundation

Whole Planet Foundation looks to empower the world’s poorest people with microcredit loans to create or expand home-based businesses. In 2022, the foundation and donors granted over $7.85 million to microfinance partners across 37 countries to create 33,555 microloans for the world’s most vulnerable entrepreneurs.

Xocolatl Bakery is one of many local companies in Eastern Oregon that benefited from AWS’ investment in the region.

# Supporting Global Communities

# Enhancing UK Biodiversity

In October 2022, Amazon committed £2.8 million to two UK programs: The Woodland Trust’s Emergency Tree Fund and the Rewild London Fund led by the Mayor of London. Both initiatives aim to enhance biodiversity and improve access to nature through tree-planting, while creating jobs and volunteering opportunities. Together, the programs will plant over 450,000 trees and support 22 critical London rewilding projects.

# Planting Trees in Italy

In Milan, Italy, as part of our wider €2 million pledge to support the Parco Italia reforestation program, in 2022 we helped plant over 6,000 trees through the Forestami project, contributing to Parco Italia’s long-term goal of planting over 22 million trees.

# Looking Forward

As we move forward, we will continue supporting communities in which we operate, focusing on the areas where we can have the most impact—housing equity, food and basic needs, health equity, education, disaster relief, and product donations. We will also continue delivering support in the areas of nutrition and environmental protection, with strategic investments through our Whole Foods Market foundations and Right Now Climate Fund.

# Restoring Ecosystems in France

In France, we pledged €3 million over three years to CDC Biodiversité’s Fonds Nature 2050 program to preserve and restore biodiversity, while mitigating climate change impacts and improving ecosystem resilience. Amazon will fund projects that restore approximately 600,000 square meters of habitat.

# Restoring Coastal Habitats in the U.S.

Amazon has engaged with environmental partners to foster marine biodiversity initiatives for the benefit of coastal communities in the U.S. in which we operate. Since 2021, we have supported three initiatives, including funding the Puget Sound Restoration Fund to restore Olympia oyster habitats near Port of Seattle, launching a giant kelp reforestation pilot with the Bay Foundation near the Port of Los Angeles, and funding the restoration of a living shoreline in partnership with the Port of Virginia, set to begin construction in 2023.

Our people are committed to giving back to their communities, supporting relevant causes to help address local needs.

As we examined our work toward The Climate Pledge, we realized that it no longer made sense to have a separate and more narrow Shipment Zero goal that applied to only one part of our business, so we’ve decided to eliminate it. We set Shipment Zero as a goal before we announced our commitment to The Climate Pledge, which is a more comprehensive effort to drive innovation and decarbonization efforts across our entire business. We remain focused on The Climate Pledge and our goal to reach net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040—this includes working toward powering our operations with 100% renewable energy, transforming and decarbonizing our transportation network with electric vehicles and alternative fuels, using more sustainable building materials, and reducing packaging waste, among other areas.

15. As detailed in our Renewable Energy Methodology, to calculate the percentage of renewable energy powering Amazon’s operations, we evaluate both the amount of renewable energy from Amazon’s projects and the renewable energy in the grid. This total renewable energy is then compared to Amazon’s total energy use.
16. This metric is inclusive of shipments from the Amazon fulfillment network fulfilled through Amazon-owned and -operated fulfillment centers across the U.S., Canada, Japan, India, Europe, and certain other geographies. Amazon Grocery Logistics shipments, such as Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market, are also included. We calculate the weight of single-use plastic by multiplying total delivery shipments by the weight of the particular plastic packaging used. In the cases where outbound shipment count is not available, we look at materials purchased, such as dunnage and prep, to estimate the weight of single-use plastic. This metric excludes third-party packaging.
17. In the U.S., an LTI is work-related and results in one or more days away from work, excluding the date of the injury and including the days the employee was scheduled to work, weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off. Outside the U.S., lost time varies by country, and we follow local laws and record-keeping requirements.
18. While we measure safety across Amazon, performance rates reported here are based on data for our global operations—fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery stations, and Amazon-branded physical stores. This is where approximately two-thirds of our employees work and where we see most incidents. For the purposes of this report, we removed performance data from corporate offices, call centers, and AWS.
19. Goal scope covers food that is considered inventory. It is measured with a food waste intensity metric that calculates the amount of food waste generated as a percentage of total food handled within Amazon.
20. Amazon Warehouse is an online marketplace where customers can purchase quality used, pre-owned, or open-box products with all the benefits of Amazon fulfillment, customer service, and returns rights.
21. UN-Water.
22. The WNI defines “water neutral” as the amount of water conserved being equal to the quantity of water consumed, with a score of 1.
23. This scope is limited to operational processes and Amazon-owned and -leased sites. Scope includes fulfillment centers, sort centers, Global Specialty Fulfillment, and Amazon Logistics, and excludes AWS buildings.
24. Tier 2 is the term we use to measure the economic impact generated for diverse suppliers throughout our supply chain. Tier 2 is the spend Amazon’s suppliers reported purchasing from diverse businesses.
25. Diverse-owned businesses are those whose majority owners (51% or more) are ethnic minorities, women, individuals living with disabilities, veterans, or those who identify as LGBTQIA+.
26. Feeding America.
27. Transforming degraded land back into its natural state through reintroducing plants and animals.
