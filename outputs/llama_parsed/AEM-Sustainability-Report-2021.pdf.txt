# FORE WORD

# Board Statement

The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") is pleased to present our "Sustainability Report" for FY2021, which is our continued commitment to share our sustainability journey with all our stakeholders transparently and credibly.

AEM is committed to sustainability reporting. As we continue to grow our operations, we are conscious of our business’ impact on the community and environment, and how sustainability issues may affect our strategy and operations. The Board and the management pledge to incorporate sustainable practices into our processes and consider sustainability issues such as environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors as part of our Group’s strategic formulation. To do so, we determine the material ESG factors and we will continue to manage and monitor our efforts in addressing these material factors.

AEM acquired CEI Limited ("CEI") in 1H2021. CEI, having regional footprint and expertise in its field, will strengthen AEM’s resilience and allow us to be even more responsive to the needs of our global customer base. The acquisition would help to solidify our leadership position in serving semiconductor and electronics companies in the advanced computing, 5G, and artificial intelligence space.

Following the acquisition of CEI, there are changes in the trends from FY2020 to FY2021 for certain material ESG factors considered.

This Report outlines our short-term, long-term, and perpetual targets1 concerning the material ESG factors linked to our business strategy and financial performance. We want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the ongoing support from our stakeholders and seek their support in our goal of sustainable growth and development.

1 In our business planning, we consider our perpetual targets as part of AEM’s ongoing initiatives to maintain operational excellence in sustainability.

# Sustainable Supplier Management (GRI 308-1, 414-1)

AEM collaborates and regularly engages with our suppliers at all stages of our purchasing process. We select our suppliers based on their track record and assess their ability to complement our commitment to deliver high-quality products and services before inclusion as an approved vendor. Our assessments and reviews on our suppliers’ performance include labour, environmental, health, safety, and ethical standards and practices to ensure their alignment with AEM’s requirements.

AEM also has an internal screening process where suppliers are screened for negative environmental and social impacts resulting from their business operations. This includes, amongst others, pollution (land, air, water, and noise), biodiversity loss, global warming, land degradation, deforestation, incidents of child labour, violation involving rights of indigenous people, breaches of customer privacy, and non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic area. In FY2021, AEM onboarded a total of 238 new suppliers. None of these new suppliers was identified to have negative environmental or social impacts.

# Supplier Environmental Assessment (GRI 308-1)

We follow a supplier screening guide to ensure that all of our key existing suppliers were screened using environmental criteria. Our assessment demonstrated that all our key existing suppliers were either compliant with industry standards such as the ISO14001 or have published their environmental policy and/or sustainability report that is compliant with local laws.

# Supplier Social Assessment (GRI 414-1)

Similarly, we follow a supplier screening guide to ensure that all 238 new suppliers were screened using social criteria. All of our key suppliers are compliant with industry standards and in line with AEM requirements.

# Energy (GRI 302-1, 302-3, 302-4)

Energy is important to AEM as it is critical to our business activities. While energy-intensive equipment may result in higher utility costs, business operations would be disrupted without them. Therefore, it is important that we manage our electricity and energy consumption responsibly to help protect the environment in which the AEM entities operate.

Diesel is used primarily by the commercial vehicles in CEI which the Group acquired in 1H2021. In FY2021, AEM started and will continue to track its diesel consumption. The total diesel consumption was 0.5% of the total energy consumption in FY2021.

Further, our total energy consumption increased as a result of increased production in FY2021 and with the addition of CEI. Nevertheless, AEM endeavours to reduce energy consumption in our business activities through efficient operations and minimisation of wastage. On this front, we have taken steps to reduce our energy consumption and wastage to contribute to environmental sustainability efforts.

For instance, we have continuous energy-saving initiatives which include:

- the replacement of fluorescent lighting with LED energy-saving lighting,
- the programming of air-conditioner and lights to switch off automatically after office hours,
- the replacement of air-conditioning ducting from cassette to inverter type,
- the replacement of old inefficient equipment with energy-efficient ones, and
- introducing usage discipline through posters and briefings to promote awareness of electricity conservation among our employees.

24 Sustainability Report 2021 www.aem.com.sg

# A E M H o l d i n g s L td .

In addition to our conscious management of electricity and energy consumption, in FY2021, AEM purchased 6,000 Renewable Energy Certificates to offset electricity consumed from conventional sources. This is equivalent to about 49% of our total FY2021 electricity consumption using conventional sources.

Through this initiative, besides being committed to adopting renewable energy as an integral part of our energy portfolio, we hope that this would encourage more future investments in renewable energy projects globally.

# Emissions

# (GRI 305-1, GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4)

As we strive to reduce our emission footprint, AEM takes into consideration our Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emission levels in every stage of our manufacturing process. We understand the manufacturing operations of AEM entail significant energy requirements, therefore, the efficient use of energy is essential to reducing potential GHG emissions for AEM.

The following table shows the energy emission intensity ratio for AEM.

|Year|Total direct CO2 or Carbon Equivalent Emissions (metric tons)|Total indirect CO2 or Carbon Equivalent Emissions (metric tons)|Revenue (in S$M)|Emission Intensity Ratio (MT/S$’000)|

# Waste Management

# (GRI 306-1, 306-2, 306-3)

AEM is conscious of the waste we generate. The waste we have generated is input from our suppliers and those that evolved from our operations and manufacturing processes.

# Waste Generated

# Input (from Suppliers)

- Paper
- Carton boxes
- Chemical substances (Loctite, oil, etc.)

There are three main categories of waste at AEM, hazardous waste (which includes chemical waste), recycled waste (which includes leftover metals, paper and plastic), and general waste. About 63% of the waste we generated were general waste.

# Total weight of waste generated (in metric tons)

|Activities|22.5|

|• Carton boxes| |
|• Used chemicals (Loctite, oil, coolant, etc.)|Hazardous waste|
|• Soldering waste| |
|• Solder dross|Recycled waste|
|• Metal leftover|General waste|

Initiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainable waste management play a vital role in fulfilling Singapore’s ambition of becoming a Zero Waste Nation. In support of Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, we have accelerated our efforts to reduce waste by:

- converting several of our internal processes from paper-based to electronic records;
- engaging a third-party recycler to recycle waste generated from our manufacturing process and operations (e.g. metal leftovers generated from our manufacturing process); and
- reusing carton boxes and plastic pallets.

These efforts have yielded results and we will continue to promote waste reduction efforts.

# (GRI 303-5)

# (GRI 307-1)

AEM has complied with environmental protection and management regulations. We proactively review our manufacturing processes to reduce pollution, waste, hazardous substances, and noise. Our employees are educated and trained on our environment control plan based on specific work instructions and must maintain records for this purpose. Material suppliers are also required to meet our Environmental Management System requirements for the materials and services they supply.

|Total water consumption from all areas (m3)|FY2019|FY2020|FY2021|

|Water consumed per monetary unit of sales (m3/S$'000)|0.044|0.031|0.088|

*Note: Significant increase in water consumption in FY2021 due to inclusion of consumption by CEI, which the Group acquired in 1H2021.

AEM carefully monitors and manages our water consumption levels. In line with the national initiatives and strategies to use water wisely, we continue to adopt water reduction and conservation efforts to do our part as responsible stewards of the nation’s water supply. The measures we have taken include:

- introducing usage discipline at all our operating and manufacturing sites to promote water conservation awareness among employees via education posters and briefings, and
- the replacement of conventional tap to motion-sensor taps and spring taps to improve water efficiency.

Every year, we engage qualified vendors to perform audits and tests. AEM complies with all National Environment Agency’s ("NEA") environmental laws and regulations. There have been no fines or non-compliance by AEM over the past decade, and we aim to maintain this record of accomplishment in the next 10 years.

# Solidifying Relationships with Our Stakeholders

As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, AEM is committed to evolving our HR practices to stay relevant and create the best possible environment for our workforce.

We have adapted recent HR technologies to our advantage to reinforce workforce abilities, ensure data security, improve candidate and employee experiences, and more.

# New employees hired by gender

Talent plays a key role in ensuring our Company’s success. Aside from efforts to maintain a low turnover rate, we continued to attract new talent globally. AEM practices non-discrimination and equal opportunities. Our new hires are employed based on merits and experiences, and we seek to keep our turnover rates low by promoting employees’ loyalty through benefits, safety, and welfare. As of 31 December 2021, AEM’s workforce consists of 1,496 employees, an increase of 851 employees compared to the previous year due mainly to the acquisition of CEI.

Due to the pandemic lockdowns, many foreign workers have resigned to return to their home countries. Despite the unfavorable environment to hire new foreign workers due to the travel restrictions, AEM is pleased to share that we were able to achieve 398 new hires, more than double the number of new hires in FY2020.

The ratio of male to female new hires has been around 3:1 in FY2019 and FY2020. In FY2021, the ratio has rebalanced to 2:1. This change is due to higher female new hires in Vietnam and Indonesia.

AEM aims to further improve the gender ratio by hiring more females in the engineering field and providing equal opportunities for all genders, particularly in regions with low female representation.

The total compensation of an employee is determined based on individual expertise, job responsibility, performance, contributions to long-term goals, and the Company's operations and profitability.

AEM believes in providing a strong variable component in employee remuneration. We are also expanding our performance share awards to incentivise more employees.

# Competitive Benefits and Employee Care

In FY2021, AEM reviewed and enhanced employee benefits. We were mindful of the need to have sufficient life and medical insurance cover for all our employees, and added Group Term Life insurance for all our employees. With the increasing medical costs, we have increased the medical coverage for all our employees to give them peace of mind against substantial medical bills in the event of a major illness. We also ensured our employees have sufficient vacation leave to rest and spend time with their families by increasing the leave entitlement for our direct, indirect, and managerial staff.

Our foreign workers have not traveled home to visit their family and friends over the last two years because of the pandemic. To assist them, AEM helped by covering the quarantine hotel cost when they return from their home leave.

# Employee Wellbeing

# Occupational Health and Safety

(GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-4, 403-6, 403-9, 403-10)

Monitoring work-related hazards and risks on a routine basis is one of AEM’s top priorities to ensure that our employees feel safe and competent in executing their responsibilities.

Guided by the hierarchy of controls, we have applied these relevant processes, including:

- The 5x5 risk assessment matrix per Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower (“MOM”) Code of Practice
- Conducted internal risk assessment training for AEM staff
- Developed a safety manual in line with the Singapore standard code of practice for the safety management system
- Periodic review of risk assessment processes by the respective managers to evaluate AEM’s occupational health and safety management practices
- Formal Workplace Safety and Health (“WSH”) Group reconvenes monthly to address any matters on workers’ participation and communication

In FY2021, we started tracking work-related hazards that could potentially cause injury or ill health. We are pleased that with these measures in place, we maintained our record of having reported zero (0) cases of recordable work-related injuries or ill health, zero (0) cases of high-consequence work-related injuries, zero (0) cases of fatalities resulting from a work-related injury or ill health, for all employees and workers.

AEM acknowledges that a good work-life balance is key to having good mental health and promoting staff wellbeing and satisfaction. Henceforth, we also provide team-building activities – most of it virtually - to keep our employees engaged and de-stressed. We recognised that the prolonged pandemic is causing much mental stress and in the coming year, we are introducing an Employee Assistance Programme that comes with proactive recreational and health-promoting activities as well as life coaching to individuals. By doing so, we hope to create a positive and inclusive work culture, which in turn would strengthen our employees’ positivity and commitment to the Company.

Building on our existing efforts to observe occupational health and safety measures at AEM, a routine safety orientation and toolbox briefing is conducted. The respective supervisors can monitor all feedback closely and take the necessary corrective measures accordingly. Employees are encouraged to report any work-related hazards and hazardous situations directly to their superiors and/or safety committee members and to submit work-related hazards through the suggestion box.

AEM believes that our greatest assets are our people and that our staff’s technological and engineering skills and knowledge are the core of our success. Therefore, we invest in training, learning initiatives, and development programmes to expand our staff competencies.

We have established guidelines for training identification, monitoring, and review. Besides technical skills, we also organise business, leadership, train-the-trainer, finance, operational management, and enterprise resource planning training for our management and staff.

Our commitment is to help employees develop professionally and personally to advance their careers in AEM. As we navigate our way through changes in modes of working due to COVID-19, we have prepared a wide range of training programmes that employees can attend physically and remotely.

For example, we launched the Learning Management System (“LMS”) in June 2021. Employees are encouraged to take ownership of their professional development as they can enrol themselves for e-learning courses and on-site classroom training, and track and manage their training records. Two of our employees have also been awarded the Continuing Education Sponsorship, in support of their pursuit of further studies. As such, each employee has received an average of 18.4 training hours in FY2021 compared to 7.8 training hours in FY2020.

A significant achievement in FY2021 is that the training hours per female employee increased from 7.1 hours to 25.0 hours, 70% higher than the training hours per male employee. The training hours per direct employee also increased significantly from 12.7 hours in FY2020 to 34.4 hours in FY2021.
