# Message from Chairman and Group CEO

The year 2020 was like no other – COVID-19 has upended the way we live and work, impacted how enterprises operate and accelerated digital adoption across the community. Against this unprecedented backdrop, the Group was put in the hot seat, as virtually every aspect of human interaction moved online amid lockdowns and social distancing, behoving us to connect people to work, school, family and healthcare without a hitch.

We believe we rose to the challenge and fulfilled the requirements of all our stakeholders in successfully ensuring business continuity while doubling down on efforts to foster digital inclusion for the broader community. Even as the pandemic has emphasised the essential nature of the connectivity that we provide, we are actively investing in next generation 5G technology to forge ahead and enable a faster digital transformation for all our stakeholders.

In this seventh Singtel Group Sustainability Report 2021, we highlight some of the steps that we have taken to further enhance financial, organisational, social and natural resilience. This enables us to not only deliver sustainable business performance, but also continue to uplift lives and communities through our initiatives, and to keep to our climate change commitments. The report has been endorsed by the Singtel Board and Management and highlights our plans, achievements and progress, and our new five-year sustainability targets to 2025.

# CHARTING OUR JOURNEY TO 2025

In 2020, we embarked on a new materiality assessment and stakeholder engagement exercise, to ensure that our four strategic sustainability pillars continue to be relevant for our internal and external stakeholders. Some of the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) topics in our last exercise in 2017 have changed in priority and significance, partly due to the pandemic and changes in the environmental and social climate. We have refreshed our commitments in the key pillars of sustainable value creation, environment, people and community. These will guide our decisions and actions over the next few years.

Long-term incentive plans in addition to the existing annual ESG-related targets in our Management Committee members’ short-term incentive plans. This will help drive more accountability from management and employees to advance our goal of sustainable growth. We also executed our first S$750 million sustainability-linked loan recently, which is tied to a subset of our ESG KPIs.

# CREATING SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR ALL

The focus of our sustainability strategy has always been to create value for all stakeholders, from our customers, shareholders and employees to the broader community. We aim to integrate the core ESG priorities within our businesses with a strong focus on innovation, digital enablement and good supply chain governance. It is also how we believe we can strengthen financial resilience for the business in the long term.

In Australia, we published our first Modern Slavery and Human Rights statement in end-2020 and updated our Supplier Code of Conduct for compliance. We trained our employees on our approach to these topics, and how to reduce related risks in our supply chain.

# MAKING CLIMATE-CONSCIOUS BUSINESS DECISIONS

The last year has highlighted the connections between the pandemic and climate change. The global lockdown and the slowdown across economies have resulted in improved air quality and a temporary decrease in carbon emissions. To ensure that these positive climate shifts continue after the pandemic, organisations need to take conscious climate action and have deliverables embedded into their recovery plans.

Singapore’s current focus on sustainability validates our early move in 2017 to establish SBTi-approved 2030 carbon reduction targets and to reach net zero by 2050. To that end, we are developing a decarbonisation roadmap including renewable energy adoption in our Singapore and Australian operations, adding to our ongoing initiatives such as converting to energy efficient mobile base stations.

During the year, we also formalised a set of ESG-related targets for the Singtel Group Top Management’s. Last year, Australia suffered bushfires which was followed by floods, highlighting extreme weather patterns in part.

# About this Report

# Contents

# Our Sustainability Approach

Accelerated by climate change. As part of our ongoing strategy to build natural resilience, and in preparation for greater disclosure aligned to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, we have completed a detailed pilot study in northern New South Wales to understand our physical and transitional risks from different climate change scenarios. We also undertook an extensive bushfire prediction and adaptation exercise with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). These exercises revealed valuable insights to our climate adaptation strategy outlined in this report. In the coming year, we will replicate these across our entire Australia and Singapore operations.

# DIGITISING OUR WAY FORWARD

The pandemic has accelerated not just the rate of digital adoption but also ignited conversation on how certain vulnerable groups in society, like seniors, have fallen through the gaps as they have little or no digital access. Without devices to connect and transact, many seniors have been left feeling isolated from family and friends and find it challenging to go about their daily lives.

Under Singtel’s digital enablement strategy, we launched the Singtel Digital Silvers programme in Singapore to help bridge those gaps, empowering seniors with digital skills so they feel less displaced by technology. 88% of them have expressed more confidence in using their mobile phones after attending our sessions.

We have also given SMEs a leg up through our Let’s Get Digital programme, helping SMEs take their business online to get more customers. With SMEs turning to infocomm technology to position themselves for post-COVID recovery and growth, we have also helped by offering tailored cyber security, collaboration and productivity solutions at an 80% subsidy under the government’s Productivity Solutions Grant.

# KEEPING EMPLOYEES SAFE AND ENGAGED

The pandemic has highlighted the importance of organisational resilience. Keeping our employees safe, healthy and fully engaged has been a key priority since the onset of COVID-19. We implemented workforce separation aligned with social distancing and business continuity measures and tightened safety and health protocol across our workplace. Our key frontline employees were also prioritised for vaccination.

Leveraging technology and collaborative digital tools has been key to achieving successful employee engagement during the extended periods of remote working. Regular advisories were sent to keep employees updated and ‘pulse surveys’ conducted to check on their well-being and how they were coping. Training and competency development for employees also continued digitally, with online modules covering topics ranging from personal development to professional and technical courses. We also achieved a record 32% higher learning places compared to last year.

Our efforts to connect with employees are reflected in our annual staff engagement survey which was conducted in November 2020. Staff engagement improved 10% compared to the previous year.

# Community Impact

In Australia, our Donate Your Data programme continues to gain traction – the switch to online and remote learning amid the pandemic has only heightened its relevance. To date, about 15,000 students have benefitted from 25.5 million GB of data generously donated by more than 440,000 Optus customers.

# STAYING THE COURSE

COVID-19 continues to be a challenge that we all have to grapple with in the coming year. At Singtel, we remain optimistic and eager to chart new directions with our updated sustainability framework. We believe that active collaboration among businesses, governments and the non-profit sector will help us all emerge stronger. On behalf of the Singtel Board and Management, we thank you for your support.

# Our Sustainability Approach

The Singtel Group, as Asia’s leading communications technology company aims to create sustainable value not just for our shareholders, but also how we help our employees grow and develop, how we connect and enrich the lives of our customers and community through building trust and innovation, and how we create a positive impact on our environment.

We hope, through this approach, to be recognised globally for our responsible and leading business practices, and loved locally by our customers, communities and the markets we operate in. (UNGC) which Singtel has been a signatory since 2007, our priority 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the global and local initiatives that Singtel Group is committed to.

For example, we are a member of The Valuable 500 and a founding member of the Singapore Business Network on DisAbility (SBNoD) to advance the equitable inclusion of persons with disabilities. We endorsed the TCFD framework in 2017 and GSMA’s global ambition of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 for the telecommunications sector last year.

# Refreshed sustainability framework

We refreshed our sustainability framework during the year to better articulate how we embed sustainability into our business strategies and reflect our latest stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment. This framework comprises four sustainability themes, each a strategic driver with purpose and outcomes.

Besides serving as the compass to guide our actions, the framework seeks to demonstrate how our strategy, governance, programmes and performance lead to long-term business growth and value creation for stakeholders while protecting our environment.

This sustainability framework also supports the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact.

# Renewed focus through stakeholder engagement and materiality review

We engage our internal and external stakeholders through constant dialogue on an extensive range of topics using various platforms and feedback mechanisms. This is on top of our regular interim and formal materiality assessments. With a deep understanding of all our stakeholders – their changing needs and interests as well as emerging concerns – we ensure the relevance of our sustainability strategy and programmes to deliver the intended outcome and impact.

Our third formal stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment was conducted between Q3 FY2020 and Q1 FY2021 across Singapore and Australia.

# Climate Change and Environment

Reduce our carbon, waste and environmental footprint while building resilient networks and communities.

# People and Future of Work

Build a safe, diverse and inclusive workplace while attracting, retaining and investing in our people, equipping them with skills for the future workforce.

# Sustainable Value Creation

Figure 1: Singtel Group’s Sustainability Framework

It aimed to identify and assess the ESG issues, risks and opportunities in areas that matter most to our stakeholders and the Singtel Group.

# Phase 1: Risk sensing

We analysed a wide range of global and industry studies on current and future sustainability trends to help us identify long-term sustainability success factors. This included literature guidance like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the GSMA Sustainability Assessment Framework, the pivotal role of info-communications technology (ICT) in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development, and competitive benchmarking of global telecommunication peers’ sustainability goals and supported SDGs.

# Phase 2: Stakeholder engagement

We obtained a detailed view of the ESG topics our stakeholders expect of the Singtel Group through direct engagement and feedback. We consulted close to 2,500 individuals from ten key stakeholder groups through online surveys and one-on-one interviews. We also engaged new stakeholders – Academia and Bond Investors – due to their expertise in thought leadership and sustainable financing to help shape our sustainability strategy. Both internal and external stakeholders also evaluated our ESG performance and suggested areas of improvement. More details of stakeholder expectations can be found under Stakeholder Engagement on pages 11-12.

# Phase 3: Materiality workshop

The risk sensing and stakeholder engagement identified 19 material topics, which were validated at a materiality workshop first with the sustainability teams at Singtel and Optus to ensure topic relevance and significance, and subsequently with the Singtel Management Committee and Board.

We grouped the 19 topics into four main sustainability themes: Climate Change and Environment, People and Future of Work, Community Impact, and Sustainable Value Creation which form a refreshed sustainability framework for the Singtel Group.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

In addition, we conducted a new round of supply chain sustainability and organisational life cycle assessment to identify direct and indirect environment and social impact as well as risks and opportunities across our business operations and value chain.

The assessment also reviewed the ESG commitment of our top 100 suppliers against our material topics. These suppliers constitute 65% of our procurement spend. More details can be found under supplier sustainability assessment on page 55.

# Phase 4: Material topic prioritisation

The 19 topics were plotted onto a materiality matrix based on the importance to stakeholders and significance to the Singtel Group. This gives us strategic clarity in responding to the opportunities and risks, which we grouped into three clusters:

- Priority: These ten topics of high significance serve to sharpen our sustainability focus and strategies to maintain our market leadership while leveraging our core ICT competence.
- Ongoing importance: These six topics represent our stakeholders’ primary expectation of the Singtel Group as a responsible corporate citizen.
- Monitor and manage: These three topics will be actively monitored and addressed as part of our holistic sustainability approach.

# UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

As a leading communications technology company, we recognise our role and capability in solving the broader environmental and social issues and contribute to the UN SDGs at the national and global level.

With the completion of our materiality review, we also undertook an SDG prioritisation exercise for Singtel Group using a weighted scoring system. We first consolidated relevant UN SDGs linked to six different factors using two lenses of internal perspectives and external alignment.

The three external alignment factors were: (a) the national SDG-related agenda of Singapore and Australia (b) stakeholders’ priority SDGs from our stakeholder engagement exercise and (c) peer reviews and sustainability benchmarking. This would help to ensure that our priority SDGs are aligned at the industry level.

The three factors considered from an internal perspective were: (a) the 11 SDGs we have been supporting since 2015 (b) the 19 identified material topics and (c) the Group’s core competence and business direction.

An aggregated score was then calculated for each SDG. This exercise distilled and identified six priority SDGs where Singtel Group can best contribute and create impact.

Building a sustainable future for all requires the commitment and effort of all stakeholders in the ecosystem. SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals – therefore underpins our sustainability strategy as we seek to collaborate with our stakeholders to create shared value and positive impact.

# Climate Change and Environment

We are committed to minimising our environmental impact and building operational resilience for the long-term benefit of our business and communities.

With digitisation accelerated further by COVID-19, communities and economies are highly dependent on reliable communication networks. As the effects of climate change lead to worsening natural disasters, our stakeholders are more concerned with the reliability of our corporate and network infrastructure, and our network adaptation measures to mitigate these risks.

For our business, the biggest waste stream is e-waste due to the increased use of digital devices driven by ICT and IoT solutions. With greater concerns over pollution to the natural environment, governments are giving greater attention to the circular economy, with many requiring companies to ensure product stewardship from ‘source to sink’ – upstream resource to end-of-life management.

Addressing climate change is one of the most pressing issues that the world faces today. From our regular stakeholder engagement between 2014 and 2020, we saw increasing focus on climate issues in our materiality review. Stakeholders are concerned with our carbon emissions from powering communication and connectivity, especially the high energy consumption by data centres.

The Singtel Group strives to address our stakeholder concerns to achieve ‘the smallest footprint’ on our environment. This includes rallying our partners and vendors in the ecosystem to collaborate innovatively and achieve greater positive outcomes. We are also committed to supporting communities that are adversely affected by climate-related disasters as part of our climate action.

# About this Report

# Contents

Our environment and climate action strategy is guided by our Environmental Management System and Environment Policy to manage and minimise our environmental impact. Please refer to our website for more information. The subsequent sections describe how we intend to meet and exceed these expectations. We understand the importance of communicating how we manage our climate-related risks and opportunities to maintain stakeholder trust and confidence. As one of the first companies globally to endorse the TCFD framework in 2017, which aims to help financial institutions and investors understand the financial implications of climate risks on businesses, we had earlier structured our climate risks and management approach according to TCFD guidelines. It will provide our stakeholders with a comprehensive view of our risk assessment and climate strategy. This disclosure format is another step of our commitment to accelerate action and progress for this agenda.

# CLIMATE ACTION

# Advancing the climate agenda in alignment with the TCFD framework

The topic of climate change and environment has always been an important agenda for the Singtel Group since it first appeared on our materiality register in 2014. We have been refining our approach in tackling both risks and opportunities of climate change over the years.

# Climate Change & Environment

This has allowed us to achieve critical milestones in our climate action and environmental journey, which in turn provides us with a clearer view to make informed business decisions.

# Singtel Group’s TCFD alignment and highlights

# 1. Governance

The Singtel Group has put in place governance structure and processes that effectively engage the Board, management and working groups through robust discussions and reviews. This ensures that material climate-related issues and opportunities across the geographies we operate in are adequately addressed through science-based analysis and action.

The Risk Management Committee and the Board Risk Committee review climate risks, while the Singtel Board is briefed on climate risks using the TCFD Framework.

Designated members of the Singtel Management Committee provide oversight and stewardship on Singtel Group’s carbon reduction strategy.

From FY2021, climate-related KPIs formed 20% of ESG KPIs for our top management’s long-term incentive.

# 2. Risk assessment and management

We continue to strengthen our understanding of climate risks and opportunities, and their corresponding impact on the business through assessment, research and partnership. We clearly define our physical and transitional risks by considering different scenarios, variables and drivers in our business, as well as the broader business and regulatory environment. This informs our strategy, investment decision and business operating model to ensure that we are resilient to the impact of climate change.

In preparation for a nationwide TCFD exercise in Singapore and Australia in FY2022, we undertook a pilot study of a physical and transitional climate scenario analysis in Northern Rivers, a high-risk region in New South Wales, Australia, to identify material drivers and indicators.

The relatively limited damage to our networks during the massive Australian bushfire and floods between 2019 and early 2021 demonstrated that we can effectively mitigate against physical risks from climate change through proactive and progressive upgrades using adaptive network design considerations.

Transitional risks related to ‘policy shocks’ such as energy efficiency standards or carbon neutral data centre operations are the greatest operational risks in the short term, even if addressable over the longer term. Other transitional risks such as supply chain and decarbonisation risks are manageable over the longer term, even against the extreme scenarios of global warming.

# 3. Strategy and target formulation

To secure a sustainable future for both the planet and our business, the Singtel Group takes a comprehensive and proactive approach in designing and building climate and business resilience into the core of our corporate strategy and operations. We set long-term ambitions to guide mid and short-term targets – aligned through science – to guide our climate strategy and plans. We perform scenario analysis to ensure that our decisions remain robust against the dynamic nature of climate risks and global agenda. We forge collaborative partnerships and constantly innovate because climate risks cannot be addressed by a single party or with conventional thinking.

# Decarbonisation strategy

One, three and five-year carbon and renewable energy targets established to shape our renewable energy PPA tenders to be issued to market in FY2022.

# Partnerships

Undertook an Australia-wide bushfire risk prediction analysis in partnership with CSIRO to determine proactive mitigation and adaptation measures for mobile base station and shelters.

# Innovation

Research partnership with Australian National University to develop advanced image sensing capability for early detection of bushfires in Australia.

# 4. Metrics

We publicly disclose our environmental targets and metrics aligned with GRI as well as our performance data which is externally assured. Our stakeholders can therefore better understand our efforts and progress in this area. We will also communicate any material driver and impact on the company’s income statement, cashflows or balance sheet using the TCFD framework.

The following sections share in greater detail our governance approach, risk and opportunity assessment framework, strategy, targets and metrics for climate action.

# 2. Conducting climate risk assessments

Over the years, the Singtel Group has conducted various risk and impact assessments to gain a comprehensive understanding of the climate risks, including natural and made-made events, that have an impact on our business. Figure 4 on page 20 summarises our perspectives of these risk and opportunities as well as our strategy.

# 01 Carbon footprint exercise

FY2012: We began our carbon footprint exercise to account for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions across our operations and continued to update this annually. It included additional elements of Scope 2 and 3 emissions from our base stations and property including rented offices to provide a more accurate picture of our emissions.

FY2013: We widened our scope of carbon footprint calculations and undertook an extensive exercise to estimate the impact of our employees’ commute to and from their workplace in Singapore, covering distance, types of transportation and emission factors. From FY2022: We will refresh our Scope 3 carbon analysis by revalidating all 15 categories of carbon in our value chain.

# 02 Materiality assessment

We conduct a formal materiality assessment every five years to identify material environmental areas of concern across our business and follow up with targets to ensure our sustainability strategy is focused on areas where we can make the biggest positive change. It is based on four key sources:

- Ongoing stakeholder engagement
- In-depth survey with management and external stakeholders
- Life cycle assessment (LCA)
- Peer review and benchmarking

FY2010 and FY2014: In FY2010, we conducted our first assessment to identify material environmental issues that reflected the sustainability landscape for Singtel at that time. In FY2014, we performed a Group-wide assessment to include our operations in Australia which resulted in two strategic themes of Climate Change and Energy Management as well as Product Stewardship, our two material environmental topics. In the same year, we updated the Singtel Group Environment Policy, established a new environment strategy and revised our environmental governance structure.

FY2017 and FY2021: We undertook an interim materiality assessment in FY2017 and our third formal materiality assessment for Singtel and Optus to identify any major shift in priorities and emerging areas of concern to reflect the ever-changing landscape and evolving interests and needs of our stakeholders. Climate-related risks were considered the most important/high impact compared to FY2017 which was of moderate importance/high impact.

# 03 Life cycle and supply chain sustainability assessments

We conduct life cycle and supply chain sustainability assessments to consider environmental risks across our supply chain. We also review and update our Supplier Code of Conduct with environmental considerations, as part of and to supplement the materiality assessment findings.

FY2016: We carried out our first environmental LCA in FY2016 across our Singapore and Australia operations to better understand the material environmental aspects throughout our extended business networks. We identified that our supply chain (Scope 3) constituted two-thirds of our Group’s carbon footprint. This insight was essential as this formed the basis for setting the Group’s Scope 3 science based carbon targets which was approved by SBTi in October 2017 (see page 16). We updated our Supplier Code of Conduct to address key issues identified by LCA, particularly in the area of climate change, carbon and waste management, and clarified expectations in new contracts with our main suppliers.

FY2021: We updated our organisational LCA to identify any new or emerging issues in our value chain (see pages 55-56).

# 04 Climate scenario assessment and adaptation exercise

FY2016: We commenced our first climate scenario assessment and adaptation exercise for our Singapore and Australian operations, working with CSIRO and our consultant when the issue of climate risk first emerged as a material priority for our stakeholders. See Table 4 on page 25, where we highlight our strategic initiatives in response to the physical risks assessment that we conducted.

FY2021: We built on FY2016 findings, updated and widened our scenario planning with a pilot in Northern Rivers region, New South Wales, Australia to refine the modelling and validate the material drivers and assumptions that have an impact on the company’s financials as a result of both physical and transitional risks (see pages 20-22).

FY2022: We plan to expand our climate scenario research to a national level study for Australia and Singapore in FY2022. We will also work with our regional associates on their preparations for TCFD.

# Preparing for Enhanced TCFD

What: A pilot exercise for TCFD scenario analysis

Where: Northern Rivers region, New South Wales, Australia

Why: To update our Physical Risks from climate change and establish our first view of Transitional Risks to a low carbon economy

In the second half of FY2021, we undertook a detailed and bottom-up pilot programme to conduct a financial driver and materiality modelling assessment of both physical and transition climate impacts on the Northern Rivers and other regions in New South Wales, Australia. The outcomes would enable us to improve our understanding of the business’ overall risk profile in relation to Optus and Singtel Group’s financials. We can then use the knowledge and implement specific actions to improve our resilience to climate change within the Northern Rivers region where we have seen major changes in climatic patterns over the past decade.

More importantly, the exercise helped us to identify key climate scenarios and design and planning parameters in network deployment which will be applied to an Australian nationwide exercise next year. We also identified the most material transitional risks under extreme scenarios and over different time periods, which will inform our strategy in managing and mitigating transitional risks related to transition to a low carbon economy across the Singtel Group.

# Methodology

We carried out climate scenario and risk analysis using three different climate scenarios:

- Scenario 1: Orderly transition with warming limited to 2°C by 2100 (RCP 2.6)
- Scenario 2: Disruptive decarbonisation with warming limited to 2°C by 2100 (RCP 2.6)
- Scenario 3: Delayed action with warming exceeding 4°C by 2100 (RCP 8.5)

# Scenarios and Time Horizons

We looked at the possible impact over three time-horizons: short (2030), medium (2040), and long-term (2050 and beyond) to better understand the following: (a) Alternative views of future climate trajectories (b) Key areas in our value chain likely to be affected (c) Robustness of our existing strategies and (d) Opportunities to proactively undertake mitigations.

We used scenarios 1 and 2 to stress test the transition impact on our business, as they presented policy transitions with the greatest business impact. We used scenarios 1 and 3 to stress test the physical impact on our business, as they presented a range of physical climate impact on our business. We then assessed each scenario over the three time-horizons.

# Scenario

|Scenario One:|Orderly transition|Warming limited to 2°C by 2100 RCP 2.6|
|---|---|---|
|Scenario Two:|Disruptive decarbonisation|Warming limited to 2°C by 2100 RCP 2.6|
|Scenario Three:|Delayed action|Warming exceeds 4°C by 2100 RCP 8.5|

# Key insights from pilot exercise

# (A) Transition risks and opportunities*

*The transition impact assessment was based on best available information, subject to certain assumptions and limitations. For example, as the Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) specific to Northern Rivers region was limited, the Northern Rivers revenue as a percentage of total Singtel Group revenue was used as a proxy before factoring new 5G rollout and Data Centres to calculate the apportionment of EBIT to establish an initial baseline for downstream refinement.

Based on qualitative and quantitative assessment, we identified three transition risk levers that potentially would have the most impact on our business without any intervention or mitigation. We then outlined our strategic response to each risk lever. Overall, early action poses a lower level of economic disruption, especially over the next ten years (see Table 2 on page 22).

# (B) Physical risks and opportunities*

*The physical impact assessment was based on best available information, subject to certain assumptions and limitations. For example, the assessment focused on current assets and did not account for planned assets for 5G rollout and new data centres which we have the opportunity to factor in updated adaptation and design principles.

We performed this assessment at an asset level, overlaying local climate hazards, asset costs and our business assets’ cross-dependencies. We analysed 2,500 assets across six physical hazards: coastal inundation, forest fire, riverine flooding, extreme heat, extreme wind (storms) and soil contraction (drought).

1. Overall, forest fires, and coastal and riverine inundation are critical hazards we should focus our resilience efforts on.
- Forest fires are projected to have the highest financial impact on capital expenditure for asset repair or replacement in 2030 and 2050.
- Risks from coastal and riverine inundation are expected to moderately increase in 2030 and 2050, with the highest financial impact projected in 2100.
2. Site towers and site shelters are the asset types projected to incur the highest average Technical Insurance Premium due to physical climate change, increasing from about A$2,000 to A$4,000 per asset from 2030 to 2050 without proactive and adaptive network design and deployment.
3. Capital expenditure should be focused on network design and standards, and infrastructure resilience of site shelters and towers against forest fires in the near to medium term, and against coastal inundation in the long-term. We have since identified three critical sites due to their coastal locations, forest fire risk or high dependencies of the business on these sites.

# About this Report

# Contents

|Lever|Risk level of findings*|Potential impact on business without mitigation|Singtel Group’s strategic response and mitigation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Capital allocation|Material risk:|Policy uncertainty over energy efficiency requirements may lead to abrupt retirement of less energy-efficient network assets in a policy shock, causing material financial impact at the EBIT level around FY2030.|We regularly conduct early planning into capital upgrades and always adopt the most energy efficient technologies in our networks and data centres to minimise the need for early retirement of our network assets. We are well advanced in our legacy chiller replacement programme, resulting in significant carbon abatement.|
|Counterparty risk|Minor to Moderate risk:|Counterparty risk poses the smallest risk to our business, due to the maturity of our current climate ambitions and actions of our major suppliers.|We will continue to be proactive in our climate ambitions and encourage our suppliers to do the same.|
|Carbon pricing|Minor risk and potential for positive impact:|Energy cost is less than 5% of total operating costs of Singtel and Optus even after factoring in growth scenarios and incremental carbon pricing scenarios.|Increased carbon pricing is likely to drive acceleration of decarbonisation of the energy grid and economy at a more consistent rate. This will provide us with more opportunities and potential cost savings from early investment in low carbon technologies and products. We will also drive decarbonisation of our business as summarised in Figure 5 on page 23.|

* For purpose of our pilot TCFD financial materiality review, we defined ‘Material’ as >10% impact to EBIT, ‘Moderate’ is 5-10% impact to EBIT and ‘Minor’ is <5% impact to EBIT under extreme scenarios and shocks and assumed no mitigation was in place.

# Not without risks in Australia:

Too fast too soon into renewable energy!

As companies look to accelerate their transition to low carbon, this is not without its share of transitional risks. In Australia, these risks include:

- Reliable energy generation from wind and solar farms due to variable weather conditions
- Lack of economical battery storage to guarantee supply given that critical telecommunications infrastructure requires reliable and consistent energy supply 24/7
- Legacy power transmission grid constraints limit full generation capacity of renewable energy projects
- Signing energy pricing contracts at a higher price with falling wholesale market or future price of renewable energy

For example in 2015, extreme fluctuations of wind and solar supply in South Australia combined with coal power plants shutdown led to critical shortage of energy supply and skyrocketing wholesale energy prices. In 2020, COVID-19 led to the collapse of world oil and gas prices resulting in significant reduction in wholesale energy prices. Some Australian companies that entered early into PPAs had to write down legacy renewable energy assets and account for derivative losses.

# Example of Transitional Risks in Singapore: Carbon Neutral Data Centres?

A Singapore government moratorium was earlier issued that new data centre developments would be considered only from 2021. Data centres consume a huge amount of energy and are a key energy growth driver in Singapore given the increased in cloud services and the country’s position as a regional data centre hub (Singapore is the second most attractive city globally according to Arcadis Data Centre Location Index 2021). Should a decision be made at a policy level that all new data centres must be fully carbon neutral, it could be an example of transitional risk to a low carbon economy.

# 3. Strategy and target formulation

The Singtel Group’s climate strategy and targets are framed by two perspectives aligned with TCFD: our impact on and from climate change (see Figure 4). In the previous section, we described the key climate risks and opportunities, and their financial impact on our revenue and balance sheet, to help define our strategy in managing these risks and opportunities well.

# Figure 5: Our Decarbonisation Options

Most Preferred (Absolute zero emission)

We have earlier set 2030 SBTi-approved carbon reduction targets for our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and net zero target by 2050. Our interim target is to achieve 25% renewable energy by 2025 for our Scope 2 needs in Singapore and Australia.

In this section, we articulate our efforts to support the strategies aimed at driving long-term business sustainability.

We adopt two broad strategies to drive climate action and resilience in response to the identified risks and opportunities. First, we will drive decarbonisation in our business (i.e. impact on climate change) to reduce our carbon emissions and enable transition to low carbon economy by providing innovative products and services to customers.

Second, we will increase our business’ climate resilience through proactive adaptation (i.e. impact from climate change) to reduce impact from physical risks on our network infrastructure as a result of extreme weather events. This is to remain operationally resilient to serve the communication needs of our customers and communities.

# A) Addressing transitional risks through decarbonisation in our business

Our commitment to achieving a climate conscious future is demonstrated by the aggressive corporate decarbonisation goals and targets we have set. We were able to focus our actions on creating tangible and measurable impact over the years. Our options and priorities for decarbonisation are summarised in Figure 5.

# a) Our energy efficiency and efforts

We have been working on several programmes targeting energy reduction across key energy intensive touch points of our operations in Singapore and Australia, such as network infrastructure, data centres, satellite earth stations and office buildings (see Table 3 on page 24). More details on our approach can be found at our website.

Least Preferred (Net emissions)

# b) Increasing use of onsite renewable energy deployment

Renewable energy has always been integral in the design and construction of our infrastructure. Since the installation of photovoltaic panels at our Pasir Ris Telephone Exchange in 2009, we have progressively increased the use of renewable energy in our infrastructure. In October 2019, we signed our first solar PPA in Singapore which saw the installation of a 1.65 MWp solar power system on the rooftop of our NCS Bedok Data Centre. The system, commissioned in March 2020, was one of the largest single-roof solar-powered data centres in Southeast Asia.

|

# Our Sustainability Approach

We also launched UNBOXED, our 24/7 unmanned pop-up retail store, that is hybrid powered by solar. To date, 4,555 MWh solar energy has been generated by our various projects.

We place strong focus on using renewable energy at our data centres which typically account for more than 50% of operating expenses. Next year, we will call for vendor proposals in Singapore and Australia to assess the technical and commercial feasibility of our corporate properties and equipment buildings with the most potential for solar deployment. This is also in line with supporting Singapore’s Green Plan 2030 by quadrupling solar energy deployment by 2025.

# Climate Change & Environment

Onsite renewable energy will not make material impact to our decarbonisation efforts given limitations of property and facility space. Offsite renewable energy PPA is an essential part of our strategy over the next few years to achieve the Group’s carbon reduction targets and ambition. However, Singapore has limited local renewable energy supply and Australia has certain risks linked to accelerated PPA deployment (see story on pages 22-23). Hence, we have decided on a risk-and-commercial balanced approach by staging the procurement of renewable energy over different projects and time periods.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

In late 2020, towards the tail-end of a tender process for a major renewable energy supply for our New South Wales operations in Australia, COVID-19 and collapsing global oil and gas prices significantly undermined the viability of the tender offers which we decided not to award given the added commercial and project risks. We are reviewing our renewable energy roadmap for our Australian operations, factoring in the latest market outlook, and plan to call for a tender in FY2022.

In Singapore, we acquired a small supply of renewable energy through the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates equivalent to 1,000 MWh of energy during the year. At the time of preparing this report, we were about to call for a tender for renewable energy supply in line with our decarbonisation targets for our Singapore operations. We target to achieve 25% renewable energy by 2025 for our Scope 2 needs in Singapore and Australia, to be in line with our 2030 SBTi carbon reduction targets.

Our reliable network and ICT services and solutions enable our corporate customers to telecommute and maintain productivity, while lowering carbon emissions from reduced transportation.

Optus achieved a re-accreditation of ISO 22301 for our Business Continuity System, a global acknowledgement of our ability to sustain critical business functionality during any disaster or pandemic.

# d) Carbon offsets

We have always viewed carbon offsets as a last resort for hard to achieve Scope 2 decarbonisation, or only for the purpose of offsetting Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions. Non-renewable energy carbon offsets are also not yet recognised by SBTi for the purpose of meeting Scope 2 reduction targets. To date, we have not acquired any carbon offset but we are monitoring the standards, accounting treatment, government recognition and other developments closely and will review our position. In FY2022, we will undertake an updated assessment on all categories of our Scope 3 carbon footprint.

# e) Leveraging Green ICT

We constantly explore the unique catalytic role of smart mobile technologies in reducing energy consumption and emissions beyond our industry to benefit other sectors of the economy.

# B) Addressing physical risks through network adaptation for resilience

The climate risk agenda first surfaced as a material topic to our stakeholders in FY2015, and we have since intensified our research and application of viable innovations and technologies over the years to improve business resilience and continue to serve our communities in times of disasters.

We leverage insights from studies to proactively adapt and ensure maximum resilience of our network infrastructure. We also use a combination of internal subject matter experts and climate modelling to identify key network interconnection and vulnerabilities from extreme rainfall intensity and temperature changes on our network.

Mobile technology innovations in the areas of connectivity, data centres, big data and IoT enable the development of energy efficient solutions that can be applied across industries, thus advancing the global climate progress. This is discussed in depth in a report called ‘The Enablement Effect: The impact of mobile communications technologies on carbon emissions reductions’ published by GSMA.

As a result of our 2015 climate scenario analysis, we undertook numerous adaptations across our Singapore and Australia operations to build resilience to natural disasters and long-term climate scenarios (see Table 4). We have progressively adapted our infrastructure design and standards to long-term climate scenarios like increased inundation risks, stronger cyclonic activities, rising temperatures and higher bushfires frequency in Australia.

# About this Report

# Contents

# Research and industry partnerships

The Singtel Group collaborates with partners on innovation and technology to build resilience and capabilities against catastrophic events. We embark on research collaboration and engage subject matter experts at industry and national levels to gather intelligence on climate risks and impact. The insights gathered help prepare us to build resilience through the integration of natural and social science, engineering and other disciplinary approaches to build capacity for climate adaptation and resilience so that we remain ready to respond to any climate-related disruption.

# PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP

Singtel Group’s approach to product stewardship considers the impact of our products and services before they reach our stores, during our operations and after their useful life. We have a range of initiatives in place to minimise our environmental impact in two significant areas: waste management and sustainable packaging.

# Facilitating effective waste management

Electronic, packaging and corporate wastes such as paper are key sources of wastes generated across our operations and value chain. We are committed to reducing, reusing and recycling wherever possible and fully support the national waste management targets like Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan 2030 and Australia’s Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 2020.

# Recycling e-waste

There are global concerns around e-waste being one of the fastest growing categories of waste today. We have been partnering Mobile Muster since 1998 to facilitate the recycling of mobile devices and accessories via our Optus stores. During the year, we diverted 3,394 kg of e-waste from landfills, saving 7.27 tonnes of carbon emissions while conserving 37.11 tonnes of mineral resources as a result of the programme. We also launched a modem recycling programme to supplement Mobile Muster for customers to recycle their old modems at any of our retail stores in Australia.

In Singapore, ReCYCLE, our self-initiated nationwide e-waste recycling programme in partnership with SingPost since 2017, collects and recycles e-waste like mobile phones, chargers, laptops and tablets by recovering reusable metals and components that include copper and aluminium. To date, more than 68,167 kg of reusable metals and components have been collected through our programme. ReCYCLE will be withdrawn from the market as Singtel joins a new regulated e-waste management system in Singapore introduced by the National Environment Agency (NEA) from 1 July 2021.

# People and Future of Work

The ANU-Optus Bushfire Research Centre was also set up to develop a national system to detect bushfires early and put them out within minutes. We have since progressed in the development of an autonomous ground-based and aerial fire detection system through a constellation of satellites to complement the fire detection system to spot and track fires and deploy extinguishing technologies. The programme will run until 2024.

# Community Impact

At the industry level, we exemplify environmental thought leadership by playing a leading role on the GSMA Board and Climate Action Committee, helping to chart the strategic direction in tackling climate change for the ICT and mobile industry. GSMA is an industry organisation that represents the interests of over 750 mobile network operators. At the country level, we actively partner governments and national agencies to understand emerging risks, policies and regulations. In Singapore, we engage the National Climate Change Secretariat and Centre for Liveable Cities as part of 100 Resilient Cities. We also lead business engagement and participate in business roundtables to share and discuss climate risks, TCFD and SBTi.

# Sustainable Value Creation

Sustainable packaging directly and indirectly contributes to our carbon footprint and environmental impact across our value chain, from resource utilisation to product packaging and management of their waste streams. In Singapore, we have begun preparatory work for submission of our packaging data and 3R plans annually to NEA from 2022. We have been committed to the principles of the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) since 2007 to drive systemic change in the way we create, collect and recover our product packaging. Internally, we have developed a Sustainable Packaging Strategy with goals aligned with the National Packaging Waste targets to make all packaging 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. For the fourth consecutive year, Optus was awarded the APCO Award for our sustainable packaging achievements and efforts in the telecommunications sector.

# People and Future of Work

When COVID-19 hit, we swiftly formed the Pandemic Control Committee that focused on business continuity planning and executing safe management and distancing measures to support our employees and customers. This included developing a COVID-19 staff portal to engage employees and provide them with a centralised source of pandemic-related news as we implemented various precautionary measures and issued regular advisories to update employees on the latest developments.

As local transmission escalated, workforce segregation was implemented. Across the company, we needed to quickly prepare the necessary hardware and software for our employees to work from home, ensuring they could access corporate systems remotely and avoiding disruptions to operations.

# Climate Change & Environment

Gearing up on digital enablement for employee experience. The pandemic accelerated our digital transformation with focus on two key areas: deepening the digital-first mindset and advancing the digitisation of processes, while increasing employee empowerment.

We introduced telemedicine for Singapore employees, enabling them to consult a doctor virtually when ill and avoid health risks at the height of COVID-19 transmission in Singapore. Prescriptions were also delivered to employees’ doorsteps and this was covered by our group medical insurance.

# Welcome Aboard!

The first day of work could be daunting for some, especially when they were unable to meet colleagues and dived straight into working from home. At Singtel, our new hires in Group IT received a warm welcome from the senior leadership team during their first week of work and got to know fellow colleagues – virtually!

Bevan Tan, who joined Group IT as a Senior Architect, said: “I am impressed by the onboarding process. Sabu Bhatia, VP of Digital Technology, greeted me and fellow new joiners in my first week. The experience was more personal than your typical onboarding, and it was interesting hearing Sabu share his personal experiences and how he was coping with working from home.”

We also launched iConnect, a platform which allows our employees to securely access all frequently used corporate apps via a single sign-on while on the move. This portal brings even more convenience and enhanced experience to employees.

The importance of employee experience was never more apparent than during the circuit breaker. We launched a weekly pulse survey to solicit feedback from our Singapore-based employees, especially after being away from the workplace for prolonged periods. Through data collected and analysis, we were able to understand and address the top concerns of remote-working employees, for example:

1. Time management and setting clear boundaries between work and personal time
2. Home conditions that were not conducive for working
3. Managers who were not empathetic
4. IT and connectivity issues
5. Increased mental stress and loneliness due to being cooped up at home

Candidate selection, reduce hiring paperwork which is now delivered electronically through DocuSign, and revamp the new hire orientation with e-onboarding (see boxed story, Welcome Aboard!).

# Promoting employee well-being

In Singapore, we moved many of our employee events online. We organised our Mother’s Day 2020 event which saw management members and employees perform and pay tribute to mothers, Singapore National Day celebrations, as well as regular health and wellness webinars and live online fitness sessions.

About a thousand employees participated in activities that encouraged self-discovery and learnt coping strategies during our month-long Mindfulness Challenge held in conjunction with World Mental Health Day. Throughout the circuit breaker, workplace counselling, under our Work Life Coaching Programme in Singapore and HR Critical Incident Hotline in Australia, was made available round the clock to assist employees and family members with various work-life balance and job matters.

As a follow-up, respective business units brought forward workflow digitisation projects with urgency, and redesigned jobs to facilitate remote working and simplified systems access. We also took the opportunity to introduce virtual interviews as a regular feature for good employment practices.

# Good employment practices

The Singtel Group employed 22,914 people, comprising 12,391 in Singapore, 7,687 in Australia and the rest based around the world as at 31 March 2021.

# About this Report

# Contents

In Singapore, we abide by the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) Employment Act and ensure that employment practices are aligned with the tripartite guidelines set by MOM, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP). In Australia, our industrial relations frameworks comply with the requirements of the Fair Work Act and ensure employees’ rights to freedom of association.

We have fostered a very strong and collaborative partnership with the Union of Telecom Employees (UTES) in Singapore since its inception in 1982. As at 31 March 2021, we had 4,743 bargainable employees (38.3%) in Singapore covered by collective agreement and 2,629 employees (34%) covered by the Employment Partnership Agreement in Australia. We support NTUC’s U Care Fund with an annual donation of S$100,000. During the year, we disbursed S$39,566 to 66 schooling children of our staff under the joint Singtel-UTES Bursary Awards scheme.

# Our Sustainability Approach

The two tertiary institutions will support the industry by developing 5G-related training courses and academic programmes. They will also collaborate with other tertiary institutions to provide hands-on training opportunities through 5G research laboratories and facilities, such as the 5G Garage at SP set up in collaboration with Singtel and Ericsson. Trainees will undergo structured training coupled with work experience with us to develop and hone their 5G domain expertise and related skills (read more).

# BUILDING A FUTURE-READY WORKFORCE

# Talent development and future skills

The Singtel Group continued to invest significantly in our employees’ training and development to the tune of S$16.8 million for the year to keep our people agile and future-ready. Our annual Singtel Group Learning Fiesta 2020 was held completely virtually for the first time due to the pandemic. We saw a record-breaking 43,000 learning places taken up across our global footprint during the month-long event, representing a 60% increase from the previous year. Over 4,500 employees participated in tailored webinars and more than 3,500 engaged in specially curated channels in #CURIOUS, Singtel’s mobile digital learning platform.

More employees across the Singtel Group leveraged online learning to acquire new knowledge while working remotely. With access to more than 100,000 curated courses, videos, e-books and audio books in #CURIOUS, employees were able to continue their learning journey and develop new skills without any disruption. Participation in #CURIOUS climbed 32% during the year.

# Investing in our people

Unprecedented amounts of resources and energy were channelled into building capabilities this year. Our key initiatives included onboarding 535 trainees through the SGUnited Traineeship and SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways programmes and professional conversion of 700 existing roles with support from IMDA and Workforce Singapore (WSG). We also signed an agreement with IMDA to hire 250 mid-career people into tech-lite and deep-tech roles via the TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) initiative, for which majority of the S$30 million grant would be disbursed against training and salary costs throughout the 24-month on-the-job-training (OJT) curriculum.

To support Singtel’s foray into emerging technologies such as AI/ML, and specifically 5G, an internal 5G Workforce Transformation Committee was set up to strategise, plan and execute a roadmap to train and convert 2,300 employees and 150 new hires over two years.

# Talent attraction and retention

The key to securing Singtel’s future capabilities is to identify digital talent early, enhance their experience and provide an environment where they can do great work. Investment in continuous development of existing leaders is also critical. With these in mind, we have maintained strategic partnerships with tertiary institutions and leading consultants in Singapore and Australia.

During the year, about 1,000 young talents were nurtured under various programmes, such as Singtel Management Associates, NCS Nucleus 2.0, Optus Graduates, scholarships, apprenticeships and internships. Creating a positive experience is an endorsement of our talent branding among the young and future leaders. Our Talent Ambassador Programme provides such a platform for our young talents to share with their friends and schoolmates their strong testament to an exciting career with us.

For our existing leaders, we piloted leadership development programmes, Nexus in NCS and ACE in our enterprise business unit, with about 600 leaders, and plan to roll out across the rest of Singtel next year. The curriculum is designed to strengthen their capability in leading with Accountability, leading Change and leading with Empathy. Coaching skills and guided practice workshops have also been incorporated, enabling leaders to adapt their leadership style, overcome cultural barriers and foster mindset change. Similarly, the Future Shapers programme was piloted in Optus Networks and Optus Enterprise units for our leaders in Australia.

Apart from learning and career development opportunities, we ensure that our remuneration and benefits policies, among others, remain competitive to attract and retain talents. Despite the tumultuous year, employee engagement was up 10% from a year ago in the annual Your Voice Survey 2020.

# Supporting the SGUnited Traineeships and SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programmes

In June 2020, when the job market was adversely affected by the pandemic, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore (WSG) introduced the SGUnited Traineeships (SGUT) and SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways (SGUP) programmes to support graduates and mid-career individuals in boosting their employability and gaining new skills.

Under the programmes, we supported 535 trainees at both Singtel and NCS for up to 12 months and received an 80% grant from the government, estimated at S$12 million in total, for stipends paid to our trainees. These trainees were deployed throughout the company in various business functions.

Given our active support, then Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and former Manpower Minister Josephine Teo visited us on 15 December 2020. We shared how we drove recruitment, the types of roles available, our trainees’ profiles and the various training programmes we provided to boost their employability.

Singtel was recognised as the Employer of Choice in Asia at the HR Fest Awards 2020 for being an all-rounder in our HR practices. We were lauded for our excellent work-life balance initiatives, rewards schemes, diversity and inclusion policies, talent management, succession planning and training and development programmes. This is a result of our strong focus on employee engagement as we recognise its correlation to employee and customer satisfaction as well as business results. The success of our policies and efforts are reflected in various forms such as a high staff engagement score. We continue to invest in and provide our employees with development and career opportunities. We want to create a highly engaged and dedicated workforce and help our people achieve their full potential professionally and personally.

# CULTIVATING AN INCLUSIVE CULTURE THAT EMPOWERS

A diverse workforce brings perspectives and creativity to the table that trigger new ideas, promote innovation and drive breakthrough performance.

We are committed to upholding and protecting the human rights of all individuals through a culture of trust, respect and inclusion at Singtel. We do not discriminate based on their backgrounds, beliefs and abilities for reasons including gender, race, age, disabilities or irrelevant criminal record.

In line with our Singtel Group Code of Conduct, we are committed to providing employees with a work environment that is conducive, safe and free from discrimination and harassment. We also prohibit any form of retaliation against any person for making reports in good faith concerning allegations of discrimination, harassment, violation of the Code of Conduct or any other allegation of improper behaviour.

Grievance mechanisms are maintained to allow our stakeholders, including employees, to raise genuine concerns and report any adverse human rights impact that may happen within our operations and supply chains. Our Whistleblower hotline allows employees, contractors and others to report any grievance or concern through an independent channel. If we caused or contributed to human rights harm, we will ensure due diligence, proper review and prompt implementation of corrective and preventive measures.

Top on our agenda is to create a vibrant workforce, one with multi-faceted backgrounds and experiences, through our diversity and inclusion policies and practices. We continue with our efforts to increase the representation of women in our senior leadership and technical roles. Diversity and Inclusion Councils in Singapore and Australia with leadership representation have been established to accelerate this agenda.

We commemorated International Women’s Day 2021 with a ‘Winning with Diversity’ campaign, comprising related webinars and special features on our female colleagues who are role models and inspiration for many.

# Commitment to Accessibility and Inclusion

In line with our commitment to be a disability-confident employer in Australia, we developed a renewed Optus Accessibility and Inclusion Action Plan 2020-2023 to guide us in building an inclusive and accessible workplace for our people, customers and the communities we serve. We focus on four priority areas:

1. Enabling Work to foster an accessible, supportive and inclusive workplace with equal opportunities for everyone to participate
2. Enabling Customer Experience by ensuring our products, services and support are accessible to customers with disabilities
3. Enabling Communities by connecting people with disabilities to reach their potential through our digital technologies and innovative community programmes
4. Enabling Innovations that enable the development of assistive and enabling technologies that support independent living and employability

# Our Sustainability Approach

# Climate Change & Environment

In Singapore, the Singtel-Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Women in Tech Scholarship was launched during the year to inspire female talents to pursue a science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) career. This programme aims to groom future female leaders in ICT.

Our gender diversity efforts have been recognised by the 2021 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the third consecutive year. We were also included in the Refinitiv Global Diversity & Inclusion Index 2020 for the second time. The ‘Singapore 100 Women in Tech’ 2020 list, which celebrated the contributions and achievements of women in the tech sector, included former Singtel Group CEO Chua Sock Koong and Wynthia Goh, Head of Next Digital, NCS.

In Australia, we partnered the Australian Network on Disability (AND) by connecting jobseekers with disabilities to Optus senior leaders through the PACE Mentoring programme. In 2020, we participated in the Stepping Into programme, AND’s paid internship scheme that matches talented university students with disabilities with roles in leading businesses. Both programmes provide an opportunity for us to tap into future talent pools to drive better customer outcomes and innovation locally.

# Community Impact

In Singapore, Singtel played an active role in connecting with the broader ecosystem of partners to advance the disability employment agenda. We were one of eight companies that founded the SBNoD to advance equitable employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. As its co-chair, we continued to support SG Enable’s mentorship and internship programmes for tertiary students with disabilities, as well as university career fairs and CV clinics. Against the backdrop of COVID-19, a series of webinars were convened to discuss best practices and strategies to support disability inclusion going forward.

# Launch of the Optus purpose

During the year, we developed a distinctive Optus powered culture, which has our purpose and vision at the core, to attract the best people to work for us and support our customer-centric strategy. We also defined eight critical people behaviours that define our success.

Examples of these behaviours include taking ownership and following up, and articulating implications before acting, where we remind our people to pause and reflect before engaging.

3. Workplace safety and health metrics are based on the International Labour Organization (ILO) definitions, subject to country definition of lost work shifts e.g. Optus excludes weekends from medical leave when calculating these rates.
4. Optus FY2020 figures have been adjusted to include a case in Australia which happened during that year but recognised by the insurance company only in FY2021.
5. Based on ILO’s definition this excluded time lost as a result of an Optus employee’s permanent incapacity for work. There was one claim in February 2020 due to a brain aneurysm. This is an injury not caused by an incident at work but rather it occurred while the employee was at work. The employee is not expected to be able to return to work.

# DIGITAL ENABLEMENT

Despite the high digital penetration in Singapore and Australia, a small vulnerable segment of society still lacks digital access due to various socio-economic reasons. COVID-19 has made these gaps more pronounced. Vulnerable seniors and underprivileged students who were already struggling to stay connected faced even more challenges with social distancing measures during the pandemic.

Digital enablement is at the core of our community strategy. The Singtel Group, as a leading communications technology company, is uniquely placed to leverage our digital services, resources and competence to help communities reap the full benefits of digitisation, especially vulnerable groups who may be left behind. Community bonds are also strengthened through increased connectivity.

The Singtel Group works closely with government agencies and charity partners to bridge the digital divide. We tap on our strengths in ICT to support the vulnerable and underserved population with digital access and skills to improve their daily lives and livelihood. This is also part of our support for Singapore’s aim to become a Smart Nation.

Singtel staff volunteers guiding seniors on using digital devices and services at weekly hands-on sessions

We recognise the unintended consequences of a digital lifestyle and focus on safe and responsible use of digital media and devices. We promote cyber wellness and online safety among vulnerable groups, especially children and youth.

# Empowering seniors to go digital

In Singapore, COVID-19 limited seniors’ social interactions due to safe distancing measures. To ease the social isolation, Singtel launched Singtel Digital Silvers, a programme which enables seniors to stay digitally connected. Our staff volunteers guide the seniors through one-on-one tutorials to build digital literacy and confidence using smartphones and mobile apps. The seniors also receive practical tips on scam calls and how to stay safe in the online world.

Figure 3: Singtel Digital Silvers

As part of the initiative, we will invest more than S$1 million to transform Senior Activity Centres (SACs) into digital hubs that promote active ageing. The centres will be upgraded with our high-speed fibre connection and Singtel TV ethnic content for the seniors to stay connected and entertained.

Many seniors prefer face-to-face interactions. Hence, besides the weekly one-on-one sessions conducted by our staff volunteers at SACs, we hold weekly silver workshops at all our Singtel Shops before opening hours. These sessions strictly adhere to the national safe distancing measures and capacity guidelines. During the year, we empowered 500 seniors with basic digital knowledge and smartphone features like camera and voice messaging. Under the guidance of our dedicated staff volunteers, these seniors now have more confidence using mobile phones and apps.

# Helping disadvantaged youth stay connected

In Australia, we launched a digital inclusion initiative Donate Your Data in late-2019 to help bridge the digital divide for the 1.1 million young Australians living in poverty. Our mobile customers can donate their data to young Australians who need it most. The data donated will be pooled and shared with young people supported by our charity partners such as ABCN, KARI Foundation and The Smith Family. To date, we have seen 25.5 million GB of data donated by more than 440,000 customers which helped about 15,000 students in Australia.

During the year, we expanded the programme to telehealth, partnering Sydney Children’s Hospitals Foundation. We support the hospital’s network telehealth model of care by ensuring that young Australians receive quality care remotely through mobile data access. The hospital saw over 1,500% increase in the use of telehealth and 80% of consultations in certain departments were delivered virtually.

# Helping SMEs go digital

In September 2020, we launched Let’s Get Digital, a programme that guides SMEs in Singapore on their digitisation journey, offering ICT service consultation and support at no charge. SMEs can seek advice from our digital specialists on matters such as safeguarding data and strengthening security controls, digital sales and marketing, and simplifying and digitising processes to increase productivity. These solutions are selected and implemented based on the SMEs’ growth stages and needs. Find out more about our range of solutions here.

SMEs also enjoy complimentary access to other Singtel resources, such as monthly webinars, digital clinics and advice on the various government grant schemes for digital solutions.

# People and Future of Work

“When we first expanded our business online, it was quite daunting to handle the influx of orders and enquiries from our website, social media channels, and marketplace portals. Through Singtel’s Let’s Get Digital, we received dedicated guidance on onboarding and getting the most out of solutions that we were unfamiliar with. This includes Singtel’s Shoptiq platform, which helped us become truly omnichannel through the integration of the channels we use. It provides analytics on our customers’ interaction and purchase history, and enables personalised engagement campaigns, which increase conversion rates.”

Encouraging hawker centres to embrace digital payments

Digital payment systems can help hawker centre stallholders improve their productivity. Not only does it reduce cash handling, it also eliminates physical contact in today’s COVID-19 environment. However, adoption has been slow.

Through encouraging the use of Singtel Dash, our mobile wallet, we wanted to inculcate the habit of making digital payments at hawker centres with a Tingkat giveaway by rewarding diners who made multiple Dash transactions when buying meals. The use of Tingkat, a Malay word for multi-layered food carrier, also protects the environment by replacing disposable containers for meal takeaways.

# Scaling social innovation

Launched in 2016, Singtel Group Future Makers is a capacity building programme for social impact start-ups and enterprises. We support promising social innovation solutions that create positive social and healthcare impact for the vulnerable in society.

Our ecosystem of partners comprises the non-profit sector, social enterprises, corporates and venture capital companies. Their engagement and support come in many forms such as programme partners, mentors and speakers. Our in-house subject matter experts from various business units such as digital marketing, HR, legal and strategy, are involved in roles like mentors and coaches as part of our skilled volunteering effort.

Singtel Future Makers 2020 start-ups attending a virtual engagement session with Singtel stakeholders

In Singapore, the theme of Singtel Future Makers 2020 programme was ‘shared value’. We supported five social impact start-ups with a S$150,000 grant pool. They worked on a shared value proof of concept to create joint opportunities for themselves, Singtel’s business units, the community and social service agencies.

Against the backdrop of COVID-19, we also awarded two Singtel Future Makers alumni with a Special Pandemic Support Grant to support their digital solutions that tackle social and community challenges posed by the pandemic. Read our Future Makers Impact Report 2019 and 2020 here.

In Australia, Optus Future Makers supported five social impact start-ups with a A$200,000 grant pool to further their innovations using technology to tackle challenging social issues. The start-ups were supported by dedicated Optus coaches and received exclusive training in areas such as product and tech development, marketing strategies, pitch training and making strong social impact. Find out more about Optus Future Makers 2020 here.

# Online safety and well-being

Digital devices have benefited society in the way we learn, work, play and interact. However, the same technologies have also given rise to unintended consequences, especially for children and youth who are more digitally connected than ever. They are exposed to risks such as device and gaming addiction, inappropriate online content and cyber bullying.

This situation could worsen with COVID-19. With safe distancing measures and digital learning, the increase in unregulated screen time and content access could exacerbate the online risks for the younger ones. Since FY2016, the Singtel Group Digital Thumbprint programme has equipped more than 600,000 students, educators and parents with skills and knowledge to stay safe online. Our programme has also evolved to meet the changing needs and landscapes in our markets.

We are heartened that the Singapore government has taken on a greater role in implementing cyber wellness curriculum for students, including special education schools. In FY2015, we created a cyber wellness toolkit for teachers to impart critical knowledge to children with special needs. In consultation with our strategic community partners, we have pivoted our programme to support parents and caregivers who are responsible for monitoring online risks and creating a healthy environment to support their children’s digital intelligence, as well as social and emotional growth.

# Helping families manage digital risks

In collaboration with TOUCH, we recently incorporated the resources provided by our notAnoobie app for parents into the newly revamped Help123, an integrated cyber wellness and digital parenting online platform. Help123, launched in July 2017, was co-funded by Singtel in partnership with the National Council of Social.

# Community Impact

The success of Help123 has allowed it to continue and be operated under our partnership with TOUCH since 2020. Today, it meets the growing needs of parents and educators to manage cyber wellness issues faced by their young ones. The full suite of services includes a one-stop hotline (1800 6123 123), email, knowledge resources and digital parenting webinars. The revamped Help123 has seen an increase in calls, emails and website traffic. It has also equipped 5,000 parents and children through webinars during the pandemic. Almost every participant reported gaining useful knowledge from these sessions.

We supported the #DQEveryChild Emergency Fund as part of our ongoing strategic collaboration with DQ Institute, at the onset of COVID-19. With the fund, 67,000 children worldwide were given a digital readiness kit to equip them with digital citizenship skills that required minimal support from parents and teachers. With school closure and increased screen time for children, many parents faced difficulties working from home while supervising their children’s online activities. To meet parents’ needs, #DQEveryChild provided Digital Parenting workshops in Singapore that reached about 1,000 parents.

# Sustainable Value Creation

In September 2020, the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) approved the DQ framework as the world’s first global standards for digital skills and literacy. Singtel, together with SkillsFuture Singapore and other partners, supported DQ Institute throughout the IEEE SA process. The DQ framework sets a common language, structure and taxonomy that can be benchmarked, referenced and adopted across nations and sectors worldwide. Any interested party in any country can now use the DQ standards to enhance the level of digital literacy and skills of people to bridge the local digital divide.

# Educating young people in Australia

As a key player in Australia’s digital community, we are committed to helping young people and families be safe, responsible and positive online. Since 2013, we have delivered programmes and supported more than 390,000 primary and secondary school students across Australia through our Digital Thumbprint programme, which encourages positive behavioural change.

During the pandemic, we adopted a hybrid learning model where our facilitators delivered the programme face-to-face in classrooms or via Zoom.

In November 2020, we launched our new teacher-led digital interactive workshops, which cover key topics such as cyber bullying, cyber security and managing screen time. Students can complete the workshops at school or remotely. About 60,000 primary and secondary students, including regional communities, have since completed our workshops across Australia.

# Top telco in Southeast Asia in the Global Child Forum benchmarking study

Singtel was ranked the top telco in the Global Child Forum benchmarking study, ‘The State of Children’s Rights and the Corporate Sector in Southeast Asia 2020’. The study analysed 232 of the largest companies by 2018 revenue and covering eight sectors and six countries in Southeast Asia, on how they implemented children’s rights.

We were recognised for our efforts towards the disadvantaged and vulnerable, including children and youth, through digital inclusion and increased access to products and services, while reducing related risks such as cyber bullying as well as social media and gaming addiction.

# Supporting our customers’ digital well-being

GOMO by Singtel is a no-contract SIM only plan. GOMO’s #DataForGood, launched in March 2021, is a movement rallying GOMO customers to make the online space a better one and encouraging better mental and digital well-being for all in Singapore. For one day each month, GOMO gives out one extra GB of data to customers to do more good. This could include hosting a podcast to spread cheer or rallying support online to help those in need. GOMO customers are also encouraged to share stories and suggestions on how to do good online through GOMO social media.

# Promoting the health and well-being of customers with AIA

In Singapore, we partnered AIA for Singtel StepUp, a wellness platform that allows our postpaid customers to earn local mobile data with every step they take. It also offers lifestyle rewards from AIA and other partners, as well as content on wellness, fitness and nutrition, to encourage Singaporeans to stay active and healthy. Both companies will also co-create innovative insurance products relevant to customers’ increasingly digital lifestyles.

In Australia, we recently announced a game-changing Australian-first innovation, Optus Pause, that allows our customers to pause notifications on their devices through My Optus app and take time off from being ‘plugged in’. This empowers our customers with the freedom to balance their connectivity with time for themselves, families, friends or colleagues.

# Singtel Joins The Valuable 500

The Singtel Group is dedicated to advancing vulnerable segments of society, including persons with disabilities, disadvantaged youths and Indigenous Australians so that they are empowered to lead independent lives.

Singtel demonstrated our commitment towards disability inclusion by being one of the first companies in Singapore to be part of The Valuable 500, a global movement that seeks to place disability on the global leadership agenda. We will continue to work with like-minded businesses and leverage our corporate assets, networks and resources to catalyse disability inclusion locally and globally.

# Inclusion of vulnerable groups

Singtel Touching Lives Fund (STLF) is our flagship corporate philanthropy programme supporting the education of children and youth with special needs in Singapore. Our six beneficiary schools are: APSN Chaoyang School, APSN Tanglin School, APSN Delta Senior School, Cerebral Palsy Alliance Singapore School, Eden School and MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens School. We underwrite all fundraising costs so that every dollar raised goes to the beneficiary schools. STLF has raised S$48 million since 2002.

Due to COVID-19, we were unable to organise our annual Singtel Carnival in late-2020, Singapore’s largest carnival for children with special needs. Instead, we produced a customised multi-purpose pouch and reusable mask for all 6,500 students in the 19 special education schools as a Children’s Day gift. The pouch and mask designs were adapted from the artwork of Tong Tong, a student from MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens School, an STLF beneficiary school.

# Advancing employment of the disadvantaged population

We continue to play an active role in connecting the broader ecosystem of partners to advance the disability employment agenda. Together with like-minded companies, Singtel was one of the eight companies that founded SBNoD to advance equitable employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. As the co-chair of SBNoD, we support SG Enable’s mentorship and internship programmes for tertiary students with disabilities, as well as university career fairs and CV clinics. Amid the pandemic, we convened a series of online webinars to discuss best practices and strategies on how to support disability inclusion in the new normal.

# People and Future of Work

Through our annual Pathways 2 Employment programme in Australia, we support disadvantaged youths by guiding them on job seeking and interviewing skills so they are more employable. This year, we coached 50 students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The programme also benefits our staff mentors who improved their coaching and leadership skills.

# Engaging our people

Keeping our people actively engaged in the community is a key driver of our staff engagement and community impact strategy. We recognise our employees possess the skills, talents and resources for digital enablement of vulnerable segments in the community. It also builds character and enables them to develop soft skills such as empathy.

Our annual staff Your Voice survey 2020 results showed a 10% point improvement in the ESG category, with very strong correlation to the overall staff engagement score. Top reasons cited by staff included engagement by leaders, a supportive work environment, and what the company does in the areas of environment, social, diversity and inclusion.

We encourage our people to volunteer individually or as a team by giving paid volunteer leave, and encouraging business units to adopt VolunTeaming, our concept of teambuilding with a volunteering element. With many of our mass staff volunteering programmes put on hold for most of 2020, we pivoted and rallied over 600 colleagues to contribute their time and expertise to support the vulnerable population affected by social distancing, mainly through our Singtel Digital Silvers programme.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

To keep our community safe and healthy, we supported #BYOBclean in early 2020 and 2021, an initiative by Temasek Foundation to distribute free hand sanitisers to all households in Singapore. More than 120 Singtel staff volunteers supported this meaningful initiative.

The impact of the pandemic has been particularly acute for vulnerable and low-income families. Through the SG Care Community Network Outreach organised by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, our staff volunteers were involved in reaching out to these vulnerable persons in Singapore. They made phone calls to identified households and engaged residents following a call script. This included checking how they were coping and sharing where they could seek help if needed.

To keep our community safe and healthy, we supported #BYOBclean in early 2020 and 2021, an initiative by Temasek Foundation to distribute free hand sanitisers to all households in Singapore. More than 120 Singtel staff volunteers supported this meaningful initiative.

In Australia, we continue to work closely with the Australian Business and Community Network (ABCN), of which we are a founding member, to mentor vulnerable youths in high-needs schools. During the year, 124 Optus employees filled mentor roles and continued to give back through digital mentoring.

In March 2021, we extended our Optus Agile programme to ten of our charity partners including ABCN and KARI Foundation. It involved a three-day workshop to upskill their leadership teams. Our Agile coaches and Enterprise Agile Transformation Lead delivered topics such as planning, prioritisation, road mapping and creating the right mindset. 24 participants from our charity partners walked away empowered with useful tools to improve their operations and ways of working.

Mark Reeves, a Senior Manager at Optus Networks, stayed in contact with his mentee every two to three weeks through email, phone or video call to guide him in setting career goals.

# Race Against Cancer

The Singtel-Singapore Cancer Society Race Against Cancer 2020 in September aimed to raise funds for cancer patients and their families. As the title sponsor for the 12th year running, Singtel donated S$250,000 to support the Society’s Help the Children and Youth Programme that was set up to improve the lives of children affected by cancer.

We also mobilised our colleagues including the Singtel Management Committee which formed a running team to participate in the race held virtually for the first time. Together, the Singtel runners raised over S$135,000 and covered 6,810 km.

# RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES

The Singtel Group is committed to being a responsible and innovative leader in the markets where we operate. Underpinning our strategy is embracing responsible business practices across our operations and supply chain and delivering an unparalleled customer experience.

We serve more than 14 million consumer and enterprise customers to meet their daily communication and connectivity needs. We strive to preserve stakeholder trust and confidence in us. We also aim to mitigate the unintended negative impact of our products and services for our stakeholders, in particular these two areas identified as material topics for the Singtel Group: Data Privacy and Cyber Security as well as Ethical and Fair Business Practices.

# Climate Change & Environment

We can help to address the pressing needs of the environment and society as infocomm technology continues to influence the way people connect, work and play. We recognise the rising stakeholder expectations of us as the market leader to drive greater environmental and societal impact.

# Data privacy and cyber security

The Singtel Group upholds the highest standards of customer data privacy and cyber security. We advocate greater transparency on how personal data is used and safeguard our customer data in strict adherence to data protection laws, mainly PDPA in Singapore and the Privacy Act and Telecommunications Act in Australia. Singtel’s Data Protection Policy and Optus’ Privacy Policy help our customers understand how we collect, use, share and protect their personal data.

We conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests on our corporate information systems and network infrastructure to identify, reduce and rectify security weaknesses.

This is guided by our Cyber Risk Management Framework to help us manage current and emerging threats and implement risk treatment measures to protect our system data and customer information. We constantly monitor and review risks to ensure security adequacy and effectiveness in today’s rapidly evolving cyber risk landscape.

We continue to educate our staff and improve processes to reduce the recurrence of data breaches. Every year, all employees must complete a mandatory online privacy training which covers local laws and staff’s responsibility to safeguard data. They also attend data privacy and security awareness training to strengthen cyber security awareness and learn from best practices. Phishing email simulation exercise and training are conducted throughout the year to improve staff knowledge on phishing email identification. We periodically publish security tips, such as malware and ransomware, and mobile device security to raise employees’ awareness and vigilance level. Targeted training is also conducted for our customer service teams and offshore contact centres. These are supplemented by regular reminders by the leadership team on the importance of our code of conduct, data privacy and protection as well as anti-bribery and corruption.

# Figure 1: Managing Customer Data Privacy and Protection

# GOVERNANCE MANAGEMENT

- Appointed Group Chief Information Officer as our Data Protection Officer to provide management strategic oversight and direction across the Group, reporting directly to the Board Risk Committee on risks and solutions.
- Engaged employees in shared learnings through case studies to emphasise the importance of data privacy in day-to-day activities.
- Established nine security operation centres worldwide to support and advise our global enterprise customers on protecting their own and customer data.

# STAFF EDUCATION AND TRAINING

- Educate employees through annual mandatory online training and refresher programmes on data privacy and information security.
- Conduct regular phishing email simulation exercise and training to improve staff awareness and identification of phishing emails.
- Train onshore and offshore customer service teams.
- Share security tips, such as those on malware and ransomware and mobile device security through email and Espresso, our intranet.

# BUSINESS RISK ASSESSMENTS

- Carry out data protection impact assessments to identify potential data risks and develop mitigation measures.
- Conduct regular compliance checks on staff and vendors externally to ensure that all business processes adhere to the relevant data privacy and protection laws.

# CUSTOMER EMPOWERMENT

- Empower customers with the choice to opt out of mailing lists to receive promotional messages or marketing calls. In Singapore, we comply with the Spam Control Act where any promotional messages sent by us must be clearly labelled as advertisements. In Australia, we meet our obligations under the Privacy Act and Privacy Provisions of the Telecommunications Act, the Spam Act and the Do Not Call Register.

# About this Report

# Contents

In FY2021, we recorded 21 privacy incidents in Singapore, five of which were referred to us by the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). These incidents were mainly due to IT, process or human errors, resulting in personal data being disclosed to the wrong party. We terminated the service of two employees for abusing their access to customer information. One case related to a call centre employee who retrieved unauthorised customer information for a moneylender who was harassing his family. We promptly alerted the police and terminated his employment, which was in line with our zero tolerance policy against any fraud, unethical or dishonest action. The court jailed and fined him in December last year after he pleaded guilty. During the year, PDPC did not impose fines or non-monetary sanctions against Singtel.

In February 2021, we reported a data breach of information comprising personal information of about 130,000 customers, enterprises and former employees on a third-party file sharing system from Accellion. Our vendor notified us of this incident which was part of a wider global attack against their systems, whose users included banks, universities and government agencies. We immediately notified affected stakeholders, created a website with relevant information and FAQs, and appointed a global data and information service provider to provide identity monitoring services for them. We also worked closely with cyber security experts and relevant authorities including the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore on this matter.

# Climate Change & Environment

In Australia, we track customer privacy complaints that are referred to us from customers, employees, other individuals or regulatory bodies. In FY2021, there were 114 cases categorised as privacy incidents. 11 cases were referred by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) and one case from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). These incidents, such as the unauthorised disclosure of personal information, were mainly caused by staff error and negligence, and mostly affected individuals. We did not report any Notifiable Data Breaches during this period as the notification threshold to notify OAIC was not met for any of these complaints.

# People and Future of Work

# Protecting Customer from Scam Calls

In late December 2020, we launched a scam awareness and educational campaign to educate Singaporeans on how to recognise and protect themselves from scams. Titled ‘Jaga your data!’, it comprised three light-hearted short films, each playing out a typical telco-related ruse by fraudsters, infused with local humour. ‘Jaga’ is a Malay word widely used in Singapore which means take care or protect.

The campaign builds on our ongoing efforts to mitigate scams and safeguard the interests of our customers through regular scam advisory and fraud analytics to block scam calls. In April 2020, we worked with the government to add a ‘+’ prefix to international incoming calls spoofed to look like local numbers. Our customers can therefore identify these scam calls easily and remain vigilant.

# Sustainable Value Creation

Learn more about the scammers’ modus operandi at the Singtel YouTube channel: This is tech support calling.

In Australia, we blocked more than 15 million scam calls to our customers in 2020. We expect the number to increase with recently introduced The Reducing Scam Calls Code supported by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The new formal process requires joint effort and information exchange among the Australian telcos to monitor, detect, trace and block scam calls.

# Optus and Mastercard bring digital identity to the Australian telecommunications industry

In November 2020, Optus and Mastercard launched ID, a Mastercard digital identity service, to strengthen customer identity verification and authentication process while retaining a best-in-class, digital-first customer experience. The service gives customers full control over what information is shared and can only be accessed once the users verify their identity using the biometric capabilities built into their mobile devices, thus minimising SIM-related fraud such as SIM swapping.

# Trustwave Launches Powerful Cyber Security Collaboration Platform

During the year, Trustwave expanded the reach of our unique cyber security collaboration platform, which leverages sourced knowledge from a global community of organisations to help others solve pressing cyber security challenges. With Trustwave Security Colony™, enterprises can gain access to a wealth of resources such as best practices, risk assessment tools and guidance from security experts to bolster their security posture.

# Ethical and fair business practices

Ethical and fair business practices are critical to building trust and loyalty with our customers. They are also manifested in two of our Singtel Group’s core values – Integrity and Personal Excellence – which we expect employees to embrace and demonstrate in every aspect of their work.

As a responsible company, we incorporate these values into our processes and decision making to ensure that everyone behaves responsibly and ethically. In this report, we focus on fair marketing communications, anti-bribery and corruption, and tax transparency.

# Fair marketing communications

During the year, the Advertising Standards Authority of Singapore (ASAS) raised two cases from customers who felt that our advertised promotions were not clear or could be misleading. We amended the text of our mobile advertisement in question for clarity. The other case involved our fibre broadband service and ASAS reminded us that pertinent conditions should be stated on our ads before consumers access the online sign-up page, which spelt out all the conditions.

In Australia, no fines were imposed on Optus.

# Anti-bribery and corruption

The Singtel Group adopts a zero tolerance policy towards fraud, corruption and unethical actions of any form. We manage our exposure to corruption risks through good corporate governance and apply robust internal controls. Our management of fraud risk is supported by various policies and programmes. For example, our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, together with our Codes of Conduct in place at all Group entities, mandates that Singtel Board members, management, employees and third parties who represent us, such as suppliers, contractors and business partners, observe our approach to bribery and corruption. Our Whistleblower Programme, comprising an independent whistleblower hotline operated by external service providers in Singapore and Australia and supported by our Fraud Investigation Policy, strengthens our internal control environment. Please refer to our website for more information on Corporate Governance.

Every year, all employees undergo mandatory online refresher courses on Code of Conduct, Fraud Awareness and Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy. We review these courses periodically to ensure that the content remains up to date.

If an allegation of corrupt conduct is received, the Internal Audit department or teams led by subject matter experts will conduct an investigation. If an alleged incident involving corrupt or fraudulent conduct by an employee is substantiated, we will terminate the employee’s employment and report the matter to the relevant law enforcement authority.

During the year, we received 121 cases via our whistleblower channels regarding various allegations, including employee misconduct. We also received 60 cases of allegations of fraud and corruption by Singtel Group employees or representatives via other channels, such as compliance checks and investigations by law enforcement agencies. In total, 74 cases were found to be substantiated, while another 74 were not. 33 cases remained under investigation as at 31 March 2021. In addition, we closed 33 matters received in the prior year that were still under investigation as at 31 March 2020, of which 21 cases were substantiated. Six of the 95 substantiated cases took place outside Singapore and Australia.

# Responsible Tax Management

We recognise that our tax contributions are important to public finances and the social programmes they fund, and the Singtel Group is committed to complying with applicable tax laws of the jurisdictions where we operate.

The Board is responsible for risk governance and assisted by the Audit Committee in the oversight of tax matters. As part of our continuous effort and commitment towards sound tax governance, we established a Tax Risk Management Framework during the year that formalised our tax risk management practices. The framework sets a coordinated approach in our identification, management and mitigation of tax risks and promotes responsible tax management. The Group Chief Financial Officer, under the appointment by the Audit Committee and supported by Vice President of Group Tax, supervises the framework practices and effectiveness. For more information, please refer to our Responsible Tax Management Statement.

Optus is categorised as a Key Taxpayer for income tax by the Australian Tax Office and is subject to its annual Pre-lodgement Compliance Review. Optus is a signatory to the Board of Taxation’s voluntary tax transparency code, publishing Tax Transparency Reports since 2018. The latest Optus 2020 Tax Transparency Report outlines tax policy, strategy and governance for our Australian operations. It also highlights our Australian contribution to corporate income tax, effective tax rate and reconciliations of accounting profit to income tax expense and tax payable.

# CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

We are committed to anticipating and meeting the needs of our consumer and enterprise customers. Our customer strategy is underpinned by digital innovation to deliver high quality services and unparalleled customer experience.

# Customer satisfaction

We strive to deliver a superior customer experience by focusing on innovation, the quality of our products and services, and customer care. We continue to lead in customer experience and maintain our market leadership position. As of March 2021, we were leading the market with our Net Promoter Score in Singapore.

We aim to deepen the engagement and relationship with our customers in this highly competitive market. We are also committed to offering them a great network and service experience. Hence we continuously enhance the reach, reliability and quality of our networks in Singapore and Australia.

We have in the past few years changed the way we engage and serve customers as they adopt a digital lifestyle. We have invested in digitisation efforts across our retail experience, operations and call centres to improve customer experience while increasing productivity.

By using technologies such as visual virtual and live chat agents, customers no longer need to spend time waiting to talk to call centre agents.

During the year, we paid a S$36,000 fine imposed by IMDA for a service disruption in August 2019 that affected 262,408 fixed lines. Optus did not receive any fines from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) or ACMA. However, we were subjected to two non-monetary sanctions from ACMA during the year: a formal warning on how we consult on network deployment and an Enforceable Undertaking regarding breaches of consumer protection rules about how our customers migrate to the National Broadband Network (NBN).

We agreed to report quarterly to the ACMA for 12 months on our compliance under the Enforceable Undertaking and have reviewed our network deployment consultation processes and undertaken training with our consultants who carry out these public consultations on our behalf.

There was no non-monetary sanction and legal action regarding anti-competitive behaviour or violation of anti-trust legislation against the Singtel Group.

# Optus’ Customer Experience Reinvented

In December 2020, Optus transformed the customer service space by introducing a ‘Community of Experts’ programme, where every customer will be moved into his or her own dedicated team by the first half of 2021. The Community of Experts is a multi-disciplinary team centred around collaborating and solving customer needs with the aim of eliminating transfers to different departments for resolution.

This industry-changing move means customers will always return to the same team – their Community of Experts – regardless of their requests, including reviewing their mobile contracts and getting information about products. The team will also offer personalised responses based on customers’ needs and challenges, such as network performance and outages. The service is available round-the-clock via messaging or calls. This removes friction points and creates a more efficient and seamless customer experience.

# UNBOXED Lite 5G Experience Zones

In January 2021, we gave our iconic public payphone booths on Orchard Road a new lease of life with 5G connectivity. The booths, which have been around since 1994, have been transformed into next-generation multimedia kiosks equipped with 5G connectivity.

Named UNBOXED Lite, the kiosks are Singapore’s first 5G experience zones and provide round-the-clock access to a wide range of services.

Anyone with a smartphone can tap on free 5G-powered WiFi to get a taste of Singtel’s ultra-fast 5G speeds and smooth streaming of exclusive 4K content from our pay TV channel partner Love Nature. In a nostalgic move to offer a payphone experience of yesteryear, UNBOXED Lite offers free 3-minute local calls to all visitors. To provide a safe and healthy environment for users, all touch surfaces are disinfected frequently and coated with a long-lasting anti-microbial solution.

The Singtel Group intends to leverage 5G as a catalyst to unlock business opportunities and societal benefits across Singapore and Australia and advance both countries’ digital economy. This builds on the momentum of our earlier 5G trials with partners like the Port of Singapore Authority to realise 5G benefits in actual use cases.

# Raising community’s 5G awareness

In Singapore, we installed 5G in UNBOXED, Singtel’s 24/7 unmanned 5G-powered retail store, to let visitors witness first-hand the enhanced customer experience with 5G hyper-connectivity. Customers can also experience seamless delivery service through connected self-serve kiosks and receive real-time in-store analytics enabled by artificial intelligence from UNBOXED’s roving smart robot ambassador Stanley and 5G virtual assistant Stella. UNBOXED won the Outstanding Store Design award at the World Retail Awards 2020.

We also rolled out UNBOXED Lite 5G experience zones across the island by creating multimedia kiosks that provide consumers with round-the-clock access to complimentary 5G-powered WiFi via their smartphones (see boxed story).

# Enabling 5G industry application

We will expand our 5G ecosystems in Singapore and Australia by enabling enterprises and start-ups to develop low latency 5G solutions on our Multi-access Edge Compute (MEC) infrastructure. MEC, leveraging the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Outposts, will enable 5G solutions like robotics, drones, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence to operate at ultra-low latency, closer to the end-users. Our 5G ecosystem of partners, including global cloud providers, technology providers, device manufacturers and apps developers, provides an essential one-stop hub for 5G and edge computing needs of enterprises and start-ups.

During the year, we launched the National Industry Innovation Network (NIIN) – an alliance between technology giant Cisco and universities, La Trobe and Curtin – to improve Australia’s long-term digital economic resilience by accelerating digital transformation. A white paper will be developed on the role of collaborative technology in remote working, focusing on government, healthcare and education sectors, to better analyse the adoption and application of 5G technologies in different use cases.

We also partnered University of South Australia and James Cook University to identify 5G opportunities to better address real-world industry challenges. Together with Curtin University, we are building an on-campus 5G lab for research, teaching and learning, and exploring applications that will benefit industries and the Australian economy.

# Sustainable Value Creation

# Upholding human rights

We are committed to upholding and protecting the human rights of all individuals through a culture of trust, respect and inclusion in our company, supply chains and the communities where we operate, regardless of backgrounds, beliefs and abilities.

As a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2007, we conduct business in line with its Ten Principles and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We are also guided by international human rights principles as set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This applies to how we operate and shape our approach to human rights.

With the Modern Slavery Act passed in Australia in late 2018 and enforced in January 2019, we published Optus’ first Human Rights and Modern Slavery Statements during the year. The Statements provide an overview of our approach to human rights, the standards we set for ourselves and people who work for us and on our behalf.

We will review the statements annually to continuously improve our approach to human rights and modern slavery. We strive to contribute positively and ensure that human rights are understood, observed and respected as far as is reasonably practical.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021

We have also rolled out Modern Slavery training modules for staff to increase their awareness of the role we and our suppliers play to reduce this risk in our supply chain.

# Sustainable supply chain management

The Singtel Group has an extensive supply chain ranging from mobile and network equipment, and infrastructure suppliers to content providers, security and managing agents. In FY2021, they represented 5,163 suppliers globally, down from 6,469 from last year due to COVID-19 business expenditure impact and ongoing efforts to consolidate our supplier base. With the wide geography and complex nature of our supply chain, we believe that collaboration with socially and environmentally conscious suppliers will help us mitigate a significant proportion of our sustainability risks.

All new suppliers are assessed against ESG criteria through our sustainability questionnaire as part of their onboarding tender process. This is applied to tenders above $200,000 across the Singtel Group. 100% of such new suppliers were assessed against the criteria during the year.

# Supplier sustainability assessment

During the year, we also conducted a sustainability and organisational life cycle assessment on our supply chain to identify direct and indirect environment and social impact and risks across our business operations and value chain. As part of this exercise, we reviewed the ESG commitment of our top 100 suppliers, who constituted 65% of our procurement spend.

We analysed their processes and policies as well as products and services provided to us. We identified high impact areas of improvement and where we can influence positive change both environmentally and socially. The assessment adopted a similar methodology to an organisational life cycle assessment to reflect the multi-dimensional impact of our business covering Group Consumer, Group Enterprise, NCS and corporate functions. This is part of our aim to deliver greater outcomes for our business and society through our supply chain.

# In-depth Environmental and Social Assessment

# A) Identifying key suppliers

We used our total spend with suppliers to determine material suppliers whom we engaged. Our top 100 suppliers list was narrowed down to 38 suppliers who provided our top three material product groups: mobile handsets, network equipment and IT hardware/software.

We landed on 20 distinct suppliers representing 46% of our total procurement spend. This comprised mostly of suppliers for handsets, our most material product group, covering almost 30% of our spend with suppliers.

# B) Assessing suppliers’ environmental and social focus areas

We assessed these 20 suppliers on how they managed their environmental and social impact in their operations and supply chain, and whether they set targets aligned with the Singtel Group (see table 3).

We also analysed industry and international standards, desktop research and reports, as well as environmental and social actions and policies in the telecommunications sector. In addition, we reviewed how our industry peers were managing their suppliers in these aspects.

Third-party sustainability risk assessments of current suppliers

Earlier in the year, we concluded a sustainability risk assessment of our active suppliers using a framework we developed with supply chain expert ELEVATE.

Suppliers were assessed according to inherent geographic and product risks and those identified completed a Sustainability Self-Assessment Questionnaire on the controls they have in place in the following areas: corporate governance, diversity, human rights, labour rights and anti-modern slavery, work health and safety, environmental and energy management, and conflict minerals.

# Next steps

Next year, we plan to implement tailored intervention programmes based on these results to support identified suppliers in integrating sustainability-related practices.

# Workplace Safety and Health

Workplace safety and health (WSH) is our top priority and we strive to inculcate good safety habits and practices in our employees, suppliers and contractors to ensure that work activities are carried out safely.

We engage only qualified contractors that meet stringent safety requirements during the tender process. We also work closely with appointed contractors to maintain high safety and health standards, including regular dialogue on best safety practices and feedback on their performance.

During the year, Singtel and Optus successfully attained the ISO 45001 certification, a new international ISO standard that provides the framework for organisations to improve workers’ health and safety, reduce risks, and create safer working conditions.

# Singtel Safe Contractor Accreditation (SCA) Scheme

We introduced SCA scheme in 2016, a set of Singtel’s WSH standards for contractors who perform high-risk technical or physical work to mitigate safety risks. During the year, 77 accredited contractors successfully maintained the validity of their accreditation. Those who failed were barred from future contracts with Singtel. The drop in number was mainly due to contractors not having any work with us or expired contracts.

# Critical Permit to Work system

Through the Critical Permit to Work system, we adopt stringent safety checks and site enforcement in areas of high-risk work such as confined space and work at height in our Singapore operations. No incident was reported during the year.

# Australian Standard for Safety Management

We ensure continued certification of AS4801, the Australian Standard for Safety Management, for our operations in Australia to meet a high standard of safety management system.

# Critical Incident Hotline

We established a Workplace Health and Safety Critical Incident Hotline to report critical incidents immediately in Australia. During the year, there were 11 cases of incidents reported.

Note: Singtel Group sustainability performance data includes sustainability data of Optus which is Singtel’s subsidiary in Australia.

# Reporting criteria

As a basis for the assurance engagement, we have used the criterion of “Accuracy” as defined by GRI and specific criteria determined by Singtel Group as being relevant for its sustainability performance. We consider these reporting criteria to be relevant and appropriate to review the Sustainability Report. Such Criteria were specifically designed for sustainability performance; as a result, the subject matter may not be suitable for another purpose.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ responsibility

The Management is responsible for the preparation of the Subject Matters in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the company’s sustainability reporting. The Management is responsible for the collection and presentation of the information and for maintaining adequate records and internal controls that are designed to support the sustainability reporting process.

For the purpose of the Sustainability Report 2021, there are no legally prescribed requirements relating to the verification of sustainability reports.

# Auditor’s responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matters based on the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’) and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with Singtel Group on 1 April 2020. Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.

The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusions.

Our review was limited to the information on the select indicators set out within the Report from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 and our responsibility does not include:

- Any work in respect of sustainability information published elsewhere in Singtel Group’s annual report, website and other publications,
- Sustainability information prior to 1 April 2020 and subsequent to 31 March 2021, and
- Management’s forward-looking statements such as targets, plans and intentions.

# Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our firm applies Singapore Standards on Quality Control 1 of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We have the required competencies and experience to conduct this assurance engagement. Our professionals have both the required assurance skills and experience in the applicable Subject Matters including environmental, social and financial aspects.

# Description of procedures performed

Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.

Although we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Subject Matters and related information, and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.

# About this Report
