# Investing In Technology & Innovation

Captii invests in technology and innovation. In 2018 we invested in 2 new start-ups from Singapore and Malaysia, bringing our investees in the venture investment portfolio to a total of 15 companies from 6 countries. Some of our investees are global enterprises with customers from all over the world. A number are regional players in South East Asia and the rest firmly focused on winning in their large home markets of Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

Our venture investment portfolio has grown significantly from when we first started out in 2015. By the end of 2018 our portfolio was fair-valued at S$11.2 million versus investment cost of S$7.7 million. The companies we have invested in are engaged in a variety of businesses but the portfolio has a strong bias towards fintech and B2B ventures. More than three-quarters of our investees are fintech or enterprise-application start-ups.

One fintech start-up in the portfolio is entirely home-grown. PostPay evolved from our Unifiedcomms business over the past 4 years. This business has shown promising growth in terms of revenue and also technology. We are hopeful that it is the first of many home-grown start-ups to develop from within our group.

# Annual Report 2018

# Executive Chairman’s Letter

Dear Captii Shareholder:

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present the Annual Report of Captii Limited for the financial year ended 31 December 2018.

# A broadly positive year

Our Group entered 2018 on a strong footing having maintained profitability for ten consecutive years.

Both our GlobeOSS and Unifiedcomms businesses generated higher revenue this year. GlobeOSS posted revenue of S$19.7 million, an increase of 50.3% from the S$13.1 million recorded in 2017. Unifiedcomms revenue marginally increased by 0.7% to S$11.8 million in 2018 compared to the S$11.7 million achieved the year before.

The significantly higher revenue delivered by GlobeOSS was the main driver for the S$6.7 million improvement in overall Group revenue for the year to S$31.5 million.

# Investing in technology and innovation

At the start of 2018, we continued to have adequate cash balances to continue with the strategy of augmenting organic growth with growth by strategic investment. The Captii Ventures team identified and screened many candidates for investment throughout 2018. During the year, Captii Ventures completed two further investments in early stage start-ups to bring the number of investees in the portfolio to fifteen in total. The work to identify, screen and engage on further investment opportunities will persist in the new year.

# Balance sheet strength and dividends

Apart from the further investments made by Captii Ventures in 2018, during the year we continued to reinvest in GlobeOSS and Unifiedcomms – especially for the PostPay business – for further product development as well for the acquisition of assets to support the fulfilment of managed service contracts. We continue to have a strong balance sheet at year-end 2018 with ample cash and cash equivalents of S$8.7 million. This was also after declaring and paying to shareholders a dividend for the ninth year running. We had on 18 September 2018, paid a tax-exempt interim dividend of 1.25 Singapore Cents per share. In light of the anticipated capital requirements of our Group’s growth and investment-driven development strategy, no further and final dividend payment has been recommended by our Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2018.

# In gratitude

Our overall bottom-line for the year was positive at S$3.4 million, a 47.1% improvement on the S$2.3 million recorded last year.

2018 represented our tenth consecutive year of profitability. Profitability in 2018 had improved compared to 2017 - our Group’s return on equity (ROE) increased to 6.2% this year from 3.2% the year before. This improvement in our ROE performance is in large part attributable to a non-cash, fair value gain on investment that we enjoyed on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio.

# Higher system sale contract and managed service contract performance this year

Efforts to grow the managed service business persisted in 2018 and the results are encouraging. Revenues from this contract type improved by S$1.1 million against last year with the increase being attributable to the higher managed service contract revenues at GlobeOSS. The revitalised unit within the Unifiedcomms business, PostPay that focuses on amongst others, prepaid credit solutions on a managed service model, achieved further growth this year. PostPay revenues grew in 2018 to countervail any decline or slow growth in the other managed service contracts in the Unifiedcomms portfolio.

2018 proved to be a broadly positive year for our Group. We ended the year with improved revenue and operating profit results courtesy of a strong year at GlobeOSS and encouraging progress in the venture investment activities at Captii Ventures.

We look forward to doing better in the year ahead and will strive to deliver an improvement in Group financial performance for 2019.

For the year that was, I extend my deepest gratitude to the talented and dedicated individuals across all the businesses that make up our Group, for your commitment and perseverance. I ask the same from you again in the new financial year ahead, to move our business onward and upward. To you, our shareholder, I thank you for your continued belief and patience in our people and our business. Last but certainly not least, my thanks go to the government agencies and regulatory bodies for their guidance and support.

# Annual Report 2018

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# An overview of our business

Our Group comprises three main segments: Unifiedcomms, GlobeOSS and Captii Ventures.

Throughout 2018, Unifiedcomms continued to address mobile network operators and integrated telecoms service providers with application and platform software, turnkey solutions and systems and a variety of professional and managed services. In 2016 a unit within Unifiedcomms called (formerly Mobilization) was revitalised into a fresh start-up and given prominence as part of a wider reorganisation of the Unifiedcomms business. PostPay now focuses mainly on providing advanced solutions for prepaid credit on a managed service model.

GlobeOSS meanwhile, continued to grow from strength to strength into Malaysia’s leading systems integration solution provider in the telecoms big data and analytics field. Unifiedcomms operates primarily in the telecoms-tech markets of three regions: South East Asia (SEA), South Asia (SA) and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) while GlobeOSS focuses exclusively on SEA. For Unifiedcomms, with the exception of Malaysia, Singapore and Pakistan, where engagement with the customer is conducted directly by our own personnel, the majority of our engagements with customers are carried out through various sales channel partners. This two-tier sales and distribution approach enables us to cost-effectively reach customers within each region of focus and to tap into the local knowledge and insights of our partners to build and deliver compelling solutions.

Captii Ventures, the venture investment arm of our Group, focuses primarily on the SEA market for start-up investment opportunities. Our venture investment business regularly interacts with other venture capital (VC) management companies in the region and participates in funding rounds as either lead investor or as a co-investor following the lead investor. In 2018 Captii Ventures added two new investees to its portfolio of start-up investments while also supporting the thirteen existing investees from 2017 in realising the development plans for their business.

As at end-2018, there are a total of 189 people that are employed in our Group. The majority of these personnel are located in Malaysia, where our operational headquarters is situated, while the rest work out of Singapore, Pakistan, Brunei, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.

The 2018 financial was a positive year for our business in terms of Group revenue growth but a mixed one when we examine the performance of each of our business segments. The Group achieved consolidated revenue of S$31.5 million for the financial year 2018, an increase of 26.9% as compared to the S$24.8 million recorded in the previous year.

GlobeOSS posted revenue of S$19.7 million in 2018, an increase of 50.3% from the S$13.1 million recorded in 2017. Unifiedcomms recorded a slight increase of 0.7% in revenue, turning in total revenue of S$11.8 million in 2018 versus S$11.7 million the year before.

GlobeOSS delivered an improvement in both system sale and managed service contract revenues in 2018. System sales increased significantly by 53.1%, from S$10.4 million in 2017 to S$15.9 million in 2018, while managed service revenue increased by 39.6%, from S$2.7 million in 2017 to S$3.8 million in 2018.

GlobeOSS continues to have both its system sale and managed service business concentrated in the SEA region. The S$6.6 million increase in revenue from the SEA region is driven by the S$5.5 million increase in system sales and a S$1.1 million improvement in managed service revenues between 2017 and 2018.

In 2018, SEA, our Group’s home region, continues to be the largest geographic source of revenue, accounting for 96.5% of Group revenue.

Higher gross profit achieved, in line with higher revenue. In line with the higher consolidated revenue of S$31.5 million for 2018, a 26.9% gain on 2017 revenue, absolute gross profit achieved for the year was higher compared to 2017.

Group gross profit for 2018 was S$12.0 million, up by S$0.7 million or 5.7% against what was recorded in 2017. Gross profit grew slower than revenue due to the sales mix achieved in 2018 – where the typically lower gross profit margin GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues accounted for the majority of the improvement in Group revenue. This, by extension, acted to reduce the overall gross profit margin earned on Group consolidated revenue to 38.1% as compared to 45.7% achieved the year before.

# Growth in both system sale and managed service revenues

The increase in Group revenue this year against last year is mainly attributable to the 48.1% or S$5.5 million significant increase in GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues.

# Revenue by Type of Contract (S$000)

System sale contract average gross profit margin declined markedly to 25.2% in 2018, primarily due to the higher contribution of GlobeOSS to system sale contract revenues of the Group as compared to 2017. Gross profit margin earned on managed service contract revenues was relatively flat, showing only a gentler decline from 54.5% in 2017 to 53.5% this year. This decrease was mainly attributable to higher third-party costs on certain managed service contracts.

|System Sales|11,541|17,091|

| |2017|2018|
|---|---|---|
|System Sales|35.6%|25.2%|
|Managed Services|54.5%|53.5%|

We expected 2018 to be a challenging year for Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS on the system sale front. However contrary to earlier expectations, market conditions improved in the second half of the year for the GlobeOSS business. Coupled with improved success rates for sale opportunities, significant growth in GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues was delivered in the second half of the year.

SEA once again served as the principal driver for the 2018 improvement in Group revenue for the year, growing by 28.9% or S$6.8 million against last year’s contribution. The regions that turned in a disappointing performance were SA and MEA.

# Annual Report 2018

# Management Discussion and Analysis

System sale contract revenues grew significantly this year, which resulted in managed service contract revenues contributing to less than half of Group revenue. This year managed service contract revenues accounted for 45.7% of Group revenue, down from 53.5% in 2017.

2018 marks our tenth consecutive year of being in the black. Group net profit for the year, at S$3.4 million, is 47.1% higher than the S$2.3 million recorded in 2017. This increase in our Group’s bottom line reflects the fair value gain on investment that we enjoyed on the revaluation of Captii Ventures investment portfolio. This fair value gain amounting to S$0.9 million had no cash impact on our business.

Our Group’s operating expenditure for the year increased to S$9.4 million as compared to S$8.7 million in 2017.

In 2017, we had a fair value loss assessed on our Group’s venture investment portfolio and a foreign exchange loss due to the unfavourable exchange rate movement of US Dollar, Malaysia Ringgit and Pakistan Rupee against the Singapore Dollar. The fair value loss, which is unrealised, was a result of the lower estimated fair valuation of the venture investment portfolio following the adoption of the most appropriate valuation technique.

This year we had a foreign exchange loss due to unfavourable exchange rate movement of Pakistan Rupee against the Singapore Dollar, and impairment loss on goodwill and investment property to take into our income statement. The impairment on goodwill this year relates to the acquisition of Ahead Mobile Sdn Bhd, which is now believed to produce lower than expected profitability and returns. The impairment loss on investment property meanwhile had arisen following an open market valuation of the property at end-2018.

|Profit for the Year|6,459|3,002|3,384|2,255|2,300|

Excluding the effect of exceptional items such as the impairment loss this year, our opex for 2018 was slightly higher at S$8.5 million compared to S$8.4 million for 2017.

The flow-down effect of the improvement in Group net profit before and after exceptional items and fair value movements is clearly reflected in our EBITDA results for the year.

# Annual Report 2018

# Management Discussion and Analysis

|EBITDA (S$’000)|Shareholders Equity (S$000)|Return on Equity (%)|
|---|---|---|
|8,287|39,026|15.7%|
|5,021|35,884|3.2%|
|4,615|37,055|6.2%|

|2015|2015| |
|2016|2016| |
|2017|2017| |
|2018|2018| |

EBITDA rose to S$4.6 million in 2018, an increase of 24.4%, in tandem with the 47.1% increase in net profit. A significant proportion of this EBITDA improvement is accounted for by the impact on Group net profit of the fair value gain on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio. Removing the effect of this significant non-cash item in 2018, and also excluding exceptional items for the year, the cash generation performance at our underlying business can be identified. EBITDA before exceptional items and fair value gain stood at S$4.6 million for 2018 – a 12.9% improvement against what was recorded in 2017.

This year the contribution of system sale contracts was considerably higher, arising from significant growth in revenue performance of GlobeOSS. Managed service contracts showed steady revenue growth across GlobeOSS and PostPay. With the performance of our businesses being maintained if not improved further in 2019, we are optimistic of further extending our dividend payout track record – to at minimum, maintain the dividend per share that was paid to all shareholders last year.

# Investing in (external) technology and innovation

As at end-2018, we continued to have more than sufficient capital to augment our organic growth plans with growth by strategic investment. This remains an essential element of our current business plan that targets sustained, double-digit Group profit growth and a significant uplift of our ROE performance.

Throughout 2018, our venture investment business persisted in identifying and evaluating many investment opportunities in the SEA region. As a direct result of these efforts by the Captii Ventures team, as at end-2018, we have a total of fifteen investments in new technology ventures and start-ups. Out of these fifteen investments, two were made during the year.

# Reviewing our 2018 balance sheet positions

Because of the higher net profit delivered in 2018, our Group’s return on equity (ROE) for the year improved to 6.2% from the 3.2% recorded in 2017. Another year with single-digit outcome is certainly a disappointing result, even in the context of an improvement of ROE compared to previous year. Of course the positive outcome of 2016 was aided by the outsized contribution from the significant fair value gain on the venture investment portfolio that year. Without the benefit of this gain from our venture investment portfolio our Group would have had a much lower ROE for 2016.

Now to turn to our Group’s balance sheet as at the end of the 2018 financial year: we ended 2018 with higher current assets of S$28.1 million, as compared to S$27.8 million as at end-2017. This is mainly attributable to the increase in Group cash and cash equivalents as a result of collection received in 2018 relating to trade receivables and other assets from late 2017, and proceeds from disposal of one of the venture investments and borrowings. This improvement in cash and cash equivalents was partly offset by higher investment in an associate and other financial assets (classified under non-current assets) totalling S$1.6 million in cash being utilised during the year on investments made by Captii Ventures. After these investments, Group cash and cash equivalents as at end-2018 was S$8.7 million as compared to S$7.4 million as at end-2017.

# Annual Report 2018

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# Cash and Cash Equivalents (S$000)

|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|13,450|11,880|9,055|8,686|7,391|

Our total non-current assets increased from S$26.2 million as at 31 December 2017 to S$27.7 million as at 31 December 2018. This increase was mainly due to the increase in investments by Captii Ventures which are classified as other financial assets. This increase was however partly offset by the impairment loss on goodwill (classified as intangible assets) in connection with the acquisition of Ahead Mobile Sdn Bhd.

Total liabilities of our Group as at 31 December 2018 decreased from S$13.8 million to S$12.6 million. This decrease was mainly due to the reduction in trade and other payables, following repayment made accordingly to the vendors.

# Reviewing movements in Group cash

Our Group’s net cash flows generated from operations for 2018 was S$2.8 million, a decrease of 26.9% as compared to the net cash flows generated from operations of S$3.8 million in the previous year. This decrease is mainly attributable to higher working capital incurred of S$1.7 million for 2018, as compared to S$0.2 million for 2017. The higher working capital incurred this year was mainly caused by higher repayment to trade payables in 2018 as compared to 2017.

Our Group’s net cash used in investing activities for 2018 amounted to S$1.8 million, a decrease of 53.2% as compared to the S$3.8 million invested in the previous year. The lower net cash used in investing activities this year is attributable to lower volume of venture investments and investment in plant and equipment.

The Group’s net cash flow from financing activities for 2018 was S$0.9 million, in contrast with the net cash flow used in financing activities of S$2.4 million for 2017. This increase was mainly due to proceeds from borrowings and lower dividend payout for the year.

Increase in system sale contract revenues to complement more steady growth in managed service contract revenues, in spite of the competitive operating environment. Several hard-fought and won system sale contract opportunities during the year resulted in the significant revenue growth achieved by this business segment for the third consecutive year. However, this improvement in revenue performance came at the expense of thinning margins. Unifiedcomms meanwhile managed to maintain managed service contract revenues with 2017 levels, courtesy largely of the continue good progress achieved by PostPay business.

Although the growth in system sale business of GlobeOSS in 2018 had significantly augmented the slower than desired growth of our Group’s managed service contract portfolio, uncertainty and hence lumpiness is still to be expected in the contribution of system sale contracts to our Group’s future results. The need for our Group to continue to strengthen our managed service contract portfolio and to continue to grow our venture investment portfolio as the basis for delivering steady, if not rapid yet sustainable future growth, remains.

# Challenges and opportunities in 2019 and beyond

Apart from the contribution of existing long-standing managed service contracts, the bulk of the system sale revenues that are expected to be realised by our businesses in 2019 are expected to be driven by new solution implementation for new and existing customers, as well as solution enhancement, system upgrade and system capacity expansion activities of existing customers within the SEA region. This same region is also expected to drive managed service contract revenue growth.

Our Group’s managed service contract portfolio continues to have emphasis in our Group’s 2019 business plan. Group and business-segment level management will continue to work on means to better manage execution risk in respect of our strategies and tactics to grow. This includes maintaining if not growing the more mature managed service contracts in our portfolio and to more quickly translate secured contracts into substantial sources of recurrent revenue for our Group.

The growing interest and opportunity in internet-driven application services for enterprises, fintech as well as internet and handset-app delivered digital media will guide our Group’s venture investment activities.

The Group’s venture investment plan in the year ahead will continue to focus primarily on these growth businesses in the SEA region and will complement the organic growth strategy in place for our Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS businesses.

# 2018: an improvement on 2017 but below expectations

We expected system sale market conditions to continue to be somewhat challenging for our Group in 2018 and for our managed service contract portfolio to deliver growth. However yet again this year, GlobeOSS managed to secure a substantial

In FY2018, a robust process was undertaken to identify and prioritise the Group’s material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors. The process was supported by an independent consultant and involved stakeholder consultations, workshops for senior management, an assessment of long-term global trends and an internal review of our businesses.

Through internal discussion and review with the independent consultant, Management have reviewed stakeholders across the Group’s value chain and identified three (3) key stakeholder groups. These are stakeholders defined as having the most influence over and the highest level of interest in the Company’s operations as set out in Exhibit 2.

# EXHIBIT 2. KEY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS

|Employees|Customers|Suppliers|

Engagement with customers allows us to receive timely, valuable feedback to improve our service standards.|We engage suppliers to ensure alignment, especially in the areas of safety, our practices and code of conduct.|

The Group’s ESG factors are identified as those that are ranked as high and medium on the materiality matrix (See Exhibit 3). Management will focus sustainability efforts and reporting on these factors that are of the greatest concern to our business and key stakeholder groups.

As the Executive Chairman is part of the management team, the Board has reviewed the percentage of Independent Directors on the Board, the Board believes that the Executive Chairman has always acted and will continue to act at all times in the best interest of shareholders as a whole and will strive to protect and enhance the long-term shareholder values and the financial performance of the Group. The Board is in the process of identifying suitable candidates to comply with the guideline stated in the Code which requires Independent Directors to make up at least half of the Board.

The criterion for independence is based on the guidelines stated in the Code. The Board considers an “Independent” director as one who has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its 10% shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgment with a view to the best interests of the Company.

# Annual Report 2018

# Captii Limited

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The independence of the Independent Director is subject to the NC’s annual review, based on the guidelines stated in the Code, in particular the rigorous review on the continued independence of Independent Directors who have served for more than nine (9) years from the date of their first appointment.

1. Exercising control over quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information between management and the Board;
2. Ensuring compliance with the Company’s guidelines on corporate governance; and

In respect of each of the two (2) Independent Directors, namely Phuah Peng Hock and Chuah Seong Phaik having served more than nine (9) years, the Board has considered specifically their length of service and their continued independence. The Board determined that the Independent Directors remained independent in character and judgment, and that there were no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director’s judgment. The Board is of the opinion that their length of service has not, in anyway, affected their independence.

Referring to all other directors who have served beyond nine (9) years, the Board does not consider the requirement of their retirement (if any) to be in the best interests of the Company.

The Board is able to exercise objective judgment independently from management and no individual or small group of individuals dominate the decisions of the Board. The Board is of the opinion that, given the scope and nature of the Group’s operations, the present size of the Board is appropriate for effective decision making. The Board is made up of directors of both gender and who are qualified and experienced in various fields including sales, engineering, business administration, general management, accountancy and finance.

The Non-Executive and Independent Directors are involved in reviewing the corporate strategies, business operations and practices of the Group, and are also involved in reviewing and monitoring the performance of management in achieving agreed goals and objectives.

Where necessary, the Non-Executive and Independent Directors meet without the presence of Executive Directors or management.

# Principle 3: Chairman and Executive Director

Wong Tze Leng (“Tze Leng”) is the Executive Chairman of the Board and Anton Syazi Ahmad Sebi (“Anton”) is the Executive Director of the Company. They are not related to each other. The Board having considered the number of Non-Executive and Independent Directors on the Board, as well as the size and scope of the affairs and operations of the Group, is of the view that its current structure has a strong independent element which enables the independent exercise of objective judgment on corporate affairs of the Group. This is reinforced by the establishment of the various Committees of which both Tze Leng and Anton are not members.

As the Chairman of the Board, Tze Leng is responsible for providing leadership to the Board and ensuring that the Board functions effectively. He is also responsible for, among others;

# Principle 4: Board Membership

(d) The appointment and re-appointment of directors.

# 2. To determine annually whether a director is independent;

# 3. To decide whether or not each director is able to and has adequately carried out his duties as a director of the Company in particular where the director concerned has multiple board representations;

# 4. To decide on how the Board’s performance may be evaluated and propose objective performance criteria to the Board; and

# 5. To assess the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the contributions by each individual director to the effectiveness of the Board.

The role of the NC is to oversee the selection, appointment, re-appointment and induction process for directors. Candidates are selected for their character, judgment and business acumen. New directors will be appointed based on NC’s recommendations.

Where a vacancy arises under any circumstances, or where it is considered that the Board would benefit from the services of a new director, the NC, in consultation with the Board, will review the composition of the Board, including the mix of expertise, skills and attributes of existing directors, so as to identify needed and/or desired competencies to supplement the Board’s existing attributes. Where it deems necessary or appropriate, the NC may seek assistance from external search consultants for the selection of potential candidates. After the NC Chairman, the Chairman of the Board and the other NC members have interviewed the candidates, the candidates are shortlisted for the NC’s formal consideration for appointment to the Board.

The NC has adopted guidelines for annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of the contribution of each individual director to the effectiveness of the Board and has performed the necessary assessment for the financial year.

As part of the process, the directors will complete appraisal forms which are then collated by the Company Secretary who will submit to the Chairman of the NC in the form of a summary report. The summary report will be discussed during the NC meeting with a view to implementing recommendations to further enhance the effectiveness of the Board.

Where a director has multiple board representations, the NC will evaluate whether or not a director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his or her duties as director of the Group. The maximum number of listed company representations which any director may hold is set to be not more than five (5). Currently there is no alternate director appointed to the Board.

The profile that comprises key information of each of the directors is provided in page 15 to 16 of this Annual Report.

The independence of each director is reviewed annually by the NC based on the Code’s definition of what constitutes an Independent Director. Based on this review, the NC confirms the independence of the directors concerned.

The NC has reviewed the training needs for the directors in 2018 and encouraged directors to attend the relevant training courses that could enhance their knowledge to perform their duties as directors of the Company.

Pursuant to the Company’s Constitution: Individual evaluation aims to assess whether each director continues to contribute effectively and demonstrate commitment to the role. The Chairman should act on the results of the performance evaluation, and in consultation with the NC, propose, where appropriate, new members to be appointed to the Board or seek the resignation of directors.

The NC has reviewed the overall performance of the Board in terms of its role and responsibilities and the conduct of its affairs as a whole for the financial year and is of the view that the performance of the Board as a whole has been satisfactory.

# Principle 6: Access to Information

The Board is provided with complete, adequate and timely information prior to Board meetings on an on-going basis so as to enable it to make informed decisions to discharge its duties and responsibilities. The Company circulates copies of minutes of meeting of all Board Committees to the respective members of the Board to keep them informed of on-going development at the Group.

The RC seeks advice internally from the Head of Group Human Resources, who attends all RC meetings. If necessary, the RC may also seek professional advice externally on remuneration of directors, key executives or employees.

The RC reviews the Company’s obligations arising in the event of termination of the executive directors, key executive personnel’s contract of service, to ensure that such contracts of service contain fair and reasonable termination clauses which are not overly generous.

Where a decision has to be made before the Company’s Board meeting is convened, a Directors’ Resolution is circulated in accordance with the Company’s Constitution and the directors are provided with the necessary information that will allow them to make informed decisions. The Executive Chairman will also ensure that management promptly answers any queries raised by the directors.

# Annual Report 2018

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Captii Limited (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (the “group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the group and the statement of financial position of the company as at 31 December 2018, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows of the group, and statement of changes in equity of the company for the reporting year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the group and the financial position of the company as at 31 December 2018 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the group and of the changes in equity of the company for the reporting year ended on that date.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current reporting year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# a) Impairment testing of goodwill

Refer to Note 2A “Goodwill”, “Impairment of non-financial assets” and Note 2C “Estimated impairment of goodwill” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, and Note 16 “Intangible assets” for the key assumptions used in impairment testing of goodwill.

As at the reporting year end, the group has goodwill of $10.1 million, which comprised 18% of the group’s total assets, which arose from the acquisition of business. The amounts are allocated to certain cash generating unit (“CGU”) as at 31 December 2018. The CGU and goodwill are assessed annually for impairment. Management uses the value-in-use method to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill. The value-in-use calculation requires management of the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU as well as a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value of the recoverable amount of each CGU. In estimating the future cash flows of the CGU, management forecasted the revenue, growth rates and margins based on presently available information. These estimates require judgement and the determination of the recoverable amount is a key area of focus.

We discussed with management the process over the determination of estimates for forecasted revenues, growth rates, profit margins, tax rates and discount rates. As the assessment process is complex and highly judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, our audit procedures included, among others, using our in-house valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the group. We assessed management’s estimates applied in the value-in-use model based on our knowledge of the CGUs’ operations, and compared them against historical forecasts and performance. Our in-house valuation specialists also performed a review of the management’s methodology, expectations and the discount rate used in the impairment assessment and tested the accuracy of the computations. We have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive, that is, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill.

# b) Fair value of unquoted investments

Refer to Note 2A “Fair value measurement”, “Financial assets” and Note 2C “Fair value of unquoted investments” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, Note 19 “Investment in an associate” and Note 20 “Other financial assets” for the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the unquoted investments.

# Annual Report 2018

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Key audit matters (cont’d)

# b) Fair value of unquoted investments (cont’d)

Unquoted investments, comprised mainly of unquoted equity investments and unquoted debt securities, amounted to $11.2 million and represented approximately 20% of the group’s total assets, as at 31 December 2018. The fair value of these financial assets are determined with the assistance of independent external specialists and applying valuation methodology that involved difficult and complex management’s judgments because these securities are not traded in an active market. The determination of the fair value of the financial instruments using Level 3 inputs is considerably more subjective given the lack of availability of market-based data. For investments acquired during the year where there is a lack of observable inputs and profits and/or cash flows cannot be reliably determined, management considers various indicators where cost might not be representative of fair value.

We assessed the basis and process used by management in determining the fair value, and the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used to revalue the unquoted financial instruments. The audit team was supported by our in-house valuation specialists to assess whether the valuations arrived at by the group were appropriate by reference to acceptable valuation practice, market practice and SFRS(I) 13. We have also assessed the independence, competence and experience of the independent external valuer used by management in assessing their objectivity, professional qualifications and resources. As part of these audit procedures, we assessed the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation, by benchmarking them with external data. Finally, we have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements about the degree of estimation made when valuing these unquoted investments.

# Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the statement by directors and the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the financial reporting standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.

# Annual Report 2018

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont’d)

(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.

(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Lee Mong Sheong.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 31 DECEMBER 2018

# 1. General

Captii Limited (the “company”) is incorporated in Singapore with limited liability. It is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and they cover the company (referred to as “parent”) and its subsidiaries.

The board of directors approved and authorised these financial statements for issue on the date of the statement by directors.

The principal activities of the company are those of investment holding and the provision of management services.

The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.

The registered office and principal place of business of the company is located at 140 Paya Lebar Road, #10-14 AZ@Paya Lebar, Singapore 409015.

# Statement of compliance with financial reporting standards

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) and the related Interpretations to SFRS(I) (“SFRS(I) INT”) as issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council. They are in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 and with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

# Accounting convention

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except where a financial reporting standard requires an alternative treatment (such as fair values) as disclosed where appropriate in these financial statements. The accounting policies in the financial reporting standards may not be applied when the effect of applying them is not material. The disclosures required by financial reporting standards may not be provided if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material.

# Basis of preparation of the financial statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Apart from those involving estimations, management has made judgements in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies. The areas requiring management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed at the end of this note to the financial statements, where applicable.

# Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements made up to the end of the reporting year of the company and all of its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of the group (the parent and its subsidiaries) presented as those of a single economic entity and are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All significant intragroup balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the reporting entity obtains control of the investee and cease when the reporting entity loses control of the investee.

Changes in the group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for within equity as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. The carrying amounts of the group’s and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. When the group loses control of a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities and related equity components of the former subsidiary. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date when control is lost and is subsequently accounted as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments.

The company’s separate financial statements have been prepared on the same basis, and as permitted by the Companies Act, Chapter 50, the company’s separate statement of comprehensive income is not presented.

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information

# 2A. Significant accounting policies

# Revenue recognition

The financial reporting standard on revenue from contracts with customers establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer (which excludes estimates of variable consideration that are subject to constraints, such as right of return exists, trade discounts, volume rebates and changes to the transaction price arising from modifications), net of any related sales taxes and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. An asset (goods or services) is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that asset. As a practical expedient the effects of any significant financing component is not adjusted if the payment for the good or service will be within one year.

# Distinct goods or services in a series

For distinct goods or services in a series such as routine or recurring service contracts where the promise under the contract is for a specified quantity of goods or services that meets the over time criteria or is a stand-ready or single continuous service and if the nature of each good or service is distinct, substantially the same and has the same pattern of transfer or each time increment is distinct, then revenue is recognised at the amount that the entity has the right to bill a fixed amount for each unit of goods or service provided.

# Distinct goods or services created over time

For long-term service contracts and projects for developing an asset, the customer value is created over time during the contract period and it is accounted for as a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. This is because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity’s performance in processing each transaction as and when each transaction is processed; the performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or the performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The revenue is recognised over time by using the input method. For the input method the revenue is recognised on the basis of the efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation such as costs incurred, relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.

# Provisions for losses on contracts

When the current estimates of the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer, and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is made as soon as the loss becomes evident. An adjustment is also made to reflect the effects of the customer’s credit risk. The loss on a contract is reported as an additional contract cost (an operating expense), and not as a reduction of revenue or a non-operating expense.

# Other income

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

# Employee benefits

Certain subsidiaries have defined contribution retirement benefit plans in which employees are entitled to join upon fulfilling certain conditions. The entity contributes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the salary of each participating employee. Contributions are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate. This plan is contributions to government managed retirement benefit plans such as the Central Provident Fund in Singapore and Employees Provident Fund in Malaysia which specifies the employer’s obligations which are dealt with as defined contribution retirement benefit plans. For employee leave entitlement the expected cost of short-term employee benefits in the form of compensated absences is recognised in the case of accumulating compensated absences, when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences; and in the case of non-accumulating compensated absences, when the absences occur. A liability for bonuses is recognised where the entity is contractually obliged or where there is constructive obligation based on past practice.

# Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowings and are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method.

# Foreign currency transactions

The functional currency of the company is the Singapore dollar as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. At each end of the reporting year, recorded monetary balances and balances measured at fair value that are denominated in non-functional currencies are reported at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year and fair value measurement dates respectively. All realised and unrealised exchange adjustment gains and losses are dealt with in profit or loss except when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. The presentation is in the functional currency.

Translation of financial statements of other entities

Each entity in the group determines the appropriate functional currency as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the relevant reporting entity operates. In translating the financial statements of such an entity for incorporation in the consolidated financial statements in the presentation currency, the assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at the end of the reporting year rates of exchange and the income and expense items for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange for the reporting year. The resulting translation adjustments (if any) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of that relevant reporting entity.

Income tax

The income taxes are accounted using the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognised in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurements of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on provisions of the enacted or substantially enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Current and deferred income taxes are recognised as income or as an expense in profit or loss unless the tax relates to items that are recognised in the same or a different period outside profit or loss. For such items recognised outside profit or loss the current tax and deferred tax are recognised (a) in other comprehensive income if the tax is related to an item recognised in other comprehensive income and (b) directly in equity if the tax is related to an item recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same income tax authority and entity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realised. A deferred tax amount is recognised for all temporary differences, unless the deferred tax amount arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which (i) is not a business combination; and (ii) at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). A deferred tax liability or asset is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the reporting entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the taxable temporary difference and it is probable that the taxable temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or for deductible temporary differences, they will not reverse in the foreseeable future and they cannot be utilised against taxable profits.

Plant and equipment

Plant and equipment are carried at cost on initial recognition and after initial recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to allocate the gross carrying amounts of the assets less their residual values over their estimated useful lives of each part of an item of these assets. The annual rates of depreciation are as follows:

|Computers, telecommunications, research and development equipment|-|3 to 5 years|
|---|---|---|
|Office equipment, furniture, motor vehicle and renovation|-|5 years|

An asset is depreciated when it is available for use until it is derecognised even if during that period the item is idle. Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of plant and equipment is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is recognised in profit or loss. The residual value and the useful life of an asset is reviewed at least at each end of the reporting year and, if expectations differ significantly from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate, and the depreciation charge for the current and future periods are adjusted.

Cost also includes acquisition cost, borrowing cost capitalised and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset or component to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequent costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss when they are incurred.

# Investment property

Investment property is property owned or held under a finance lease to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes or sale in the ordinary course of business. It includes an investment property in the course of construction. After initial recognition at cost including transaction costs, the fair value model is used to measure the investment property at fair value on the existing use basis to reflect the actual market state and circumstances as of the end of the reporting year, not as of either a past or future date. A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment property is included in profit or loss for the reporting year in which it arises. The fair values are measured periodically on a systematic basis annually by external independent valuers having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued.

# Leases

Leases are classified as finance leases if substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. At the commencement of the lease term, a finance lease is recognised as an asset and as a liability in the statement of financial position at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each measured at the inception of the lease. The discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this is practicable to determine, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used. Any initial direct costs of the lessee are added to the amount recognised as an asset. The excess of the lease payments over the recorded lease liability are treated as finance charges which are allocated to each reporting year during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent rents are charged as expenses in the reporting years in which they are incurred. The assets are depreciated as owned depreciable assets. Leases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the leased assets are classified as operating leases. For operating leases, lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit, even if the payments are not on that basis. Lease incentives received are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the total lease expense.

# Intangible assets

An identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance is recognised as an intangible asset at acquisition cost if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. After initial recognition, an intangible asset with finite useful life is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. An intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity.

The amortisable amount of an intangible asset with finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life from the point at which the asset is ready for use. The useful lives are as follows:

|Development costs|-|5 years|
|---|---|---|
|Intellectual property|-|5 years|

Development costs – Development costs are typically internally generated intangible assets. Costs incurred in relation to individual projects are capitalised only when the future economic benefit of the project is probable and the following main conditions are met: (i) the development costs can be measured reliably, (ii) the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained and (iii) therefore it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.

# Subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an entity including unincorporated and special purpose entity that is controlled by the reporting entity and the reporting entity is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that the reporting entity has the practical ability to exercise (that is, substantive rights) are considered when assessing whether the reporting entity controls another entity. An investment in a subsidiary is accounted for at cost less any allowance for impairment in value. Impairment loss recognised in profit or loss for a subsidiary is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in a subsidiary are not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realised in a current market exchange.

Associates

An associate is an entity including an unincorporated entity in which the reporting entity has a significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the reporting entity. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

An investment in an associate is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss financial assets in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments (see note on financial instruments below).

Joint arrangement – joint venture

A joint arrangement (that is, either a joint operation or a joint venture, depending on the rights and obligations of the jointly controlling parties to the arrangement), is one in which the reporting entity is a party to an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control, which is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement; it exists only when decisions about the relevant activities (that is, activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a joint venture, the parties with joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The reporting interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method in accordance with the financial reporting standard on investments in joint ventures.

In the consolidated financial statements, the accounting for investment in a joint venture is on the equity method. Under the equity method the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of the investee’s net assets. The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in the joint venture are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realised in a current market exchange. The investor’s profit or loss includes its share of the investee’s profit or loss and the investor’s other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the reporting entity’s interest in the relevant joint venture are not recognised except to the extent that the reporting entity has an obligation. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the reporting entity and a joint venture are recognised in the financial statements only to the extent of unrelated reporting entity’s interests in the joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

Accounting policies of joint ventures are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the reporting entity. The reporting entity discontinues the use of the equity method from the date that when its investment ceases to be a joint venture and accounts for the investment in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments from that date. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former joint venture is measured at fair value at the date that it ceases to be a joint venture.

Business combinations

There were no acquisitions during the reporting year.

Non-controlling interests

The non-controlling interest is equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the reporting entity as the parent. The non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the equity of the owners of the company. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (subsidiary) is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Where the non-controlling interest is measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and key model inputs used are disclosed in the relevant note. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised. Goodwill is recognised as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (a) over (b); (a) being the aggregate of: (i) the consideration transferred which generally requires acquisition-date fair value; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations (measured either at fair value or as the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets); and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and (b) being the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations.

# 2A. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

# Goodwill (cont’d)

After initial recognition, goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, goodwill and also any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or any intangible asset not yet available for use are tested for impairment, at least annually. Goodwill impairment is not reversed in any circumstances.

For the purpose of impairment testing since the acquisition date of the business combination, goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree were assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than a segment.

# Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

# Impairment of non-financial assets

Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an annual impairment test is performed at about the same time every year on an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use. The carrying amount of other non-financial assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year for indications of impairment and where an asset is impaired, it is written down through profit or loss to its estimated recoverable amount. The impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount and is recognised in profit or loss. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. When the fair value less costs of disposal method is used, any available recent market transactions are taken into consideration. When the value–in-use method is adopted, in assessing the value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). At the end of each reporting year, non-financial assets other than goodwill with impairment loss recognised in prior periods are assessed for possible reversal of the impairment. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been measured, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

# Financial instruments

# Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments:

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) are recognised and derecognised, as applicable, using trade date accounting or settlement date accounting. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. A financial liability is removed from the statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished, that is, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires. At initial recognition the financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.

# Classification and measurement of financial assets:

1. Financial asset classified as measured at amortised cost: A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), that is (a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Typically trade and other receivables, bank and cash balances are classified in this category.

# Classification and measurement of financial assets (cont’d):

1. Financial asset that is a debt asset instrument classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”): There were no financial assets classified in this category at reporting year end date.
2. Financial asset that is an equity investment measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”): There were no financial assets classified in this category at reporting year end date.
3. Financial asset classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”): All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, management may irrevocably designate a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.

# Classification and measurement of financial liabilities:

Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) in either of the following circumstances: (1) the liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or (2) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. All other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Reclassification of any financial liability is not permitted.

# Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows include bank and cash balances, on demand deposits and any highly liquid debt asset instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. For the consolidated statement of cash flows, the item includes cash and cash equivalents less cash subject to restriction that form an integral part of cash management.

# Fair value measurement

The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, market observable data to the extent possible is used. If the fair value of an asset or a liability is not directly observable, an estimate is made using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs (eg by use of the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar items, discounted cash flow analysis, or option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances). Inputs used are consistent with the characteristics of the asset / liability that market participants would take into account. The entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil a liability is not taken into account as relevant when measuring fair value.

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the measurement are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices). Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.

The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. The fair values of non-current financial instruments may not be disclosed separately unless there are significant differences at the end of the reporting year and in the event the fair values are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements.

# 2B. Other explanatory information

Provisions

A liability or provision is recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A provision is made using best estimates of the amount required in settlement and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount recognised is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. Changes in estimates are reflected in profit or loss in the reporting year they occur.

Segment reporting

The reporting entity discloses financial and descriptive information about its consolidated reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. Generally, financial information is reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties

The critical judgements made in the process of applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting year are discussed below. These estimates and assumptions are periodically monitored to ensure they incorporate all relevant information available at the date when financial statements are prepared. However, this does not prevent actual figures differing from estimates.

Estimated impairment of goodwill

An assessment is made annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment loss, based on the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (“CGU”). The recoverable amounts of the CGUs was determined based on value-in-use calculations and these calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates as disclosed in Note 16C. The assessment process is complex and highly judgemental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. The carrying amount of the group’s goodwill as at the end of the reporting year was $10,060,000 (2017: $10,583,000).

Impairment of intangible assets other than goodwill

An assessment is made of the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that trigger an impairment review include underperformance relative to historical or projected future results, significant changes in the manner of the use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. The carrying amount of intangible assets other than goodwill as at the end of the reporting year was $990,000 (2017: $1,063,000).

Development costs

Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established plan. Management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of profits. Should a project fail to substantiate its estimated feasibility or life cycle, material development costs may be required to be written off in future periods. The carrying amount has been disclosed in Note 16.

Useful lives of plant and equipment

The estimates for the useful lives and related depreciation charges for plant and equipment are based on commercial and other factors which could change significantly as a result of innovations and in response to market conditions. The depreciation charge is increased where useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, or the carrying amounts written off or written down for technically obsolete items or assets that have been abandoned. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects. It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next reporting year that are different from assumptions could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the balances affected. The carrying amount of the class of assets as at the end of the reporting year affected by the assumption was $1,825,000 (2017: $1,694,000).

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties (cont’d)

Allowance for trade receivables

The trade receivables are subject to the expected credit loss model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. The expected lifetime losses are recognised from initial recognition of these assets. These assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due for measuring the expected credit losses. The credit loss allowance is based on historical observed default rates (over a period of certain months) over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. The loss allowance was determined accordingly. The carrying amounts might change materially within the next reporting year but these changes may not arise from assumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year. The carrying amount is disclosed in the Note 22.

Revenue recognised over time

The entity has revenue where the performance obligation is satisfied over time. Revenue is recognised over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. A single method is applied consistently for measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time. Judgment is required when selecting a method (output or input methods) for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation. Assessing the satisfaction of performance obligations over time requires judgment and the consideration of many criteria that should be met to qualify such as whether the customer presently is obligated to pay for an asset, whether the customer has legal title, whether the entity has transferred physical possession of the asset, whether the customer has assumed the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and whether the customer has accepted the asset. Events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected. Even if the events anticipated under the assumptions occur, actual results are still likely to be different from the estimates since other anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected and the variation may be material. The related account balances at the end of the reporting year are disclosed in Notes 5, 23A and 27A on revenues, contract assets and contract liabilities.

Measurement of impairment of subsidiaries

When a subsidiary is in net equity deficit and has suffered operating losses, the recoverable amount of the investee is estimated to assess whether the investment in the investee has suffered any impairment. This measurement requires significant judgement. An estimate is made of the future profitability of the investee, and the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flows. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects. It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next reporting year that are different from assumptions could require adjustments to the carrying amount of the investments in subsidiaries. The carrying amount of the company’s specific assets at the end of the reporting year affected by the assumptions is $11,000,000 (2017: $11,000,000).

Fair value of unquoted investments

If a financial asset is not traded in an active market or if the quoted price is not readily and regularly available, the fair value is established by using valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement requires the selection among a range of different valuation methodologies, making estimates about risk free rate and volatility rates. The models are tested for validity by calibrating to prices from any observable current market transactions in the same instrument when available. Where cost is used as an estimate of fair value, significant judgement is required where management considers various indicators where cost might not be representative of fair value. The carrying amount is disclosed in Notes 19 and 20.

Income tax amounts

The entity recognises tax liabilities and assets based on an estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items. Where the actual amount arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax amounts in the period when such determination is made. In addition management judgement is required in determining the amount of current and deferred tax recognised and the extent to which amounts should or can be recognised. A deferred tax asset is recognised if it is probable that the entity will earn sufficient taxable profit in future periods to benefit from a reduction in tax payments. This involves the management making assumptions within its overall tax planning activities and periodically reassessing them in order to reflect changed circumstances as well as tax regulations. As a result, due to their inherent nature, assessments of likelihood are judgmental and not susceptible to precise determination. The income tax amounts are disclosed in Note 11.

# 4. Financial information by operating segments

# 4A. Information about reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities

Disclosure of information about operating segments, products and services, the geographical areas, and the major customers are made as required by the financial reporting standard on operating segments. This disclosure standard has no impact on the reported financial performance or financial position of the reporting entity.

For management purposes the reporting entity is organised into the three major strategic operating segments that offer different products and services. Such a structural organisation is determined by the nature of risks and returns associated with each business segment and it defines the management structure as well as the internal reporting system. It represents the basis on which the management reports the primary segment information that is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. They are managed separately because each business requires different strategies.

The segments and the types of products and services are as follows:

- Unifiedcomms – Segment for content-driven mobile value-added services (“VAS”), messaging and signaling systems, solutions and managed services.
- GlobeOSS – Segment for mobile network operation support systems, solutions and managed services.
- Captii Ventures – Segment for strategic investment in early and late-stage technology ventures.
- Others – Segment for investment holding and operational headquarters of the group.

Inter-segment sales are measured on the basis that the entity actually used to price the transfers. Internal transfer pricing policies of the reporting entity are as far as practicable based on market prices. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

The following tables illustrate the information about the reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities.

The group’s revenue can be divided into revenue generated from two types of contracts, as described below:

(a) System sales – this refers to contracts that involve the outright purchase by customers of systems comprising the group’s products and technologies, and where these systems are in turn delivered as turnkey solutions. The scope of work for a system sale contract includes system design, implementation, testing and commissioning services.

(b) Managed services – this refers to contracts that involve the provision of both systems comprising the group’s products and technologies as well as the group’s professional services, on a recurring, revenue sharing, software-as-a-service, pay-per-use or monthly or quarterly fixed and variable fee basis. Also treated as a managed service contract are system maintenance and technical support contracts with existing customers of the group, and an operating lease with a lessee.

Revenue of $12,960,000 (2017: $9,709,000) and $4,268,000 (2017: $3,941,000) are derived from two (2017: two) external customers. The former is attributable to the Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS business segments while the latter is attributable to the Unifiedcomms business segment.

There are no income tax consequences of dividends to owners of the company.

Two subsidiaries of the group in Malaysia, GlobeOSS Sdn Bhd and Postpay Technology Sdn Bhd, have been granted pioneer status as Multimedia Super Corridor (“MSC”) companies under the Malaysia Promotion of Investment Act, 1986. The benefits to a company having MSC status include a five year pioneer status tax exemption on profits generated from the MSC qualifying activities during the same period. The MSC status of GlobeOSS Sdn Bhd after being extended once, expired on 14 January 2017. The MSC status of Postpay Technology Sdn Bhd commenced from 21 December 2015 and will expire on 20 December 2020.

In addition, the company’s wholly-owned subsidiary company, Unified Communications (OHQ) Sdn Bhd received the Malaysia Industry Development Authority’s approval in October 2009 of its Operational Headquarters (“OHQ”) status to provide certain approved OHQ services to the group entities. This OHQ status is granted for 10 years with certain tax incentives which will expire in 2019.

As at 31 December 2018, the strata title of the investment property has not been issued by Department of Director General of Lands and Mines in Malaysia.

There are no restrictions on the realisability of investment property or the remittance of income and proceeds on disposal.

The investment property was leased out in previous reporting years, and the lease was terminated in November 2016 upon expiry of the lease term.

The fair value of the investment property was measured in December 2018 based on the highest and best use method to reflect the actual market state and circumstances as of the end of the reporting year. The fair value was based on a valuation made by C H Williams Talhar & Wong, a firm of independent professional valuers, which hold a recognised and relevant professional qualification with sufficient recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year. Management determined that the highest and best use of the assets is the current use and that it would provide maximum value to market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets.

# For fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 (2017: Level 2) of the fair value hierarchy, a description of the valuation techniques and the significant other observable inputs used in the fair value measurement are as follows:

Asset: Freehold property at Lot 3A-5-1, 5th Floor, Block 3A, Plaza Sentral, 50470, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

Fair value: $2,305,000 (2017: $2,660,000)

Valuation technique for recurring fair value measurements: Comparison with market evidence of recent transaction prices for similar properties.

Significant observable inputs: Price per square foot. $286 (2017: $330)

Sensitivity on management’s estimates – Impact – lower by $231,000 (2017: $266,000); higher by $231,000 (2017: $266,000).

There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the year.

The transfer from Level 2 to Level 3 for the investment property was due to a lack of observable market data, resulting from decrease in comparable transaction for the investment property. The decrease in fair value is due to changes in the market conditions and foreign exchange adjustments during the reporting year.

# 16. Intangible assets (cont’d)

# 16A. Deferred development costs

Deferred development cost mainly comprises staff costs, operating expenses and depreciation expenses for the development of the group’s proprietary mobile software and has an average remaining amortisation period of 2 years (2017: 2 years).

# 16B. Intellectual property

Intellectual property comprises rights and titles relating to mobile software.

# 16C. Goodwill

Goodwill acquired through business combination has been allocated to Unified Communications Pte Ltd and its subsidiaries, Postpay Sdn Bhd and Ahead Mobile Sdn Bhd for the purpose of impairment testing. The carrying amount is disclosed above.

The goodwill was tested for impairment at the end of the reporting year. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit (“CGU’’) exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value-in-use. The recoverable amounts of the CGU have been measured based on the value-in-use method.

The value-in-use was determined by management using discounted cash flow valuation technique. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations, which are unobservable inputs, are as follows:

|Unobservable inputs|31.12.2018|31.12.2017|
|---|---|---|
|Estimated discount rates that reflect current market assessments at the risks specific to the CGU|13.43%|12%|
|Growth rates based on management estimate forecasts and not exceeding the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets|2%|2%|
|Cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans approved by management|5 years|5 years|

The value-in-use is a recurring fair value measurement (Level 3).

The impairment loss on goodwill of $500,000 (2017: Nil) during the year is due to lower value-in-use of the CGU, which have produced lower than expected profitability and returns.

Actual outcomes could vary from the estimates used above. If the estimated discount rate applied to the cash flows had been 0.25% lower with other variables held constant, the value-in-use amount would have been higher by approximately $500,000 and there will be no impairment of goodwill. However, if the estimated discount rate applied to the cash flows had been 0.25% higher with other variables held constant, there would be a comparable impact in the opposite direction on the value-in-use amount, which has a more adverse effect on the profit or loss.

# 20C. Fair value measurements (Level 3) recognised in the statement of financial position

The group adopted the following valuation methodologies in estimating the fair values of the investments:

(a) Cost approach: This is applied to estimate fair value of companies in very preliminary development stage where revenue forecast is difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty, and assumes the book value or cost of an asset approximates its fair value. Adjustments, such as impairment allowance, are made to assets on a case-by-case basis if this assumption does not hold true.

(b) Option Pricing Model (“OPM”): The OPM, which applies the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing, is a generally accepted valuation methodology used in estimating fair values of early stage companies, in particular those with different classes of shares. In applying the OPM to determine the fair value of an investee, management considers terms such as level of seniority among the securities, dividend policy, conversion ratios, and cash allocations of the various stockholders’ agreements with the investee that would affect the distributions to each class of equity upon a liquidity event. In addition, the method implicitly considers the effect of the liquidation preference as of the future liquidation date, not as of the valuation date.

The key assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes formula which are unobservable inputs, are as follows:

|Unobservable inputs|2018|2017|Sensitivity of inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|---|
|Risk free rates (range)|1.9% – 8.16%|1.69% – 6.12%|Increase (decrease) of the inputs would result in|
|Asset volatility (range)|51.46% – 60.34%|38.0% – 60.0%|decrease (increase) in fair values|
|Expected terms (years)|3 to 5|5 to 5.38| |

The group has the policy to regularly assess and evaluate the appropriate valuation methodologies in ascertaining the fair value of the investments.

Certain trade receivables relating to a project of a subsidiary has been pledged for bank facilities (see Note 28).

The trade receivables are subject to the expected credit loss model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. The methodology applied for impairment loss is the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses (“ECL”) which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. The expected lifetime losses are recognised from initial recognition of these assets. These assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due for measuring the expected credit losses. The credit loss allowance is based on its historical observed default rates (over a period of certain months) over the expected life of the trade receivables. At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated. There is no loss allowance arising from outstanding balances as the ECL is not material.

|Gross amount|31.12.2018|31.12.2017|Loss allowance|31.12.2018|31.12.2017|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Group| | | | | |

|Past due:|Below 3 months|1,304|2,651|–|–|

| |Over 9 months|6|–|6|–|
|Total|14,587|15,179|6|6| |

The amounts are written off when there are indications that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery or the failure of a debtor to make contractual payments over an extended period. There are no collateral held as security and other credit enhancements for the trade receivables.

As part of the process of setting customer credit limits, different credit terms are used. The average credit period generally granted to trade customers is between 30 to 90 days (2017: 30 to 90 days). But some customers take a longer period to settle the amounts.

# 22. Trade and other receivables (cont’d)

The other receivables of the group and company at amortised cost shown above are subject to the expected credit loss model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. The other receivables at amortised cost and which can be graded as low risk individually are considered to have low credit risk. No loss allowance is necessary.

At each subsequent reporting date, an evaluation is made whether there is a significant change in credit risk by comparing the debtor’s credit risk at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified cash flows) with the credit risk at the reporting date (based on the modified cash flows). Adjustment to the loss allowance is made for any increase or decrease in credit risk.

To determine whether a financial instrument has low credit risk, management uses its internal credit risk ratings (such as external rating of “investment grade” of a financial instrument) or other methodologies that are consistent with a globally understood definition of low credit risk (such as market participant perspective taking into account all of the terms and conditions of the financial instrument).

Other receivables of the group and company are normally with no fixed terms and therefore there is no maturity. Other receivables are regarded as of low credit risk if they have a low risk of default and the debtor has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term. The methodology applied for impairment loss depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

|Group and Company|Number of shares issued ’000|Share capital $’000|

|Ordinary shares of no par value:|31,957|31,948|

The ordinary shares of no par value are fully paid, carry one vote each and have no right to fixed income. The company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Capital management:

The objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the reporting entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for owners and benefits for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to owners by pricing the sales commensurately with the level of risk. The management sets the amount of capital to meet its requirements and the risk taken. There were no changes in the approach to capital management during the reporting year. The management manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it where necessary or possible in the light of changes in conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the management may adjust the amount of dividends paid to owners, return capital to owners, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

In order to maintain its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange, the company has to have share capital with at least a free float of 10% of the shares. The company met the capital requirement on its initial listing and the rules limiting treasury share purchases mean it will continue to satisfy that requirement, as it did throughout the reporting year. Management receives a report from the share registrars frequently on substantial share interests showing the non-free float to ensure continuing compliance with the 10% limit throughout the reporting year.

The management does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to support its business and to add value for shareholders. The key discipline adopted is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed and the cost of that capital.

There are no significant external borrowings. The debt-to-adjusted capital ratio does not provide a meaningful indicator of the risk of borrowing.

|Expected to be recognised within 1 year|2,135|679|

The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for which transfer of control has not occurred at year end, and therefore revenue is not recognised. The estimated transaction price does not include amounts of variable consideration that are constrained.

The increase in contract liability balances was due to an increase in advance consideration received prior to the recognition of revenue particularly for a major project by one of its subsidiary during the year.

Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.

# 31B. Financial risk management

The main purpose for holding or issuing financial instruments is to raise and manage the operating, investing and financing activities. There are exposures to the financial risks on such as credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk comprising interest rate, currency risk and price risk exposures. Management has certain practices for the management of financial risks and action to be taken in order to manage the financial risks. The guidelines include the following:

- (i) Minimise interest rate, currency, credit and market risks for all kinds of transactions.
- (ii) Maximise the use of “natural hedge”: favouring as much as possible the natural off-setting of sales and costs and payables and receivables denominated in the same currency and therefore put in place hedging strategies only for the excess balance. The same strategy is pursued with regard to interest rate risk.
- (iii) All financial risk management activities are carried out and monitored by senior management staff.
- (iv) All financial risk management activities are carried out following acceptable market practices.
- (v) Consideration is given to investing in financial instruments in accordance with the investment strategy of the reporting entity.

There have been no changes to the exposures to risk; the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk.

The group and company are exposed to currency and interest rate risks. There are no arrangements to reduce such risk exposures through derivatives and other hedging instruments.

# 31C. Fair value of financial instruments

The analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These include the significant financial instruments stated at amortised cost and at fair value in the statement of financial position. The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

# 31D. Credit risk on financial assets

Financial assets that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk and failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations in full or in a timely manner. These arise principally from cash balances with banks, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the total of the fair value of the financial assets at the end of the reporting year. Credit risk on cash balances with banks and any other financial instruments is limited because the counter parties are entities with acceptable credit ratings. For expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets, the three-stage approach in the financial reporting standard on financial instruments is used to measure the impairment allowance. Under this approach the financial assets move through the three stages as their credit quality changes.

However, a simplified approach is permitted by the financial reporting standards on financial instruments for financial assets that do not have a significant financing component, such as trade receivables. Management adopts the simplified approach to measure the impairment loss for financial assets. On initial recognition, a day-1 loss is recorded equal to the 12 month ECL (or lifetime ECL for trade receivables), unless the assets are considered credit impaired. For credit risk on trade receivables an ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the debtors and an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Reviews and assessments of credit exposures in excess of designated limits are made. Renewals and reviews of credits limits are subject to the same review process.

Note 24 discloses the maturity of the cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of the standard on financial instruments. There was no identified impairment loss.

# 31E. Liquidity risk – financial liabilities maturity analysis

The liquidity risk refers to the difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. It is expected that all the liabilities will be settled at their contractual maturity. The average credit period taken to settle trade payables is about 30 to 60 days (2017: 30 to 60 days). The other payables are with short-term durations. The classification of the financial assets is shown in the statement of financial position as they may be available to meet liquidity needs and no further analysis is deemed necessary.

The undiscounted amounts on the borrowings with floating interest rates are determined by reference to the conditions existing at the reporting date.

The company’s non-derivative financial liabilities will be settled within 1 year.

The company has issued the following:

(a) Financial guarantee to a financial institution for banking facilities granted to a subsidiary. The banking facilities are secured by fixed deposits of the subsidiary amounting to approximately $2,536,000 (2017: $2,479,000) and covered by a personal guarantee of a director of the subsidiary and corporate guarantee of the company of $2,016,000 (2017: $505,000). As at the end of the financial year, the outstanding facilities covered by the guarantee were $296,000 (2017: Nil).

(b) Financial guarantee to a financial institution for term loan granted to a subsidiary. The term loan is secured mainly by assignment of proceeds receivable from a project of the subsidiary, and corporate guarantee of the company of $2,973,000 (2017: Nil). As at the end of the financial year, the outstanding loan covered by the guarantee were $1,722,000 (2017: Nil).

Financial guarantee contracts - For issued financial guarantee contracts the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee could be called. At the end of the reporting year no claims on the financial guarantees are expected to be payable.

Financial guarantee contracts if significant are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance the financial reporting standard on financial instruments and (b) the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of the financial reporting standard on revenue from contracts with customers.

The unutilised borrowing facilities are available for operating activities and to settle other commitments. Borrowing facilities are maintained to ensure funds are available for the operations.

# 31F. Interest rate risk

The group and the company are not subject to significant interest rate risk exposure.

# 31G. Foreign currency risk

Foreign exchange risk arises on financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency, ie in a currency other than the functional currency in which they are measured. For the purpose of this financial reporting standard on financial instruments: disclosures, currency risk does not arise from financial instruments that are non-monetary items or from financial instruments denominated in the functional currency.

The above table shows sensitivity to a hypothetical percentage variation in the functional currency against the relevant material non-functional foreign currencies. The sensitivity rate used is the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. For similar rate weakening of the functional currency against the relevant foreign currencies above, there would be comparable impacts in the opposite direction on profit or loss.

The hypothetical changes in exchange rates are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The sensitivity analysis is disclosed for each non-functional currency to which the entity has significant exposure at end of the reporting year. The analysis above has been carried out on the basis that there are no hedged transactions.

In management’s opinion, the above sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the foreign currency risks as the historical exposure does not reflect the exposure in future.

# 31H. Equity price risk

There are instruments in equity shares, related derivatives or similar instruments. As a result, such investments are exposed to both currency risk and market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities. The fair values of these assets and sensitivity analysis are disclosed in Notes 19 and 20.

# (a) Undertaking to support subsidiaries with deficits

The company has undertaken to provide continued financial support to certain of its subsidiaries which have total
accumulated losses in excess of the issued and paid-up capital as at 31 December 2018 amounting in aggregate to
$655,000 (2017: $1,761,000) to enable them to continue to operate as going concerns and to meet their obligations
as and when they fall due for at least 12 months from the end of the reporting year.

# (b) Litigation

On 19 November 2013, Unified Telecom Private Limited (“UTPL”), a joint venture of Unified Communications Pte
Ltd (“UCPL”), filed a petition to the High Court of Delhi, New Delhi in India under Section 9 of India Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 to obtain interim relief on the protection of assets currently under the custody of a former
customer, a mobile telecoms network operator and service provider in India (the “Telco”), and to deny the penalty
claims by the Telco against UTPL.

The Telco had via a letter issued in July 2013 alleged that UTPL is liable for a sum of INR 10.7 crore (approximately
$2.2 million) for damages and expenditure incurred in connection with the contract during its currency.

Legal advice has been sought from reputable law firms in both India and Singapore with good credentials in
handling contract litigation and dispute resolution, to review and advise on the merit of this claim by the Telco on
UTPL. Based on the legal opinions obtained from the law firm concerned, management is of the view that UTPL has
full rights and title to the assets and should be entitled to demand their return, and that the Telco’s claim against
UTPL has no legal merit. Accordingly, external legal counsels in Singapore and India have been appointed to advise
and represent UCPL and UTPL to pursue legal recourse.

As announced by the company on 16 January 2015, the hearing on the petition filed by UTPL which was originally
scheduled to be heard on 23 April 2014, having been adjourned on several occasions, was dismissed by the High
Court, as the Telco had initiated the arbitration proceedings before a tribunal. The High Court was of the view that
the matter should be resolved through arbitration proceedings since the tribunal had already been constituted.

During the reporting year 2015, UTPL commenced an application pursuant to Section 17 of the Indian Arbitration
and Conciliation Act 1996 for, amongst others, the return of the Hardware. However, the learned Arbitrator
dismissed the application, but directed Telco to ensure the safety of and protect the Hardware from any damage
during the period the Hardware is lying in Telco’s premises.

A number of procedural hearings have been held by the Arbitrator to cross examine the affidavits of the admissions
and denial documents relating to the aforesaid claim and counterclaims throughout the years. The next hearing has
tentatively been set on 18 April 2019.

In the opinion of management, no material losses are expected to arise pertaining to the aforesaid contingent
matter.

# 33. Changes and adoption of financial reporting standards
