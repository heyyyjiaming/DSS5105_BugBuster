# OCBC Sustainability Report 2023

# The Strengths of One Group.

# The Power of One Brand.

# About This Report

OCBC is committed to accelerating the transition to a net-zero future, while conducting our business responsibly and bringing impact to our communities. We do this through our close engagement and collaboration with our customers and key stakeholders.

# Scope

OCBC Group’s Sustainability Report covers our approach to sustainability, as well as the initiatives and performance of our operations in key markets – Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China. This report covers the financial year ending 31 December 2023.

The disclosures in this report are provided at a consolidated level, covering all operations except Great Eastern Holdings, unless otherwise stated. Great Eastern Holdings, a subsidiary of OCBC Group and a publicly listed company, publishes a separate Sustainability Report that provides detailed Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data concerning its operations. We recommend that this report be read in conjunction with Great Eastern Holdings’ sustainability disclosures for a full overview of our performance.

Where applicable, data from previous financial years are included for comparison. This report should also be read together with the OCBC Annual Report, which can be found here:

# Reporting Framework

This Sustainability Report is prepared in accordance with the following standards, guidelines and regulations:

- Singapore Exchange (SGX) Securities Trading Limited Mainboard Listing Rules 711A and 711B on Sustainability Reporting;
- SGX Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide (updated January 2022);
- Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Topic and Universal Standards (updated 2021);
- GRI G4 Financial Services Sector Disclosures;
- Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards for Commercial Banks; and
- Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

By aligning with the GRI Standards, we have applied the reporting principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, completeness, sustainability context, timeliness and verifiability.

This Sustainability Report adheres to the above standards due to their global acceptance and adoption as well as their robust industry guidance, which allows for comparability against global and local peers. These standards also provide the framework to communicate relevant information to stakeholders on the Bank’s ESG risks and opportunities.

OCBC acknowledges that climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenges facing society, businesses and the economy. By aligning our climate-related disclosures with the TCFD recommendations, we can articulate the climate-related risks and impacts to the Bank as well as the approaches taken to manage such risks and capture new opportunities. We have also taken SGX’s proposed list of core ESG metrics as guidance in disclosing a common and standardised set of ESG metrics, and have aligned our ESG data disclosures accordingly.

Please refer to our Annual Report for more information by scanning the QR code.

As the Bank is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and its Ten Principles, our Communication of Progress (CoP) is also included in this report. By embedding the Ten Principles of the UNGC into our strategies, policies and procedures, as well as establishing a culture of integrity on topics such as Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption, OCBC affirms our commitment and responsibilities to people and planet.

# Data and External Assurance

To ensure the robustness and credibility of our ESG data, OCBC has an established internal review process. Additionally, we have sought external assurance on selected indicators that are material to our operations this year. Our external assurance report is on page 95. We will continue to improve on our ESG disclosures and may expand the scope of the assurance over time.

# About This Report

# Board Statement

As a leading financial institution in ASEAN, our purpose is to enable people and communities to realise their aspirations. In light of the unprecedented impacts of climate change and the global shift towards a low-carbon economy, our clients are taking concrete steps to future-proof their business models, capitalise on opportunities arising from the net-zero transition, and do what is right for the environment. This transition will have a profound impact on all industries and will require substantial investments in the coming decades.

To support our clients, we have aligned our own strategy by establishing sector-specific net-zero targets, and we are fully committed to leveraging on our multifaceted businesses to channel capital towards sustainable initiatives that promote the greening of our economies. At the same time, we are committed to enhancing the wellbeing of our employees and the communities we serve, while upholding strong governance systems to ensure the robustness of our operations.

Our Sustainability Report explains how we are embedding sustainability into the fabric of OCBC’s operations and making progress in achieving our ESG goals to create sustainable value for our clients, employees, investors and communities.

# Accelerating the Transition to a Net-Zero Future

In May 2023, we unveiled sectoral net-zero targets as part of our commitment to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050. Our net-zero targets cover six key sectors: Power, Oil & Gas, Real Estate, Steel, Aviation and Shipping, which comprise 42% of OCBC’s corporate and commercial banking loan portfolio. Notably, OCBC will not extend project financing to upstream oil and gas projects that obtained approval for development after 2021. To drive our net-zero ambitions, we have actively enabled our clients’ transition through strategic advisory and innovative financial solutions. In 2023, we recorded $56 billion in committed sustainable finance, surpassing our $50 billion target two years ahead of schedule.

In 2023, in addition to our existing portfolio of sustainable and transition financing solutions, we launched the OCBC 1.5°C loan in a concrete step to partner with our clients on their net-zero journey. This sustainability-linked loan is Singapore’s first net-zero-aligned loan that is designed to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy for corporates in line with internationally recognised, science-based decarbonisation pathways for their sectors.

To drive sustainable innovation and enterprises, we organised the OCBC Sustainability Innovation Challenge and introduced the Emerging Enterprise Sustainability Award in Singapore to recognise emerging enterprises that are capitalising on growth opportunities in the green economy.

# Bringing Impact to Communities

In 2023, we continued to make progress in creating a better workplace and society. We initiated the Grow Your Way Expedition, a skills-first mobility initiative resulting in 12,000 activity completions by employees and a 75% rise in career awareness within the Bank. In Singapore, we embarked on two long-term volunteering projects, Families100 by OCBC and Care Corner ElderConnect, involving more than 1,200 volunteers to provide targeted assistance to 100 families and 3,500 seniors respectively. We launched our inaugural non-conventional talent hire initiative in Singapore, focusing on reintegrating mothers, caregivers and retirees, integrating persons with disabilities into the workforce, and providing career transition opportunities for retiring servicemen. In Indonesia, our Women Warriors Programme continues to empower women entrepreneurs, fulfilling their potential and promoting economic inclusion and gender equality. With over 1,300 women entrepreneurs supported to date, the programme has provided loans amounting to IDR 3.2 trillion ($270 million).

# Conducting Our Business Responsibly

We consider sustainability issues in OCBC’s business and strategy, and we determine the material ESG factors. We oversee the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors as well as the execution of OCBC’s sustainability strategy. In February 2023, we established the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) to strengthen this oversight, working closely with the Sustainability Council to synergistically bolster efforts in managing and monitoring sustainability performance. In August 2023, we appointed our first Group Chief Sustainability Officer to actively lead our sustainability strategy, drive effective alignment across the Group and steer our efforts in supporting our clients’ net-zero transition. We also rolled out a first-to-market set of anti-malware security measures on our OCBC digital app, preventing customer losses of over $2 million in Singapore.

# The Way Forward

We will continue to focus on climate-related matters and weave environmental and social factors into our business. In partnership with our clients, we can meaningfully contribute to a Net-Zero ASEAN and Greater China by 2050 in an orderly and just transition. Working with our stakeholders, we can play our part in the creation of a vibrant ecosystem championing innovative sustainability solutions. By taking a One Group approach, we can deliver on our sustainability commitments and drive value and growth, across our multifaceted businesses – for now and beyond.

OCBC is committed to driving the transition to a sustainable low-carbon world. Our aspirations are aligned with our clients’ and we believe that supporting the climate transition is crucial to shaping the future.

# Our Sustainability Governance Structure

Good corporate governance and risk management form the bedrock of a sustainable business and underpin long-term success. At OCBC, we are dedicated to upholding business integrity and we have embedded sustainability focus across the Board, Board Committees, Management and functional groups, enabling us to realise our sustainability ambitions through our Sustainability Framework.

We made significant progress in 2023 to enhance our sustainability governance structure. The objectives were two-fold: to strengthen oversight of sustainability matters at a strategic level; and to cultivate greater synergy and collaborations across functions to achieve targeted and impactful sustainability outcomes. With sustainability as a strategic priority, we established the Board Sustainability Committee to provide oversight and direction on sustainability imperatives. We also appointed our first Group Chief Sustainability Officer (GCSO) to actively lead our sustainability strategy, ensure synergy across the Group and guide our efforts in supporting our clients’ transition to net zero.

# Board

The Board takes ultimate responsibility for and sets the organisation’s strategic direction and execution for all aspects of sustainability at OCBC. In 2023, the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) was established to support the Board in its oversight of the Bank’s sustainability matters in conjunction with other relevant Board Committees. Chaired by an independent director, the BSC meets at least twice a year to provide strategic direction on sustainability issues, with a focus on climate and environmental matters. It approves and oversees the management and monitoring of ESG factors that are material to the business and considers the Bank’s position on relevant emerging sustainability trends and issues. It also has oversight of the Bank’s sustainability reporting including climate-related disclosures.

The BSC oversees the Bank’s net-zero strategy including the relevant targets. Further, the BSC reviews the sector-specific decarbonisation strategies for six priority sectors to support our clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) supports the Board in its oversight of the effective management of all the risks faced by the Bank, including ESG risks such as climate change. The management of ESG risks is described in our Responsible Financing Framework and Policies, which are reviewed and approved regularly by the BRMC.(1) The Board also oversees, through the Remuneration Committee, the human resource management policies and the policies governing the compensation of executive officers of the Bank and its subsidiaries, as well as the remuneration of senior executives and Directors. In its review, the Remuneration Committee may consider incorporating sustainability performance in the assessment of performance and compensation of senior executives.

All members of the Board have attended sustainability training(2) to ensure they have the relevant expertise to carry out their responsibilities and are keeping abreast of current and emerging sustainability issues such as climate and the environment. Beyond that, the Bank provides capacity building and training in sustainability-related topics across all levels of the organisation.

# Management

# Sustainability Council

The Sustainability Council (SC) is a management committee established to support the Board of Directors and the BSC in executing the sustainability strategy for the Bank. Chaired by the Group Chief Executive Officer, the SC comprises members of senior management, and is supported by the Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC). The SC oversees the Group’s sustainability strategy and its implementation, including identifying and assessing sustainability-related risks and opportunities with a focus on climate and environmental matters. In addition, the SC ensures that the Group’s material sustainability risks and opportunities are monitored through metrics on an ongoing basis and are effectively managed. The SC also provides strategic direction for the SSC. To ensure effective oversight of the Bank’s sustainability progress and climate-related matters, the SC meets at least three times a year.

# Sustainability Steering Committee

The SSC is a management committee newly established in 2023 to support the SC in the alignment, execution and reporting of key sustainability-related outcomes and initiatives for the Group. Chaired by the GCSO, the SSC comprises key leaders from the Group’s business units and key subsidiaries in driving sustainability-related initiatives across the Group. The SSC is responsible for the recommendation and implementation of Group’s sustainability strategy, informing the SC of the Group’s sustainability progress and advising the SC on sustainability-related matters. As the SSC comprises representatives from various business units across the Group, they are able to identify climate-related risks and opportunities that have the potential to impact the environment, society and the economy positively and negatively. The wide representation ensures that climate change-related issues are integrated into our decision-making process, escalated and addressed at the highest levels.

# Our Approach

# WHY sustainability matters to OCBC

Sustainability is at the heart of OCBC’s business, anchored on our purpose to enable people and communities to realise their aspirations. We believe that our ambition to be Asia’s leading financial services partner for a sustainable future can only be achieved if it is underpinned by our focus on sustainability.

# Purpose

# Opportunity

As we help our clients achieve their aspirations, we future-proof our business, build competitive advantage and capture opportunities for growth. We aim to excel for sustainable growth, with our drive for the transition to a sustainable low-carbon world serving as a core strategic pillar.

# Risk

Adopting a robust and holistic approach in the management of ESG factors is sound risk management. From credit and operational to regulatory and reputational risks, we understand the critical role that ESG risk management plays in building a resilient organisation.

# Responsibility

Meaningfully contributing to a sustainable future is simply the responsible thing to do. As a financial institution with a comprehensive coverage in ASEAN and Greater China, OCBC is well-positioned to be a catalyst of change, mobilising our expertise and resources and partnering our clients to address the pervasive environmental, social and developmental challenges of our time.

# WHAT sustainability means for OCBC

As a financial institution, we are clear on the role we can play to make a difference and are focused on our “ABC” sustainability imperatives.

# Accelerating the transition to a net-zero future

As a financial institution that is a connector of capital, we recognise the critical enabling role that we play in the journey towards a net-zero future. Our aim is to enable our clients’ transition through strategic advisory, innovative financial solutions and ecosystem partnerships across our multifaceted businesses.

# Bringing impact to communities

We believe that we can bring impact and meaningfully contribute towards the sustainable development of our communities as well as the wellbeing and flourishing of our people. Our aim is to create a dynamic workplace and society through championing people development and community advancement.

# Conducting our business responsibly

Effective stewardship and corporate governance is the bedrock of our stakeholders’ trust in us and our duty as a responsible corporate citizen. Our aim is to safeguard long-term stakeholder value through embedding responsible business practices and strong governance.

# HOW we deliver

# Driving progress on material ESG factors

The execution of our sustainability efforts is guided by our material ESG factors. By effectively managing these risks and opportunities, driving performance and innovation, we can deliver on our strategic sustainability imperatives and create long-term value and growth.

# Pursuing a partnership-based approach

We pursue a vigorous partnership-based approach. We believe that a more sustainable world can be created as long as we are united with our clients and communities in pursuing one. Collaboration is critical in addressing global sustainability challenges while partnerships are the most efficient way to magnify the impact of our individual actions and accelerate progress.

# Living our values

The foundation of our sustainability framework is our values of Lasting Value, Integrity, Forward-looking, Respect and Responsibility. Serving as our compass, it guides us to embed sustainability throughout the Group and enables us to harmonise our growth ambitions with our responsibility towards stakeholders and future generations. By integrating sustainability at the core of our business, we can achieve sustainable growth, deliver enduring value to our stakeholders and play our part in building a sustainable future.

Listening to those who journey with us

We place a high priority on understanding the insights and perspectives of our stakeholders, acknowledging their vital role in forging robust and enduring partnerships. The level of success for each sustainability initiative is correlated to the support and contribution of its stakeholders, which comprise customers, employees, investors, communities and regulators. By understanding the positive and negative impacts that our business has on our stakeholders, we aim to achieve a mutual understanding of expectations, both from our perspective and that of our stakeholders.

Through the various engagements with both our external and internal key stakeholder groups, we gain a deeper understanding of their diverse and evolving interests. Their invaluable inputs are instrumental in guiding our sustainability strategy, aiding in the determination of our material ESG factors as well as reporting of our sustainability performance and achievements.

# Our Materiality Assessment Process

Focusing on what matters In a dynamic ESG landscape, identifying relevant ESG factors is essential as they can have a significant impact and influence on banking performance and consequently impact the ability to create long-term value for stakeholders. At OCBC, we prioritise a long-term outlook and anchor our materiality assessment on a multi-stakeholder approach. We provide a holistic inside-out perspective on how our activities have an impact on the environment and society, and an outside-in perspective on how sustainability issues affect our business.

To fully assess the impact of the ESG factors on our stakeholders and operations, OCBC adopts a double materiality approach that captures both the financial and impact materiality of these factors. This double materiality approach not only provides us with a more holistic picture of the various financial risks and opportunities arising from each material factor, it also aids in identifying priority areas and integrating ESG risks and opportunities into our Group strategic planning and risk management processes.

In 2023, we engaged an external consultant to support our review and update of our material ESG factors and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). We conducted an examination of the relevance of each ESG factor on both our internal and external stakeholders and the impact of each ESG factor on them. This approach ensures a nuanced understanding, enabling strategic decision-making and effective risk management.

# What does materiality mean to OCBC?

# Financial Materiality

Significant impacts on the Bank’s prospects including its financial performance, financial position and cash flow.

# Impact Materiality

Significant impacts caused by the Bank on the environment and people.

The ESG factors were prioritised based on their financial and impact materiality, using the following criteria:

- Potential long-term value for our stakeholders
- Influence on decision-making process of key internal and external stakeholders
- Likelihood and impact to OCBC’s business strategies, financial planning, business model and outcomes, and business continuity
- Contributions to UN SDGs

# Our Materiality Assessment Process

The findings of the review were discussed and validated by the Sustainability Council before being presented to the Board for final approval. As we progress on our sustainability journey and our business context changes, we will regularly review our material ESG factors to ensure they remain updated and relevant.

# Our Materiality Assessment Process

Results of the Review As part of our Sustainability Framework review, we streamlined our material ESG factors to ensure a cohesive and impactful approach with our sustainability efforts. We merged certain factors sharing similar sustainability contexts and renamed some factors to better reflect the Bank’s priorities.

Community Development covers the potential impact of the Bank’s operations on the wider community. Given that Financial Inclusion forms an element of this impact on the wider community, it was merged with Community Development.

Employee Health, Safety and Wellbeing and Talent Management have been combined into one material ESG factor – Talent Management and Wellbeing as there are interlinkages between the two material topics. Economic Contribution was removed as standalone factor as its impact features across several other material ESG factors.

Our updated material ESG factors were endorsed by the Sustainability Council and subsequently approved by the Board Sustainability Committee. As a result, we streamlined the 13 material ESG factors to a total of 10 material ESG factors and organised them within three sustainability imperatives.

Along with the effort to streamline material ESG factors to reflect OCBC’s priorities, we also reviewed the UN SDGs in relation to OCBC’s activities and initiatives. The Bank will focus on six UN SDGs where we can make the greatest positive impact in our core markets and create long-term value for our stakeholders. Read more in our UN SDG Content Index on page 91.

# Selected UN SDGs

The material ESG factors and selected UN SDGs identified guide the implementation of our ongoing ESG efforts in 2023. Our achievements and progress made throughout the year are presented in the three sections according to three sustainability imperatives: Accelerating the transition to a net-zero future, Bringing impact to communities and Conducting our business responsibly.

OCBC recognises the critical role we play in influencing our clients’ transition efforts and mobilising resources to actively support them in order to move us towards a sustainable and resilient future.

warming to 1.5°C. Our complete methodology, selection of pathways and target-setting approach be found in our net-zero publication: Partnering Clients towards a Net Zero ASEAN and Greater China.(2)

In May 2023, OCBC announced our first net-zero targets, articulating our expectations for our clients in emission-intensive sectors on their transition and our broad transition engagement plans for six priority sectors – Power, Oil & Gas, Real Estate, Steel, Aviation and Shipping. The targets are guided by robust decarbonisation pathways geared towards achieving a net-zero level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while limiting global.

# Our Net-Zero Progress Update

As a Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) signatory,(3) we are committed to disclosing our progress on the net-zero targets every year. We are pleased with the good progress made in the first year for each sector. It is noteworthy that we have reduced the absolute emissions in the Oil & Gas sector and the emissions intensity of the remaining five sectors.

# Power

The global outlook for the power sector shows a consistent increase in energy demand, especially in Asia, where it is expected to account for half of the world’s electricity consumption by 2025.(5) Following a similar trend, Southeast Asia’s energy demand is expected to increase by 60% by 2040 compared to the baseline of 2018. This will necessitate a concerted effort to upscale the deployment of renewables to meet the growing energy demand.(6) In 2023, the global renewable energy capacity observed a 50% surge to nearly 510 GW, with solar photovoltaic (PV) driving 75% of this growth, signalling a positive stride towards transitioning away from fossil fuels. However, gaps in existing policies and market conditions must be closed to achieve the COP28 goal of tripling renewables by 2030 and to meet the increasing energy demand.(7)

In 2022, our Power sector’s financed emissions intensity saw a reduction of 9% from the baseline of 370 kgCO/MWh to 337 kgCO2/MWh. This outcome was only possible because of the continuous engagement with our clients in their transition journey, as well as in increasing our renewable energy portfolio. Through our active engagements, we helped our clients to understand and navigate the potential challenges to successfully expand their renewable energy business as well as improving their operational efficiency. These intensified efforts have resulted in the overall reduction of the emission intensity of our portfolio for the integrated power generation clients by 6%.

Climate Action: Our Net-Zero Commitment

Expansion of renewable energy capacity is a key driver for us; therefore, we continue to expand our renewable energy financing, venturing to new markets and supporting new technologies. While several renewable energy generation technologies such as solar and wind are already relatively mature, the challenge lies in scaling deployment of these technologies at the scale and speed required in the 1.5°C-aligned transition. Acknowledging headwinds such as intermittency, storage and grid infrastructure constraints, we remain committed to directing capital toward technologies that facilitate the significant scaling up of renewable energy and its supporting infrastructure.

While we are supporting clean energy deployment and business transition, the fact remains that 60% of the electricity in Asia is generated from coal, with almost seven million people employed in the coal value chain.9 Notwithstanding that, since 2019, we do not provide new financing or refinancing for coal-fired power plants and have expanded the prohibition over the years. We recognise that a net-zero future is not viable without first addressing existing coal assets in this region. To contribute to the industry’s efforts in tackling this complex challenge, OCBC joined TRACTION (Transition Credits Coalition), a coalition convened by the MAS to explore commercially viable ways to finance the early retirement of coal-fired power plants.

# Taiwan solar project: Floating solar project in Taiwan’s Changhua Coastal Industrial Park.

# Supporting new technologies

Solar project in Taiwan 2023 marked the launch of a pioneering 192 MW floating solar project in Taiwan’s Changhua Coastal Industrial Park. Operating in saline water, this initiative differs from the conventional freshwater reservoir-based systems. Our project showcases technological versatility and paves the way for numerous regional opportunities, notably across Asia. The project’s unique setting and technology represent a significant step forward in the renewable energy sector.

# Connecting the dots

SME Solar programme To incentivise building owners to install solar panels, the economics must make sense and the process needs to be straightforward. This is why OCBC developed the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) Solar Programme which provides financing directly to solar providers secured against their Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). This helps diversify the income stream for the solar provider while removing the upfront capital burden on building owners. This encourages the switch to more cost-effective renewable energy and empowers businesses to scale their impact. The programme has financed nearly 80 projects within the ASEAN region, contributing to 53 MWp of installed capacity. Our solutions help remove barriers to solar projects by connecting project installers and operators, and by allowing our clients, including SMEs, to access financing for their rooftop solar PV systems.

# Oil & Gas

The international energy crisis has brought energy security to the forefront of policy discussions. Global oil demand has increased from 99.4 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2022, to 101.7 mb/d in 2023, and is expected to reach 102.8 mb/d in 2024.(10) However, this rising trend is starting to slow down. By 2030, gas demand is expected to increase as it serves as a transitional fuel, potentially leading to a decrease in coal consumption.

The transition from fossil fuels to alternative, cleaner energy sources is crucial to achieving net-zero emissions. New technologies and solutions are constantly being developed to reduce GHG emissions, which will help accelerate the transition efforts. However, with the parallel importance of ensuring energy security amid market volatility, we need to ensure an orderly transition away from the burning of oil and gas in order to provide a resilient long-term solution.

|---|---|---|
|2021|14.9(11)|Baseline|
|2022| |12.1|

Co-creating innovative sustainable solutions with businesses OCBC partnered with TotalEnergies in the OCBC Sustainability Innovation Challenge (OSIC) 2023, focused on the transition to sustainable energy.

Now in its second edition, the OSIC aims to co-create innovative sustainable solutions with businesses, while providing aspiring solutions providers with a platform to showcase and scale their innovations. This year’s challenge saw close to 90 submissions from 27 countries, responding to the four challenge statements issued by TotalEnergies. The challenge statements were focused on renewable energy and sustainable mobility, as these are critical sectors driving the energy transition and mitigating climate change:

The three winners of the OSIC are Nunam Technologies’ second-life battery solution that repurposes used EV batteries as energy storage solutions, Bia Power’s smart charging algorithm that monitors, plans and optimises EV charging loads, and Pili Seal’s industrial-grade 2-in-1 sealant adhesive, Pili Seal, developed from spent pili resin, a by-product of the hydrodistillation of Pili tree sap. The winners of the OSIC will begin piloting their solutions with TotalEnergies in the first half of 2024; they will be fast-tracked into the final jury phase of TotalEnergies On, the company’s start-up accelerator programme dedicated to electricity businesses at Paris-based STATION F – the largest start-up campus in the world.

1. Repurpose electric vehicle (EV) batteries for safe redeployment in new applications.
2. Increase the penetration of distributed generation systems in Asia.
3. Develop cost-effective solutions integrating renewable energy sources to increase the efficiency of EV charging infrastructure.
4. Develop greener raw materials for manufacturing.

# Real Estate

Our core markets will see a significant growth of real estate assets with the continuation of rapid urbanisation taking place within Asia. While this poses great environmental challenges, there are opportunities for our Real Estate clients to do well by doing good. OCBC has set a clear and credible transition pathway for the sector and our clients.

# Our Approach

For the Real Estate sector, we have used an Alignment Delta (AD) metric to reflect the highly heterogeneous nature of the sector. A hotel in Hong Kong has a different emissions profile compared to a retail mall in Singapore, and as such are not directly comparable. Using AD ensures each asset is compared with its own reference pathway, which takes into account asset type and location.

# Our Progress

|Year|OCBC vs CRREM|OCBC Position|
|---|---|---|
|2021|-5.3%(13)|Baseline|
|2022|-1.4%| |
|2030|≤0%| |
|2050|≤0%| |

Our portfolio analysis uses both direct data and national statistics. In 2022, our portfolio AD was -1.4%, which means our portfolio is performing better than the reference pathway as a whole. This is testament to our proactive approach to financing greener and more efficient buildings.

# Supporting our Clients

Guided by our streamlined decarbonisation toolbox, we have initiated critical measures focusing on new and existing buildings, accelerating building electrification and energy transition, while mitigating other GHG emissions. These strategic actions are fundamental to driving early-stage decarbonisation within the sector.

Republic Plaza, CDL’s flagship development in the heart of Singapore’s central business district.

OCBC supported Katong Holdings in achieving the BCA Green Mark 2021 Platinum rating for Katong Square.

# Partnering in 1.5°C alignment

For the world to successfully transition to net zero, businesses need to set ambitious, rigorous targets and follow through with strong initiatives to reduce emissions and measure progress. OCBC introduced the OCBC 1.5°C loan, offering corporates a reduced interest rate on their loans when they meet or exceed carbon emissions reduction targets aligned with internationally recognised, science-based net-zero decarbonisation pathways.

In 2023, OCBC worked with City Developments Limited (CDL) to deliver its first 1.5°C net-zero-aligned corporate loan. The three-year GBP 200 million sustainability-linked loan reflects CDL’s commitment to decarbonising its business via its initial net-zero carbon target by 2030 for new and existing wholly-owned assets and developments under its direct operational and management control. As part of the loan terms, CDL will enjoy interest rate reductions upon meeting the pre-agreed annual decarbonisation performance targets, in line with CDL’s Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-validated targets. These include a reduction in GHG emissions intensity by 63% per square metre leased area (Scope 1 and 2), 41% per square metre gross floor area (Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services) and 58.8% including hotels managed by CDL’s wholly-owned hotel subsidiary, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (Scope 3 GHG emissions from investments), against its 2016 baseline, by 2030.

# From advisory to action

OCBC provided finance with technical green building advice to Katong Holdings to achieve the BCA Green Mark 2021 Platinum rating for Katong Square, a development that consists of two hotel towers and a retail area.

OCBC had partnered the client in its sustainability journey, rendering not only financial support but also technical and trusted green building advisory for their properties. The client took on board OCBC’s optimisation recommendations which allowed them to improve their air conditioning system efficiency, improve their operational performance and give them the boost they needed to meet the new and higher Green Mark certification standards.

This showcases the seamless integration of OCBC’s leading sustainability and transition advisory with our financing solutions designed to support our clients in their sustainability journeys.

The OCBC 1.5°C loan reflects OCBC’s longstanding commitment to support its clients on their net-zero journeys. The insights gained from working with corporates that take up the OCBC 1.5°C loan will help the Bank better support their transition plans with suitable advisory and financing solutions.

# Steel

Steel is one of the key building blocks of urbanisation and the modern economy. In the past decade, China has had the largest share of world’s crude steel production (c.54% as of 2022) as well as the greatest steel demand (c.52% of the global total).(14)

# Our Approach

For the Steel sector, we have selected a physical emissions intensity target to reduce the CO2 emissions intensity associated with steel manufacturing (tCO/tSteel) to support growing demand for steel while encouraging lower-emissions production processes.

# Our Progress

|Year|Reference|OCBC Targets|OCBC Position|
|---|---|---|---|
|2021|1.95| |1.93|
|2022| | |1.76|
|2030|1.68|1.68| |
|2050|0.12|0.12| |

Our 2022 financed emissions intensity for the Steel sector reduced by 8% from our baseline of 1.93 tCO/tSteel to 1.76 tCO2/tSteel.

The decrease in financed emission intensity is a result of a strategic shift in our exposure, tilting our overall steel portfolio towards clients with well-defined transition plans and lower emissions intensity per tonne of steel produced. The reduction in emission intensity can also be attributed to steel producers in our key markets moving towards lower-carbon steel production, national grid decarbonisation, or a combination of both.

The solution for decarbonising the Steel sector will be centred around recycling of scrap steel and adopting cleaner, less carbon-intensive production technologies such as Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and green hydrogen. The decarbonisation of energy grids around the world will be another powerful enabler for the transition of the Steel sector.

We are committed to directing capital to low-carbon steel production and working with our clients to prepare for a more circular, less carbon-intensive Steel sector that is aligned with the goals under the Paris Agreement. In particular, we will continue to improve data availability, which will enhance the quality of and confidence in our financed emission data.

Supporting innovation to close the loop. We recognise that the transition of steel producers is crucial, and hence the need for solutions to increase steel production efficiency, promote reuse, and lower recycling barriers. In line with this, we have provided support to Mlion Corporation (Mlion) through a sustainability-linked loan. This support aims to facilitate Mlion’s continued growth and development of market innovations within the steel industry.

Mlion is one of the region’s largest suppliers of steel material for the construction of infrastructure (including roads, bridges, ports and waterways), and underground structures. One of its core products is sheet piles, which are used in retaining walls. To improve steel use efficiency, Mlion has engineered Mlion Hot Rolled (MHZ) sheet piles, which use 20% less steel in the manufacturing process compared to traditional sheet piles. These sheet piles are made of high tensile steel, resulting in increased durability and reusability, contributing to the circularity of the product line.

However, challenges exist in ensuring the reuse of sheet piles. Often, they are left in the ground after foundations are completed or scrapped prematurely. To tackle this issue, Mlion developed and launched two industry solutions in 2023:

- GoListid: This business-to-business (B2B) steel marketplace matches the supply of pre-owned steel materials with those in need, reducing the premature scrapping of perfectly reusable steel products. This eliminates the need for new steel production.
- GoTagID: This tagging solution reduces barriers to recycling and reuse of steel products, particularly structural steel materials. It enables the tracing of data such as steel composition, past inspections and test results, and location tracking of steel members. This allows for retrievability and verification of materials for reuse.

GoTagID solution promotes reusability of steel products and simplifies the recycling processes.

Mlion exemplifies the approach that we champion with our clients across all sectors. They focus on developing innovative solutions to industry issues, supported by our own innovative financial sustainability and transition solutions.

# Aviation

The global volume of air travel is expected to finally exceed pre-Covid levels in 2024 as the Asia Pacific region makes a full recovery(15). In the long run, global passenger traffic looks set to double by 2040(16).

With this rapid growth and the sizeable emissions footprint, we have to harness the power of innovation and collaboration to develop cleaner ways of flying. This includes scaling the switch to alternative fuels and developing increasingly efficient aircraft for the sector to continue being a catalyst for global connectivity and socio-economic growth.

# Our Approach

A key priority for the Aviation sector is to increase the production and consumption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The regulatory push from the EU for all aircraft at EU airports to use a minimum share of 2% SAF starting in 2025 and increasing it every five years to achieve 70% by 2050 will accelerate SAF adoption efforts.

In 2022, we remained on track to meet our 2030 interim target, achieving a financed emissions intensity of 0.097 kgCO2/passenger-km. Our 2022 financed emissions intensity saw a significant improvement from our 2021 baseline, with a reduction of 63% from 0.261 kgCO2/passenger-km to 0.097 kgCO2/passenger-km. This sets us in line with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Fly Net Zero reference pathway, putting us on track to achieve our target of 0.088 kgCO2/passenger-km by 2030. The significant improvement reflects the rebound of this sector as the Covid restrictions have eased and passenger loads have since increased.

|2030|0.088|0.088| |
|2050|0| | |

Despite the positive development in 2022, decarbonisation in the Aviation sector remains challenging, due to lack of commercially viable decarbonisation solutions that the industry can adopt immediately. We remain confident in our clients’ decarbonisation efforts as many of them are already adopting or have committed to adopt these actions:

- Increasing the use of SAF
- Renewing aircraft fleets to younger fleets that are more fuel efficient
- Retrofitting older aircraft to improve fuel efficiency
- Reconfiguring aircraft operations to improve efficiency, such as by optimising flight routes
- Voluntarily participating in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) before mandatory implementation of the scheme

We will continue to work with our clients to implement further measures to reduce their emissions.

# Shipping

Ships carry 90% of the world’s trade,(17) with global freight demand expected to triple by 2050.(18) The shipping sector contributes around 3% of all global GHG emissions,(19) with 99% of energy demand from the sector still met by oil products today.(20)

Most significantly in 2023, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) revised its GHG reduction strategy in July,(21) aiming to reduce the GHG emissions levels to net zero by or around 2050, which is aligned with the well-below 2°C scenario of the Paris Agreement. The updated strategy expands the scope of the GHG emissions reduction target, to well-to-wake emissions,(22) and introduced a new target to increase the uptake of zero or near-zero GHG emissions fuels. This move was welcomed by PP signatories, among whom OCBC remains the only Singapore bank.

In 2022, our portfolio outperformed the initial trajectory. While the revised trajectory reflects the industry’s ambition to achieve net zero, in our first assessment, we are pleased to share that we are one of the top four signatories globally in terms of alignment and the top in Asia.

# Our Progress

|Year|OCBC vs IMO – PP|OCBC Position|
|---|---|---|
|2021|+4.5%|Baseline|
|2022|-2.7% (previous trajectory)|+11.2% (revised trajectory)|
|2030|≤0%| |
|2050|≤0%| |

In 2022, we made substantial improvement in our Shipping portfolio AD from our +4.5% 2021 baseline to -2.7%, which is better than the reference pathway. This is partly attributed to the normalisation of markets from the effects of Covid towards the end of 2022, especially in the Container segment. In 2022, we remain committed to our clients as they renew their shipping fleets in preparation for the transition to low-carbon fuels. The majority of the new vessels that we now finance are dual-fuel vessels. Our active engagement with clients has contributed to our clients’ ongoing efforts to improve their AER by upgrading their vessels and adopting newer technologies and low-carbon fuels.

In July 2023, the IMO revised its Strategy on Reduction of GHG emissions from ships, and as a signatory, we will disclose our progress on transition using the revised trajectories as well. Our updated progress can also be found in the Poseidon Principles Annual Disclosure Report 2023.

This is not without challenges, as it is dependent on the availability of commercially viable low-carbon alternatives in the sector. The maritime sector is still in a transitional phase and we will ensure our strategic efforts are adaptable and robust in the face of evolving industry standards and technological advancements.

# Singapore’s first all-electric crew transfer vessel

We are proud to finance Yinson GreenTech in developing the prototype of Singapore’s first all-electric crew transfer vessel, the Hydroglyder, which is now undergoing sea trials in Singapore. The Hydroglyder is equipped with an advanced hydrofoil system which provides better energy efficiency as compared to traditional electric vessels of a similar size. The onboard batteries provide power to propel the vessel while the flight control system maintains the stability of the craft during foiling. This is expected to reduce operational costs by up to 90%, while reducing the maritime industry’s carbon footprint and local particulate air pollution. Our role in this project underscores our commitment to championing green technologies and aligns with our strategic goal of driving decarbonisation in the maritime sector.

# Steering towards sustainability

In 2023, OCBC contributed to two of Cadeler’s green loans. Cadeler is a supplier in the offshore wind energy industry. The EUR 550 million green loan will be utilised for the refinancing of Cadeler and Eneti’s existing vessels, Cadeler’s two existing vessel’s crane upgrades, and for general working capital, while the EUR 425 million green loan will be used to finance Cadeler’s two newbuilds, Wind Peak and Wind Pace. The green loans are structured in accordance with Cadeler’s Green Finance Framework, which has obtained a Second Party Opinion by S&P Global. The green loans secure Cadeler’s vision in accelerating the renewable transition, cementing their position as a global leader in offshore wind installation in the market.

# Climate Action: Managing our Climate-Related Risks

Our ability to manage climate-related risks impacting the Bank is crucial and inextricably linked to supporting climate mitigation and adaptation efforts in the real economy. Given the cross-cutting nature of climate risk, we adopt an integrated and risk-based approach, prioritising the management of climate risks of greater likelihood and impact while closely monitoring interconnections between various risk types.

# Identifying our Climate-Related Risks

Climate change presents financial and reputational risks, impacting our business directly and indirectly. It can amplify traditional banking risks, including credit, market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks. We conduct our materiality assessment regularly to ensure it stays relevant, tapping on the growing knowledge and evidence base for climate risk. This ensures that risk drivers that impact the Group across the various risks are adequately identified, assessed and managed in accordance with our existing risk management approaches and planning horizon. Our assessment indicates that credit and reputational implications from climate risks are likely to be more material than other traditional risks.

# Portfolio-level Risk Management

We prioritise managing ESG and climate-related credit and reputational risks from our wholesale lending activities through integrating these considerations in our Responsible Financing Framework and Policies and credit approval processes.

Specifically for credit risk, we have built a suite of climate models to assess the impacts of transition and physical risks on the Bank’s credit portfolios. We also monitor and report on credit exposures to climate-relevant sectors (oil and gas, power generation, metals and mining, chemicals, transportation, agriculture, other energy-intensive manufacturing, and real estate) to our management and board on a periodic basis, to enhance our understanding of climate risk impact on our portfolio.

While sectors of the economy are exposed to the net-zero transition and physical hazards, clients in the carbon-intensive and hard-to-abate sectors are more exposed to transition risks. We focus our decarbonisation efforts on six sectors – Power, Oil & Gas, Real Estate, Steel, Aviation, and Shipping – that we have set net-zero targets for. We also enhanced sector prohibitions to cease project financing to upstream Oil & Gas projects that obtained approval for development after 31 December 2021.

# Client-level Risk management

ESG and climate-related risk assessment is undertaken as part of clients’ overall credit risk assessment process. High-risk clients or transactions where significant environmental and social risks are identified and referred to a dedicated team of ESG specialists for enhanced due diligence and no objection review. Those with significant ESG risks that cannot be mitigated may be turned down. Clients or transactions with significant reputational risk will be escalated to the Reputational Risk Review Group for clearance. All transactions must be approved by the relevant Credit Approval authority.

In line with our risk-based approach, we have started to assess and engage clients in selected sectors on their ability to manage their climate-related transition and physical risks, in addition to ESG risks. Please refer to our Responsible Financing chapter for more information on our Responsible Financing Framework and Policies.

# Other Risk Types

For market, liquidity and operational risks, climate risk materiality assessments are carried out to identify implications of transition and physical risks on trading activities, asset and liability management, and operational resilience. This will help us identify the types of activities and operations that may be affected and warrant deeper assessments and mitigation actions to be taken.

Our assessment on market risk is that the impact on our exposures is limited for climate-relevant sectors. Adverse impact is also moderated by the short-dated nature of such exposures.

On liquidity risks, our assessment has indicated that our liquidity buffers will remain resilient under assessed climate transition stress scenarios. As we move forward, we will continue to study best practices in this area and enhance our assessment approach.

For operational risks, our focus is on understanding the consequences of physical risk events on operational resilience. We have assessed that our existing measures can adequately mitigate the impact of existing physical risk events on our people, processes and systems. Nevertheless, we recognise that physical risks are likely to increase in frequency and severity in the long term and will be developing a framework to identify changing climate risks and ensure that the measures remain fit-for-purpose.

# Climate Action: Managing our Climate-Related Risks

In tandem with growing scientific consensus on the interlinkages between climate, nature and biodiversity, the Bank has taken steps to enhance our assessment and management of nature and biodiversity risks.

At the outset, our Responsible Financing Policies prohibit financing of projects that have an adverse impact on nature and biodiversity. More details on our agriculture and forestry sectoral policy can be found in the Responsible Financing chapter.

Within our ESG risk assessments, we have also embedded considerations to assess clients on the impact of their activities on the protection and conservation of biodiversity, water stewardship, minimising of footprint and restoring ecosystems.

Going forward, we will enhance our understanding of nature-related financial risks. This follows from the Bank’s participation in the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework pilot study on assessing nature-related risks and opportunities related to the palm oil sector.

# Climate-related Risk Drivers(24)

|Risk Types|Potential Financial Risk Impacts for Each Risk Type|
|---|---|
|Transition Risk Drivers|• Repayment capacity of clients impacted by transition risks (e.g. change in consumer demand, increase in costs due to carbon pricing) or physical risks causing business disruptions • Collateral values impacted by rising frequency and intensity of physical risk events, leading to asset stranding, reduced balance sheet, strength of obligors, and reduced recovery from potential defaults|
|Market Risk|• Decline in market valuation of securities due to disruptive transition events (e.g. sudden climate policy shifts) or severe physical risk events (e.g. major flooding)|
|Liquidity Risk|• Material change in cash outflows due to climate-induced risk events or adverse reputational events • Reduction in liquid assets due to climate-induced macroeconomic stresses|
|Operational Risk|• Increase in frequency and severity of acute physical risk events, which can affect physical assets, cause business interruptions and pose workplace health and safety challenges|
|Reputational Risk|• Reputational issues associated with stakeholder perceptions on adequacy of climate risk and opportunity management|

Climate Scenario Analysis

Climate scenario analysis serves to facilitate our understanding of risks and opportunities associated with climate change under a range of hypothetical scenarios spanning multiple time periods.

In 2022, we updated our climate scenario analysis methodology to capture the combined impacts of both transition and physical risks to eight climate relevant sectors (oil and gas, power generation, metals and mining, chemicals, transportation, agriculture, other energy-intensive manufacturing, and real estate) using a suite of climate scenario analysis models.

These climate scenario analysis models adopt a bottom-up approach to translate key scenario parameters (e.g. emission intensity pathways, carbon price, fossil fuel price and demand, electricity price and demand, physical hazard frequency and severity) into drivers of business performance such as volume, unit cost, price and capital expenditure. The credit rating impacts are then estimated using the adjusted financial statements.

Leveraging on these models, we analysed the impacts on our credit portfolio using reference scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), i.e. the Net Zero 2050 (Orderly Transition), Delayed Transition (Disorderly Transition) and Current Policies scenarios.

These scenarios were selected to cover three dimensions in the NGFS Climate Scenarios for Central Banks and Supervisors. This ensures that our scenario analysis accounts for a wide range of climate outcomes representing varying levels of risk to the Bank.

# Enhancement to Climate Scenario Analysis

In 2023, we enhanced the methodology for the Real Estate sector to incorporate capital expenditure relating to mandatory or voluntary retrofitting costs required to improve energy efficiency of assets.

Separately, we also conducted a short-term climate scenario analysis as part of the Bank’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Climate Risk Stress Test 2023. To assess the impacts of short-term physical risk events in these exercises, we identified property collaterals in at-risk areas using geo-locational information (e.g. postal codes, building/street addresses, flood maps) from government or meteorological authorities. Credit impacts arising from potential property devaluation due to asset damages and/or shifts in consumer preferences were assessed.

# Results from Climate Scenario Analysis

The scenario analysis results showed that sectors that are carbon-intensive and hard-to-abate would be most impacted under the Orderly and Disorderly Transition scenarios. The high transition risk sectors include upstream and integrated oil and gas, coal mining, conventional power generation, steel and cement manufacturing and aviation, though the impacts are more significant in the medium- to long-term. We have since started regular monitoring and reporting of exposures to these sectors.

Limitations of Climate Scenario Analysis Methodology

It is important to view the scenarios not as future forecasts but hypothetical constructs to understand the nature and magnitude of risks across a range of plausible climate and policy pathways. This would help us prepare for the risks and opportunities that could arise across various sectors and geographies relevant to our credit portfolio.

Although we have strengthened our climate scenario analysis methodology and understanding progressively, the results should be interpreted with the following methodological limitations in mind:

# Building Resilience into Our Business Model

We acknowledge that our portfolio faces climate risks and recognise the impact of our lending decisions on the climate through financing. Our net-zero strategy actively aligns the portfolio with a 2050 commitment, setting ambitious decarbonisation targets, particularly for financed emissions. Through partnerships with clients, we actively support sectors in planning effective transitions for decarbonisation and sustainability. More information on our target-setting methodology and selection of key sectors can be found in our net-zero publication: Partnering Clients towards a Net Zero ASEAN and Greater China.

1. Extent of assumptions – Due to uncertainty in extended projection timeframe, a large set of assumptions is used.
2. Relevance of scenario parameters – Climate risk scenarios and parameters from various international think tanks and research bodies are often provided and calibrated at a certain level of granularity which may not fully reflect local market dynamics and constraints.
3. Availability and consistency of data – Company-level emissions and business activity data may not be available or consistent across companies or sectors.

In our journey to a low-carbon world, responsible financing and sustainable solutions play pivotal roles. We have proactively tightened lending policies to shift away from fossil fuel consumption, including enforcing enhanced coal-related prohibitions. In 2021, we committed to growing our sustainable finance portfolio to $50 billion by 2025 and we have surpassed the target ahead of schedule. More information on our Responsible Financing can be found on page 39 and Sustainable Financial Solutions can be found on page 43.

Absence of company- and country-level transition plans and measures – Such transition plans may not be disclosed and it may be too complex to incorporate granular information at scale.

We remain committed to keeping abreast of developments in this area and continually enhancing our methodology in line with industry standards.

# Climate Action: Managing our Environmental Footprint

As we support our clients’ net-zero transition and their aspirations for a low-carbon world, we also prioritise aligning our operations with sustainability principles to safeguard the vital ecosystem supporting life on Earth and minimising our environmental impact.

We are committed to reducing the environmental footprint of our physical operations by reducing our consumption of energy, water, paper and other resources. To reduce our environmental impact, three key approaches have been identified:

- Improving building energy efficiency with technology and management practices
- Exploring innovative solutions to push boundaries
- Enhancing sustainability through strategic collaboration

# Maintaining Carbon Neutrality

In 2023, we met our target of achieving carbon neutrality for OCBC’s banking operational emissions through a hierarchy of priorities:

|Priority 1:|Reducing Energy Consumption from our Operations|
|---|---|
|Priority 2:|Increasing Renewable Energy Adoption|
|Priority 3:|Responsible Purchase of Carbon Credits to Offset Residual and Unavoidable Emissions|

We are consistently prioritising the deployment of sustainable technologies, optimising building system efficiency and exploring innovative solutions for Group-owned properties. Since 2020, reducing energy consumption from our operations has been our immediate key agenda. A portfolio-wide energy audit has been conducted across our buildings, supporting the deployment of several data-driven energy optimisations.

Building equipment is progressively replaced with best-in-class energy efficiency options where feasible. Exploration of innovative technology is also intensified to supplement the drive to reduce energy consumption (e.g. deployment of Passive Heat removal technology at our data centre in 2022).

These approaches and priorities underscore our commitment to comprehensive sustainability and environmental responsibility.

# Climate Action: Managing our Environmental Footprint

Significantly, scope 3 emissions have risen from 2022, which can be attributed to the post-pandemic recovery in air travel. This recovery has led to an increase in the number of business air travels made in 2023. Going forward, we remain dedicated to improving our progress in fostering sustainability within our operations.

# Improving Building Energy Efficiency with Technology and Management Practices

In 2023, we continued the post-pandemic recovery of our office occupancy, directly increasing the energy requirements of our buildings. We have sustained the optimisation of our building to reduce the impact. In Malaysia, we successfully completed the retrofitting of lights at all our offices in Wisma Lee Rubber and Menara OCBC. Across the region, we also completed the installation of solar panels covering 27,000 square feet across several of our buildings, notably on the rooftops of OCBC Centre Tampines One and Two, OCBC Centre (Shanghai) and OCBC Space (Indonesia).

# Pilot project: Installation of ceramic nets on Air Handling Units (AHUs) and smart optimisation of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system (chiller plant) operations

# Ceramic nets implementation

The implementation of ceramic nets was piloted at OCBC Tampines Centre One. The nets optimise heat exchange through breaking up of water molecule clusters. The first phase of implementation was done at the AHU on a single level to determine the nets’ effectiveness in reducing the air conditioning cooling load. With promising results from the pilot, we have since implemented the nets in all the AHUs of the building.

# Implementation of ceramic nets at OCBC Tampines Centre One.

# Installation of solar panels on OCBC Tampines Centre Two (left) and OCBC Centre (China) (right).

In tandem with our Singapore branch refurbishment plan, energy efficiency optimisation is also progressively implemented at our 32 branches.

# HVAC optimisation

Smart Building HVAC optimisation uses historical data, real-time data collected and machine learning to achieve a holistic system efficiency improvement and allow HVAC systems to always work at peak efficiency.

In 2023, two of our branches – Wisma and Tampines – have attained the Green Mark Platinum certification, bringing our total certified branches to 8 out of 32 branches.

# Exploring Innovative Solutions to Push Boundaries

While actively promoting building energy efficiency through lifecycle equipment replacement and operational optimisation, we recognise that conventional methods have almost reached saturation. Therefore, in 2023, we intensified our focus on innovation and embarked on two pilot projects to ascertain carbon reduction potential and scalability. One project actively utilises material properties to ionise and break up water molecules, enhancing heat transfer efficiency in our indoor air environment. The other actively leverages the smart Internet of Things (IoT) to optimise our building’s air conditioning system. Both projects demonstrated significant carbon reduction potential, prompting active exploration for scaling up across our assets.

# Performance dashboard used for HVAC optimisation.

In the second half of 2023, we started a pilot implementation for HVAC optimisation at our building to assess its viability and feasibility for our operations. While the initial findings from both projects have been promising, we are continually monitoring and assessing their performance with the aim of scaling up across our assets.

Enhancing Sustainability Through Strategic Collaboration

Together with the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Singapore, we curated a series of sustainable real estate management workshops and seminars with our key stakeholders in mind. The workshops and seminars were open to employees and tenants leasing spaces within our properties. Through this, we aim to grow with our ecosystem stakeholders, actively enhancing our capacity and expertise to decarbonise.

# Going Forward

Given the existential nature of climate change and the urgent need to substantially reduce emissions, the transition to a net-zero future remains a key priority for us. We will continue to manage our environmental footprint.

# Our Forthcoming Targets

- Achieve net zero in financed emissions for six sectors by 2050
- Maintain carbon neutrality for OCBC’s banking operational emissions in 2024
- Receive BCA Green Mark award for all OCBC Bank Singapore branches by 2030
- Provide electric vehicle charging facilities to major Group-owned commercial buildings by 2025

In a strategic collaboration, OCBC entered into a partnership with the SGBC to drive the adoption of sustainability in the real estate sector. One of the key outcomes of this partnership is an issuance of challenge call to the industry for novel building technology that will further fuel the decarbonisation of the real estate sector. Successes from the challenge will be shared within SGBC’s network and OCBC’s client base, proliferating their adoption.

Tailored training is also designed for OCBC employees, clients and tenants to strengthen our combined capabilities and knowledge of decarbonisation. Through closer connections, green financing can be provided to member organisations under SGBC, facilitating and amplifying the deployment of sustainable solutions in the broader community.

# Why this is Material to Us

The escalating challenge of climate change and the critical imperative for sustainable development present a dual landscape of business risks and opportunities within the banking industry. As we navigate these evolving risks, particularly in the ESG domain, we prioritise effective ESG risk management and responsible lending practices to safeguard our businesses while contributing to a greener future.

# Our Management Approach

Our approach is rooted in the principles of risk management and responsible lending. We are cognisant of the significant impact our financing activities can have on the environment and society. We also recognise the diverse physical and transition risks that climate change poses to both our clients and the Bank’s portfolio. As such, our primary objective is to prudently navigate and mitigate these risks and provide a steadfast commitment to guide our clients towards the transition to a low-carbon economy, in alignment with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

This strategic focus goes beyond fulfilling our social responsibilities; it is also instrumental in mitigating the Bank’s exposure to climate-related risks and safeguarding the long-term value of our clients’ assets.

We are guided by our Responsible Financing Framework and Policies which outline OCBC’s approach and dedication to managing ESG risks within our lending practices. Our Framework and Policies detail our ESG-focused strategy for both lending and debt-related activities, encompassing debt issuance and underwriting, and applies to new and existing corporate, commercial, and institutional clients. We firmly adhere to a policy of non-engagement in any financing activities that are on our exclusion and prohibition lists where there is clear evidence of immitigable adverse impact to the environment, people or communities, or where there is a breach of local regulations.

See the table on the following page for key highlights of our major policies.

# Responsible Financing

# Our Policies

Responsible Financing

- Established to manage ESG risks in our credit decision process.
- By considering environmental and social risks, we will be better able to assess and advise our clients on their ESG risk exposure. This in turn allows us to better manage the Bank’s ESG risk exposure.

# Responsible Financing Sector-Specific Policies

- We are also guided by sector-specific policies that outline our requirements and expectations for clients in sectors with high risk of potential environmental and social impacts.
- Our Responsible Financing sector-specific policies cover all the sectors identified as high risk by The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) Responsible Financing Guidelines:

# Responsible Investing Policy

- Established to enhance returns and our risk-taking decisions by integrating ESG considerations into the Bank’s own investment activities.
- By investing responsibly and ensuring that our investment activities do not violate our ESG exclusions and prohibitions, the Bank is able to better fulfil our commitment towards sustainability and avoid supporting activities that may be harmful to the environment or society.

# Key Policy Enhancements in 2023

# Oil & Gas

To align with our net-zero objectives, we have enhanced sector prohibitions to cease project financing to upstream Oil & Gas projects that obtained approval for development after 2021. This enhancement is in addition to our existing prohibitions on financing coal-fired power plants and thermal coal mines.

# Agriculture & Forestry

In response to growing concerns around global land use change and the sustainability of food systems, we have broadened the scope of our Responsible Financing Policy for Agriculture & Forestry to encompass animal production and fisheries. We have also enhanced our expectations for palm planter clients to comply with the mandatory requirements under the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) and Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO), or the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

New plantations are required to demonstrate alignment to NDPE. For fishing activities, clients are expected to avoid drift net fishing using nets that are more than 2.5km in length as well as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

ESG Risk Assessment Process

Our ESG risk assessment process evaluates our clients’ track record along with their capacity and commitment to manage ESG factors and climate risk effectively. This assessment is an integral component of the credit and risk evaluation, undertaken by relationship managers and is reviewed annually. Transactions identified as having high ESG risk are subjected to enhanced due diligence through no objection review, while transactions that pose significant reputational risks are escalated to the Reputational Risk Review Group (RRRG) for additional review.

In 2023, over 8,500 transactions were assessed, with more than 300 necessitating enhanced due diligence. There were no escalations to the RRRG in 2023.

In addition, we have incorporated climate-related risk assessments across climate-relevant sectors. We assess the transition risk and physical risk, including their impact and time horizon, as well as the client’s carbon emissions targets and performance.

The Equator Principles serve as a framework for managing environmental and social risks, ensuring that project-related financing is developed in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. OCBC adopted the Equator Principles in 2020 and has since integrated them into our policy framework and ESG risk assessment process. In 2023, there were 10 transactions that reached financial close under the purview of the Equator Principles, as detailed in the table below.

Training and Capacity Building

Strengthening our internal capacity on ESG and climate-related risks remains a key focus. We conducted training and annual capacity building programmes for our people in relevant roles, such as client relationship management and credit risk management. For instance, we conducted training on our Responsible Financing Framework and Policies for employees enrolled in the Bank’s Credit Induction Programme (CIP). We also conducted Group-wide annual refresher training on the Bank’s ESG and climate risk assessments, and educated employees on the Equator Principles. These initiatives are complemented by sustainability-related risk management e-learning modules on topics such as the Equator Principles, as well as the OCBC Future Smart Programme, which provides a comprehensive suite of sustainability training courses for our employees.(2)

# Partnerships and Engagements

We will continue to engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including industry peers, regulatory authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), our employees and clients, to keep abreast of the latest advancements in responsible and sustainable financing, alongside climate risk management. In 2023, we participated in the consultation conducted by MAS on the proposed supervisory Guidelines on Transition Planning for financial institutions. This reflects our ongoing dedication to aligning with best practices in transition planning and risk management.

# Change and Principle-based Taxonomy (CCPT) Implementation Group

Our involvement in JC3 and the CCPT Implementation Group includes actively participating in discussions and supporting efforts surrounding the industry-wide implementation of the CCPT, as well as keeping abreast with the latest developments around the implementation of the Climate Risk Management and Scenario Analysis (CRMSA) Policy Document. In China, we collaborated with external technical expertise to uplift our knowledge on topics such as climate risk analysis and management, interpretation of green finance policies, disclosure and climate risk opportunities.

# Going Forward

Navigating the dual landscape of ESG risk and opportunities continues to be of paramount importance. Doing so requires deepening our understanding and capabilities in pertinent areas such as climate and nature risks. Only then can we continue to effectively safeguard our businesses and our stakeholders’ trust.

# Our Forthcoming Targets

- Enhance climate scenario analysis capabilities to keep pace with industry practices
- Complete high-level materiality mapping of nature-related risks to enhance our understanding of nature-risk implications

Moreover, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of courses addressing climate-related and nature-related risks provided by the Asia Sustainable Finance Initiative (ASFI). This review is part of our continuous efforts to support the capacity building of the industry.

Apart from our local partnerships and engagements with relevant industry stakeholders, we also actively engage various industry collaborations through our subsidiaries. In Malaysia, we are part of the Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Joint Committee on Climate Change (JC3) Sub-Committee on Risk Management and Climate.

Our Management Approach

We have been offering our customers sustainable and transition finance solutions across sectors as early as 2018. In 2023, we continued to expand our sustainable finance expertise across our key markets in Singapore, Malaysia and Greater China, offering our customers across the region bespoke transition engagement and financing solutions to enable their transition to a low-carbon future.

On the investments front, we make it our priority to understand our customers’ individual goals, needs and preferences. Our ESG product offerings are targeted at four different customer segments – high-net-worth individuals, retail customers, corporate clients and institutional clients.

To further engage our core leadership team in driving our sustainability agenda, our Global Consumer Financial Services (GCFS) division has extended our quarterly engagement sessions to include heads of departments and their team leads. This expansion allows us to effectively involve all departments, ensuring that sustainability is reviewed and integrated into their day-to-day operations. By doing so, we can execute our sustainability strategy more efficiently within each department and team.

# 1. Mobilising Capital to Support Our Clients’ Sustainability Development

We have been actively embedding sustainability considerations in the way we engage our clients. Leveraging on the knowledge obtained through our net-zero target-setting exercise, we have gained a better understanding of our clients’ challenges and opportunities in transitioning towards a net-zero future. This has enabled us to better support our clients with tailored transition financing solutions to meet their needs, providing them with the capital they need to achieve their climate aspirations.

In particular, expanding clean electricity generation is a crucial enabler for the transition of other sectors, such as transport and manufacturing. Global electricity demand is expected to grow at an accelerated pace, particularly in emerging countries, with Asia expected to account for half of the world’s electricity consumption by 2025.(3) To meet growing electricity demand and Southeast Asia’s national net-zero targets, the region will(3) need to add over 250 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2050. Aligned with the demands of a net-zero future, we continue to look for new opportunities to finance clean energy development in our key markets.

# Supporting the renewable energy supply chain with Chinese state-owned enterprise’s first green loan

OCBC was the mandated lead arranger, bookrunner and green loan advisor for China Universal Leasing Co (CULC)’s first RMB 400 million Green Syndicated Loan. CULC is a subsidiary of China General Technology Group (Genertec), a Chinese state-owned enterprise. The green facility is raised under CULC’s newly established Green Loan Framework, which will enable CULC to enter into multiple green loan transactions. The loan financed a 25 gigawatt (GW) high-efficiency ultra-thin Silicon Monocrystalline solar wafers manufacturing project; the wafers are crucial components for the manufacturing of solar photovoltaic systems.

# Supporting China’s largest wind farm operator with a maiden green loan

For some corporates, embarking on their ESG journey begins with establishing a framework to guide their holistic sustainable finance strategy. OCBC recognised that this was the first step for our client, Hero Asia Investment. Hero Asia is part of China Longyuan Power Group, China’s largest wind farm operator and part of the world’s largest power company by installed capacity.

Providing our expertise and support, we structured Hero Asia’s newly established Green Loan Framework, receiving high scores from S&P Global Ratings. The framework will help guide loan proceeds to finance eligible renewable energy projects including solar and wind power generation projects, reinforcing its commitment to promoting clean energy.

Subsequently, OCBC has extended an inaugural US$100 million green loan under Hero Asia’s Green Loan Framework – another example of OCBC directing capital to drive transition towards a low-carbon future.

# Hong Kong’s first green loan for logistics centre development

Real estate and transportation are two of Hong Kong’s highest emitting sectors. At OCBC, we aim to finance projects that tackle both sectors to drive the greatest impact towards a net-zero future.

In 2023, we were the mandated lead arranger, bookrunner and underwriter, and green loan coordinator for Hong Kong’s first green loan for logistics centre development. This expands on OCBC’s work in 2022, with our impactful sustainability-linked loan structuring on Hong Kong’s first sustainable finance in the logistics industry.

This HK$8.8 billion syndicated loan to ESR Group Limited and Chinachem Group will support the development of a modern cold storage logistics centre. The centre will be the city’s largest centre to be built in 20 years, with the aspiration of achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and Building Environmental Assessment Method (BEAM) Plus Platinum certifications.

Plans for the centre include an approximate area of more than 3,000 square metres for solar photovoltaic panels, and over 300 charging points for electric vehicles to support future tenants’ efforts in fleet electrification.

# Empowering Client Action

For a successful transition to net zero, businesses need to set ambitious, rigorous targets and follow through with strong initiatives to reduce emissions and measure progress. Through our engagements with our clients, we aim to influence them to take meaningful action to transition their businesses, while providing them with access to the knowledge and tools they need to do so.

That is why we introduced the OCBC 1.5°C loan, a new financing solution that aims to incentivise corporates to set and work towards clear carbon emissions reduction targets aligned with internationally-recognised, science-based net-zero decarbonisation pathways for their sectors. In 2023, we offered City Developments Limited (CDL) Singapore’s first net-zero-aligned loan. More details on the CDL 1.5°C loan can be found in the Climate Action chapter on page 25. This is aligned with our broader ambition to continue expanding our sustainable financing solutions across our key markets.

# OCBC’s first sustainability-linked loan in cement sector aligned with SBTi-validated decarbonisation trajectory

The cement industry is known as a carbon-intensive, hard-to-abate sector. Its main challenge lies in striving to reduce emissions while still meeting ongoing global demand. Developing economies’ infrastructural needs require the global development and deployment of new emission reduction technologies for the sector.

Demonstrating OCBC’s and Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC)’s commitment to supporting the low-carbon transition of cement, TCC has completed a NT$5 billion bilateral sustainability-linked loan with OCBC, where the targets are based on TCC’s science-based emission reduction targets for its cement plants in Mainland China and Taiwan (validated by the SBTi).

# Hong Kong’s first sustainability-linked dual-currency fixed rate loan in hospitality

Recognising hotels as some of the most emission-intensive buildings in Hong Kong, OCBC provided a market-first sustainable finance solution to support the climate transition of Shangri-La, a major international luxury hospitality group.

The HK$1.3 billion/RMB 1.15 billion sustainability-linked dual-currency fixed rate loan facility demonstrates OCBC’s and Shangri-La’s shared commitment to drive the transition to a low-carbon world, with predetermined targets that address material ESG issues in the hospitality industry.

Building on a strong banking relationship with the client, our teams worked across the region as One Group – identifying Shangri-La’s financing needs across its markets and tailoring a market-first dual-currency solution to support the client’s climate aspirations, liquidity and funding requirements.

# OCBC’s first sustainability-linked derivative with a Malaysian financial institution

OCBC has extended a two-year $150 million sustainability-linked loan and cross-currency swap to RHB Bank. The cross-currency swap will be used to hedge the currency risk coming on the back of the underlying $150 million sustainability-linked loan to RHB Bank. This will allow RHB Bank to convert its Singapore dollar-denominated proceeds to US dollar at a competitive rate and, at the same time, hedge US dollar or Singapore dollar currency exposure for the duration of the swap.

An early adopter, Topsteel Solutions Asia, provided valuable insights to fellow businesses on the adoption of solar energy solutions and how this benefitted their business by securing reliable energy at a lower cost. To catalyse action, industry experts from Energetix and Redex unpacked the opportunities, challenges and business models for solar adoption by SMEs.

# Singapore’s first green financing solution comprising green loan and carbon credits

As part of our commitment to support our clients in their transition journey, OCBC partnered with Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT) on Singapore’s first green financing solution that comprises a green loan and carbon credit.

Under the green financing solution, proceeds from the $419 million green loan will be used for the refinancing of a maturing facility, asset enhancement initiatives, decarbonisation projects such as procurement of energy-efficient technology for Tampines 1 and other general corporate purposes. The carbon credits, sourced through OCBC’s Emissions Trading Desk, will go towards investing in Verra or Gold Standard certified carbon reduction nature-based projects. The amount of carbon reduced will be equivalent to the financed emissions associated with the green loan. FCT will further purchase additional carbon credits to account for the residual and unavoidable Scopes 1 and 2 as well as energy-related Scope 3 emissions of the mall’s carbon footprint.

# Webinar: Building an energy efficient business

This webinar provided insights by businesses, such as Goldenlink Auto, on how being energy efficient makes significant business sense by reducing operating costs. Environmental design specialist G-Energy Global elaborated on principles of successful energy efficiency solutions applicable for SMEs. To further lower the barriers for action, the National Environment Agency (NEA) shared how SMEs can access green grants such as the Energy Efficiency Fund to offset capital costs for energy efficiency improvements.

# Webinar: Carbon 101

Carbon is a key topic for SMEs, especially those operating within global supply chains. Global textile and apparel company Ghim Li Group provided context on how the company measures, reports and manages its carbon emissions. Paia Consulting, a leading sustainability consultant, gave an introduction to carbon accounting, common challenges and, most importantly, how SMEs can overcome them. To simplify carbon accounting and reporting, Evercomm Singapore brought a technical lens to the process and how readily-available technological solutions can be deployed.

# A Differentiated Approach for SME’s Transition

SMEs play a pivotal role in the net-zero transition by supporting business value chains and networks to provide products and services essential for the net-zero economy. We introduced the Sustainable Finance Framework for SMEs in 2020 as we are aware of the challenges faced by SMEs when navigating this transition. This Framework was designed to simplify and reduce costs for SMEs seeking sustainable financing. Through this framework, we enable our SME clients to gain access to the capital they need to finance sustainable projects, expediting their shift to a low-carbon economy. The Framework has been verified by Moody’s ESG Solutions as aligned with all four core components of the Green Loan Principles. Moreover in 2023, the Framework was expanded to Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong, providing SMEs in our key markets access to straightforward sustainable financing.

Since our launch of the SME Sustainable Finance Framework, OCBC has extended sustainable financing solutions to over 1,200 SMEs regionally.

Beyond offering green loans, the Framework has enabled our bankers to have meaningful discussions on sustainability with our clients, helping to raise awareness on this topic among SMEs and identify leaders and solution providers to create an ecosystem of sustainability solutions with our clients.

With the growing global commitment to act on decarbonisation, many SMEs now aspire to embark on their sustainability journey to future-proof their businesses. However, the task of calculating emissions and reporting can be daunting. This is why OCBC continues to develop our ecosystem of enabling partners to support our clients in their sustainability journey, such as:

- EcoVadis, which provides sustainability assessments for our clients;
- Bureau Veritas and Tembusu, which provide emission monitoring and verification services;
- UN Global Compact Network Singapore (GCNS), which provides a simplified tool to record and manage emissions data; and
- STACS ESGpedia, Evercomm Singapore and Univers, which empower SMEs to effectively manage their ESG data to make data-driven decisions to decarbonise their businesses.

# OCBC partnered STACS to simplify carbon accounting for SMEs

The AI-powered ESGpedia platform by STACS has empowered numerous SMEs to kickstart their sustainability journeys. This simplified self-assessment tool enables business to streamline their sustainability reporting process, marking their first step towards net zero. One such SME is Ghim Li Group.

Ghim Li Group is a global textile and apparel company with vertical fabric mill and garment factories in Southeast Asia, serving buyers in USA, Canada and Europe. Leveraging on Ghim Li’s existing operational data, the platform calculates emissions following the ESCAP(4) Sustainable Business Network (ESBN) carbon accounting standards and facilitates external verification by Bureau Veritas. The platform allows Ghim Li to share its data and reports across both the Bank and customers. Using the verified emissions data from the platform, OCBC successfully offered a sustainability-linked loan of $16 million, supporting Ghim Li’s ongoing commitment to monitor and reduce its emissions.

Through collaboration with technology partners, OCBC is committed to simplifying sustainable finance for SMEs across diverse industries.

# Sustainable Investment Solutions for Clients

As we continue our pursuit of sustainable investment solutions for our clients, below are some notable highlights of key developments in 2023:

- Sustainable Investing Products and Research
In 2023, we continued to strengthen our shelf of thematic mutual funds and grew DPM’s World ESG Equity mandate. Concurrently, we have maintained our commitment to ESG research with a total of 21 reports including our newly launched interactive publications covering aspects of climate change and biodiversity.
- Singapore Stewardship Principles
In 2022, we were the first private bank to be a signatory of the Singapore Stewardship Principles. This milestone demonstrates our commitment to sustainability, as we progressively incorporate these principles into our processes, ensuring that sustainability remains at the core of our decision-making. As we forge ahead, we released our inaugural stewardship disclosure in 2023, further showcasing our dedication to transparently communicating our efforts in stewardship.
- The ABS Sustainable Investment
In 2022, we co-chaired the ABS taskforce that led to the release of the region’s first Sustainable Investment Guidelines for Private Banks and Wealth Managers. Following the launch of the guidelines, we have started implementing and incorporating the requirements into our processes in 2023 to align with the guidelines.

# ESG Training and Capacity Building

One strength of Bank of Singapore remains in our collaborative approach to sustainability where we continue to build a strong sustainability ecosystem across academia, non-profits, consultancies and regulators. Additionally, we remain active with industry associations to help shape the future of our industry to grow more sustainably.

In 2023, we continued to educate our clients in sustainability matters and encourage them to embed sustainability in their businesses through various client events including our industry outlook events but also through the second edition of our flagship Bank of Singapore Sustainability Summit. We organised five sustainability-related client events across Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. A key development has been the setting up of an ESG Dashboard capturing the client’s portfolio ESG performance combined with our new client ESG profiling framework.

Besides educating our clients, it is important to cultivate the expertise of our own employees in sustainability. We have continued to train our global workforce on sustainability and front office employees in aspects of sustainable investing through the ASFI Academy. As of December 2023, 1,125 employees have been trained in sustainability or ESG topics. Additionally, we held our first case competition on the topic of sustainable investing involving the higher education landscape in Singapore, which saw over 60 participating undergraduate teams.

# Collaboration with World Wildlife Fund (WWF)

The Bank worked with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to develop the Sustainable Private Banking and Wealth Management (SPRING) assessment tool. This tool is designed to help private banks improve portfolio resilience and ensure alignment with a low-carbon and sustainable future through the application of science-based approaches to responsible investing.

# Bank of Singapore Sustainability Summit 2023

Bank of Singapore’s flagship Sustainability Summit was attended by more than 200 clients and partners. With the theme for 2023 being Towards Net Zero, our panel of esteemed speakers from Google, Climate Alpha, GMO LLC and EverComm Singapore covered a range of sustainability topics from renewables and upcycling to use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and impact investing. The Bank’s clients were also treated to an interactive booth showcase featuring our sustainability ecosystem partners including GMO LLC, Siloso Beach Resort, MSCI and National University of Singapore.

Bank of Singapore has an ongoing strategic partnership with Ernst & Young through which we have been publishing a series of sustainability thought leadership pieces from the perspective of business owners, investors, and philanthropists. In 2023, Bank of Singapore released its latest sustainability publication: Carbon Credits: Catalysing Green Finance.

The focus on the topic of carbon credits is timely given the rise in interest in Asia and that it can enable local firms to achieve their net-zero targets.

# Why this is Material to Us

Our employees are the driving force behind our success, contributing to economic growth, maintaining our reputation and ensuring our longevity. To cultivate a more future-ready workforce, we are dedicated to fostering a sustainable learning organisation. By investing in our employees’ growth, we empower them to reach their full potential so that they can in turn contribute to the growth of OCBC.

Apart from creating a nurturing environment where our people can grow their career, we also prioritise health, safety and overall wellbeing of our people. We understand the significance of providing comprehensive support for their physical and mental wellbeing as it contributes to both job satisfaction and workforce productivity. We aim not only to enhance the individual’s wellbeing, but also that of the team and organisation as a whole.

# Our Management Approach

We are committed to foster opportunities for our employees. We firmly believe in the inherent talent and distinct skill sets that each employee brings to the organisation. By leveraging on their unique skills and experiences, they can chart their own growth journeys within the Bank.

Our focus is on creating a sustainable pool of future-ready talents by offering carefully curated learning opportunities for upskilling and comprehensive development. We prioritise skills-first career growth and continuous learning experiences for our employees, all of which are aligned with our core philosophy.

We recognise the importance of cultivating a thriving talent management ecosystem that aligns with our values. By doing so, we build knowledge and expertise in the banking industry. As we develop our employees’ skills and careers, we remain steadfast in our commitment to our employees’ wellbeing. We ensure that our growth as an organisation is matched by our dedication to the ethical and respectful treatment of our workforce.

# Employee Engagement Survey 2023

This survey was first conducted in 2004 to facilitate our understanding of the needs and concerns of our employees and to pinpoint areas that require enhancement, with the goal of increasing overall engagement and productivity. By responding to employee concerns and needs, we continue to nurture our engagement with our workforce and strengthen our proposition and reputation as an employer. This enables us to draw top talent and maintain a strong and valuable team that will contribute to our overall success.

As of 2023, the Employee Engagement Survey has been refreshed to include cultural and conduct outcomes. We believe in having a strong culture of individual and collective accountability, promoting mutual respect and encouraging employees to speak up. These essential cultural characteristics will promote a positive and supportive work environment, and drive our organisation’s success. We recorded an employee engagement score of 79% this reporting year, an improvement from 71% in 2021.(2) The percentage score represents the proportion of employees who would speak positively of their work experience, demonstrate motivation to contribute consistently and intend to remain with the organisation in the future.

Curating Learning Opportunities for Holistic Growth for our Employees

In 2023, we made a deliberate strategic pivot from Future Smart, our skill-focused development, to Grow Your Way Expedition, our skills-first growth and mobility initiative. Grow Your Way aims to create employee excitement around Career Mobility and showcase the diverse career growth options within OCBC.

Alongside our existing 19,000 programmes for employees, our inaugural Grow Your Way event saw the birth of another two signature programmes – Build Your Skills Portfolio workshops for employees and the Coaching for Growth certification programme for leaders. Complementing this, we are currently developing MOBI, an AI-powered platform that allows employees to assess their skills and delve into potential career possibilities.

While building technical and soft skills remains important, we have begun to emphasise Learning Agility, a critical meta-competency to drive long-term development within our workforce. This internal initiative equips our employees with abilities to effectively handle and navigate unfamiliar circumstances. Our Learning Agility Power (LeAP) framework promotes two central mindsets – the Growth mindset and the Productive Failure mindset. It also emphasises four key attributes: Reflectiveness, Reciprocity, Resourcefulness and Resilience. This holistic approach equips our employees with the necessary skills to adapt and excel in any circumstance, fostering a workforce that is resilient and versatile.

Leadership development continues to be a key tenet of our strategy to support employees' growth through our hallmark leadership programmes for leaders at all levels, ranging from the C-suite to the individual contributors. We have expanded our programmes to focus on developing traits such as managing different groups of people effectively and respecting their individuality in an empathetic and bias-free way.

On the coaching and mentoring front, we extended MentorMe – a mentoring programme traditionally catering to female employees – to male mentees in 2023. The pilot programme saw 149 mentor-mentee pairs; 59% of the mentees are males.

Launched in 2023 as a result of our strategic shift towards skills-first growth and mobility, the Grow Your Way Expedition was well-received by employees across various OCBC locations – Singapore, Malaysia, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Indonesia. We saw 12,000 completions of activities by employees and a 75% increase in awareness of career possibilities within the Bank. This two-week event was fully supported by senior leaders across the OCBC Group and featured several key elements.

The first key element was the Career Showcases, where over 70 coveted roles and their accompanying skills were showcased. These showcases offered employees diverse perspectives and insights into potential future career trajectories. The second element, Career Storytellers, allowed employees to share their personal growth narratives and career mobility experiences to inspire and motivate employees to take ownership and chart their own career path with OCBC. We also invited internal and external speakers from diverse backgrounds to share their life experiences, demonstrating how their skillsets, keen learning attitudes and resilience have unlocked unanticipated opportunities and guided their professional journeys.

Build Your Skills Portfolio workshop

In 2023, skills workshops and coaching certification programmes were introduced. The new Build Your Skills Portfolio workshop for employees facilitated their career reflection and skill discovery, and steered them towards building their unique skills portfolio.

We launched a Coaching for Growth certification programme designed to equip senior leaders with the skills to be effective career coaches, so that they can provide support to employees in their career exploration. This coaching programme saw senior leaders volunteering and pledging their commitment to be trained as career coaches.

These new initiatives pave the way for OCBC’s vision of skill-driven mobility and are supported by the upcoming launch of MOBI, planned for Bank-wide launch in 2024. MOBI, an adaptation of the Future Skills Accelerator platform developed by the Institute of Banking and Finance (Singapore), allows employees to visualise career possibilities within the Bank, and provides recommendations tailored to their career aspirations.

# Leadership immersion across borders

In the 2023 edition of the OCBC-INSEAD Executive Development Programme (EDP), 38 colleagues across various functions representing different geographies from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia participated in the leadership immersion programme.

# Sustainability-related Learning Opportunities and Training

As OCBC continues to make strides in our sustainability efforts, it is crucial that we prioritise building internal capacity and upskilling our workforce in sustainability-related matters to support and advance our sustainability agenda. During our immersive leadership development programme in Shenzhen, the Green Financing Banking Association (GFBA) shared insights with our OCBC leaders on the sustainability challenges faced by the banking sector in Shenzhen.

Additionally, we launched nine new certification programmes on sustainability in 2023 across OCBC Group, covering areas such as Sustainable Marketing, Media and Sustainability Stewardship. Complementing our certification programmes, a suite of 900 sustainability-related programmes were introduced in our curriculum, which saw more than 49,000 completions across the Group in 2023.

The leadership immersion programme consisted of three modules delivered throughout the year. In the first module, participants cast aside their job titles and roles within the Bank, going “back to school” to delve into strategic thinking, innovation, digital strategy and sustainability concepts. Professors from INSEAD kept the participants well-engaged with lively discourse often extending into the coffee breaks. The key highlight of the EDP was the one-week overseas immersion trip to Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Through visits to government-linked entities, start-ups, associations and well-established multinational corporations, participants gained invaluable first-hand insights into their achievements and challenges.

As part of their immersive leadership experience, participants were grouped and tasked with forming an Action Learning Project (ALP), aimed at proposing innovative ideas that could enhance OCBC’s strategic goals. Participants had to pitch their ideas and gain buy-in from the Management Committee and Group Chairman.

The final day of the programme was devoted to reflections on the course’s cumulative experiences. Participants acknowledged the value of the networks and relationships built over the duration. These connections established are anticipated to be beneficial for future work collaboration as the participants transition back into their respective professional roles.

Creating an Ecosystem for a Thriving Learning Culture

In 2023, we celebrated our community of growth champions, honouring over 900 Campus Stars and 57 returning mentors, marking our largest cohort yet. Notably, our employees produced more than 3,000 new learning resources, encompassing online courses, events, videos and reading materials, enriching knowledge-sharing within the Bank. Additionally, we fostered an organic network of growth champions through alumni gatherings for our signature leadership programmes. Nearly 300 past graduates reunited at these gatherings, cultivating a supportive community for professional growth across various business domains.

We launched Insights from the Inside which is a classroom-based learning series led by our employees from different business units. These sessions offered invaluable insights from across various functions, enabling employees to comprehend diverse roles within our Bank. Employees were able to foster meaningful conversations and connections through these engagements.

OCBC has actively forged strategic partnerships with external organisations that share our ethos and philosophy. We emphasised integrating our learning design principles into the ecosystem through nine benchmarking visits, engaging nearly 200 partners across industries including institutes of higher learning and public service organisations, enriching interactions and knowledge-sharing among participants.

As a testament to our strong organisation-wide strategy and commitment to workforce transformation, talent pipeline building and skills development, we received the Workforce Singapore’s Most Valuable Advocate Award in October 2023.

# Training and Developing our Workforce

We believe in empowering our employees with the necessary skills for success through the wide range of relevant training programmes offered. In 2023, we achieved an average of 54.6 hours of training and development across all employees. Our commitment to continuous development includes ensuring employees’ access to a wide variety of relevant training programmes across multiple modalities. In 2023, employees completed an average of 35.4 training programmes; more than 80% of our learning completions are in virtual and hybrid formats. This reflects our shift towards bite-sized learning-on-the-go, to enable all employees to excel and adapt in the dynamic world of banking.

Ensuring the Wellbeing of our Employees

In our commitment to ensure the wellbeing of our employees, OCBC developed a dynamic Group-wide MyWellness Framework. This framework serves as a robust support system that empowers our valued employees to proactively invest in their health and wellness. With the challenges posed by a rapidly evolving banking landscape, rising cost of living and other influencing factors, the framework is designed to safeguard the financial, physical, mental and family wellbeing of our employees. With a recent refresh in 2023, OCBC rolled out a series of targeted and proactive initiatives to support employees in each area of their wellbeing journey. By providing a supportive, safe and healthy environment, we contribute to the overall health and wellbeing of our employees.

# MyWellness Fiesta 2023

OCBC organised the MyWellness Fiesta in 2023 to promote the importance of holistic wellness and inspire employees to embrace sustainable lifestyles across key areas: family, mental health, physical fitness, financial management and workplace wellness.

The fiesta spanned three weeks, from October to November, providing ample opportunities for employees to participate in various activities and earn MyWellness points, enhancing their chances of winning exciting prizes.

One of the notable highlights from the fiesta was a panel discussion on Seeking Help and Giving Support. Employees from OCBC Singapore, OCBC Malaysia and OCBC China openly shared their personal challenges and experiences, fostering a deeper understanding of mental health and encouraging professional help for employees’ overall wellbeing.

Remarkably, the virtual event witnessed a participation count of 6,141 by 31 October 2023, marking a fivefold increase in participants compared to the previous year.

Additionally, a physical event took place in October 2023, featuring chiropractic practitioners who offered complimentary screenings for employees’ spinal health.

# Participation in Virtual Talks

Participation in virtual talks that aimed to provide valuable insights on mental, physical, and financial wellness to our employees. Talks were organised on emerging themes, including achieving a balance between hybrid work and family life, financial detoxing, managing debt and building resilience.

To support employees’ mental wellness, dedicated virtual booths were made available, offering wellness-related resources and access to wellness coaches or counsellors.

# Work Health Safety Sessions

Work health safety sessions were conducted, featuring engaging activities like scavenger hunts to identify equipment that minimises workplace injuries, mini-games to spot workplace hazards, a bulletin board for employees to share tips on handling workplace hazards, downloadable resources addressing common workplace injuries, and talks addressing high-level workplace risks.

# MyWellness Talks

As part of the wellness training roadmap, OCBC successfully conducted 35 wellness talks in collaboration with healthcare service providers. These talks aimed to provide valuable insights on mental, physical and financial wellness to our employees. In 2023, a total of 15,804 participations were recorded, comprising 5,046 employees who joined the live talks and on-demand sessions.

The importance of addressing work-related injuries cannot be overstated.

# International Women’s Day

In March 2023, we held our annual celebration of International Women's Day at OCBC, with over 750 employees in attendance. The occasion was dedicated to celebrating and honouring women, and attendees actively participated by sharing their thoughts on a collaborative data wall, expressing themselves through threaded labels and voicing their priorities. The importance of flexible work arrangements that accommodate personal schedules and responsibilities, as well as fair treatment, equal opportunities and advancement for all individuals, emerged as top concerns for the participants. The event had a strong focus on celebrating diversity and embracing the unique talents that women bring to the workplace.

Two panel discussions, namely MentorMe and W Suite, captivated the audience. The discussion featuring MentorMe, one of OCBC's flagship mentoring initiatives, featured a panel composed of our own women mentors and mentees who shared their heartfelt career journeys and emphasised the importance of nurturing mentors during early career transitions. The second panel discussion showcased women leaders from our esteemed W Suite programme. These inspiring panellists passionately advocated for greater female representation and highlighted the promising progress of women in STEM fields and C-suites.

# Unconscious Bias Training

We have strengthened our catalogue of more than 180 unconscious bias learning opportunities through more targeted programmes tailored for all employees, both managers and individual contributors.

# Gender Pay Equity

OCBC is committed to regularly reviewing our compensation practices to ensure gender pay equity within our organisation.

# Non-conventional Talent Hire Initiative

As part of our commitment to fostering a diverse environment for all, we launched our inaugural non-conventional talent hire initiative in 2023. The primary objective of the initiative is to provide opportunities for individuals who may have been overlooked given traditional hiring practices. Comprising three pilot programmes, the initiative offers flexible work arrangements and personalised tools and resources to ensure sufficient support is provided throughout their journey at OCBC.

1. # Return to Work Programme

This programme focuses on reintegrating mothers, caregivers and retirees back into the workforce. It offers empowering solutions such as flexible work arrangements and job-sharing schemes, tailored to accommodate their unique needs.
2. # Persons with Disabilities Programme

As a registered Open Door Programme (ODP) Employer under SG Enable since March 2023, we are committed to integrating persons with disabilities into the workforce. Key elements of this programme include:

- Engagement with persons with disabilities through volunteering, mentorship and internships. Notably, the Bank participated in SG Enable’s Virtual Career Preparatory Workshop in October 2023.
- Employment opportunities for persons with disabilities, accompanied by a job coach to assist in their workplace integration.
- Implementation of Resources/Support programmes to help persons with disabilities assimilate into the organisation and to train managers and their team about Disability Awareness to better support persons with disabilities in the workplace.
3. # Transiting Servicemen Programme

We conducted a career talk in August 2023 for approximately 35 servicemen, which focused on highlighting career transition opportunities for retiring servicemen; subsequently, we had our first successful hire of a serviceman into our organisation.

# Virtual Disability Awareness Talk

In October 2023, OCBC hosted our first Virtual Disability Awareness Talk in partnership with SG Enable. This initiative was part of OCBC’s ongoing efforts to enhance understanding and support for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in the workplace. Attended by 86 employees from the human resource function, the event featured a captivating keynote sharing by Jerome Syed, OCBC’s first successful PWD hire through SG Enable, who shared his journey of adapting to hearing impairment.

The event highlighted our dedication to workplace diversity, showcasing not only the supportive measures in place, such as clear communication guidelines to create a better work environment for employees with disabilities, but also OCBC’s broader efforts in integrating PWDs into our workforce. This approach demonstrates OCBC’s holistic vision of diversity, emphasising a workplace culture that values every employee.

“My colleagues at OCBC fostered a supportive environment, such as clear communication guidelines, which significantly improved my work experience. Throughout my journey, I’ve come to understand that disability awareness is about recognising unique strengths and abilities regardless of the challenges, and that collaboration is the key to diversity.”

On OCBC Sustainability Day 2023, we hosted the i’mable Collective by SG Enable Pop-Up Store. The store served as a platform to educate and engage our colleagues on the significance of sustainable merchandise created by persons with disabilities. Featuring products from three vendors – ART:DIS, Arts@Metta and Singapore Fashion Runway – the store offered a variety of items for purchase and support. This event not only highlighted the talents of these artisans with disabilities but also reinforced OCBC’s commitment to sustainability and diversity in a tangible and impactful manner.

# Why this is Material to Us

At OCBC, we acknowledge that our business growth is deeply connected to societal wellbeing. Being a regional financial services provider with a wide business footprint in Asia, we recognise that the way we conduct business has a lasting impact on the development of society and the environment. As such, our mission to give back goes beyond offering high-quality financial services.

# Our Management Approach

In addition to our dedication to financial inclusivity, we also inspire our workforce to actively contribute to society and the various markets we operate in. At the heart of our approach is encouraging volunteerism among employees, the promotion of financial resilience for individuals and businesses, and a steadfast commitment to transparency in economic contributions as well as responsible tax management(1), as we strive towards building trust and ensuring a sustainable future for all.

We are also committed to supporting underserved communities in strategic areas across our core markets. We seek to help these communities overcome challenges and meet their needs through curated programmes and tailored activities facilitated by our employee volunteers. Our community engagement programmes through our #OCBCCares Programme are anchored around key thematic areas, aligned with the Group’s Sustainability Framework:

- Families: Supporting cohesive and healthy family units.
- The Elderly: Meeting the health and social interaction needs of the ageing population.
- Persons with Special Needs: Encouraging social inclusion and acceptance.
- Children and Youths: Providing guidance and support for children and youths from lower-resourced backgrounds.

# Performance

Our continual dedication to financial inclusion is upheld by a comprehensive approach that addresses the retail and commercial needs of our customers throughout various growth phases. Our retail offerings tailored for each phase of life include Child Development Accounts (CDA) for young families, FRANK Student Loans for youth, OCBC Life Goals for career-focused adults, and the OCBC Digital Silvers Programme for seniors. This is complemented with bespoke and innovative products for SMEs that cater to their dynamic business needs.

# Programmes and Initiatives

# Child Development Accounts

The CDA is a special co-savings account which comprises (a) CDA First Step Grant which will be automatically deposited into the CDA without having to save first; and (b) dollar-for-dollar Government co-matching for each dollar that is deposited in the CDA, up to the maximum Government co-matching cap. These CDA funds can be used at the Baby Bonus Approved Institutions to pay for education-related and health-related expenses of your child. Despite having taken the pole position for market share of CDA in Singapore for multiple years, OCBC will continue to work together with the relevant authorities and products teams to further enhance our CDA proposition to benefit our younger customer base.

# Skills-Based Employee Volunteering Projects

In 2023, our employee volunteers from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China engaged in a multitude of initiatives encompassing 484 projects. We increased our skills-based employee volunteering projects by more than four times and a total of 208,155 beneficiaries benefitted from these programmes organised and guided by 16,329 OCBC employee volunteers. These ranged from financial literacy sessions for children with special needs to anti-scam workshops, creating edible gardens, cleaning coastlines and organising handicraft workshops for our charity partners. Details on such initiatives can be found in the subsequent paragraphs:

# Families100 Programme by OCBC

The Families100 Programme by OCBC, a partnership with the Ministry of Social and Family Development, is a first-of-its-kind social uplift initiative by OCBC targeting 100 lower-income families with children living in rental flats. We have assigned 200 OCBC volunteers to work closely with these families for 12 months, fostering self-reliance and social mobility. Besides financial aid, the programme offers avenues in sports, creativity and academic support for children and youths. Our employee volunteers also mentor parents in financial literacy and career guidance, establishing meaningful connections and empowering families to overcome challenges.

# Care Corner ElderConnect

The Care Corner ElderConnect initiative, supported by OCBC, targets over 3,500 socially isolated seniors above 60 years old by engaging them in OCBC and Care Corner Singapore activities at neighbourhood Active Ageing Centres (AACs). The aim is to combat social isolation and foster deeper community connections which are crucial for mental and physical health. In 2023, more than 1,000 employee volunteers have conducted monthly house visits to check on the wellbeing of these seniors and encourage them to step out of their homes for activities organised by the AACs.

# Greener Energy and Better Financial Literacy

Our employee volunteers from the OCBC Kajang branch in Malaysia came together and bought RM 24,000 worth of solar panels for Kaizen Children Home in Kuala Lumpur. This will enable the Home to save up to 100% in electricity bills, which will ultimately contribute to a greener and more sustainable world. The employee volunteers also donated necessities for the Home and taught the children financial literacy. This gave the children the necessary foundation to manage their money more wisely when they grow up.

# Little Green Summer Camp

The Little Green Summer Camp is an annual event in Mainland China that allows our employee volunteers to mentor the young camp participants. Through the interactions, the children can deepen their critical thinking abilities and improve their communication skills. Coming from less-privileged households in Shanghai, these children were encouraged to take initiative and strive to be the next generation of leaders to protect the environment. Through interesting courses, games, art workshops and a visit to the ocean park, these children were taught innovative and new ways to help mitigate climate change.

The donated necessities and solar panels will go a long way in managing operating costs for Kaizen Children Home.

# WWF Thirty Hills Initiative

Bank of Singapore is proud to be a sponsor of WWF-Singapore’s conservation project in Sumatra, Indonesia, known as the Thirty Hills Initiative. The sponsorship will go towards restoring over 38,000 hectares of rainforest in the Bukit Tigapuluh Ecosystem Restoration Concession.

# OCBC Nationwide Plastic Initiative

In a significant step towards environmental sustainability, we launched our Nationwide Plastic Initiative in September 2023. Together with local environmental start-up, Plastify, we established collection points at selected community centres across Singapore and at OCBC FRANK stores for the public to deposit their high-density polyethylene (HDPE) type 2 plastic waste over a period of three months. We collected a total of 302.5kg of plastic, out of which 142.5kg were HDPE type 2 plastic. This HDPE type 2 waste was then repurposed into vibrant and practical household items such as flowerpots and coasters, and sold at our OCBC Wisma Atria branch with the proceeds going to The Hut. Plastify also conducted a series of educational workshops aimed at educating and empowering the community to embrace more sustainable practices in their daily lives. Through these workshops, we equipped Singapore residents with the right knowledge and tools to make informed decisions about plastic consumption and recycling.

With our sponsorship and the collective actions of other WWF partners, WWF’s Thirty Hills Initiative has successfully replanted more than 67 hectares of land between January and June 2023, prioritising areas previously affected by wildfires.

The initiative also helps protect the wider Bukit Tigapuluh National Park from further encroachment and conversion by industrial plantations, which would otherwise lead to deforestation and carbon emissions.

The Concession stores an estimated 11.5 MtCO2e (metric ton of carbon dioxide-equivalent) of forest carbon stock, which plays an important role in mitigating climate change.

Collaboration efforts with The Hut Limited (Singapore) Having signed an official three-year memorandum with The Hut in December 2021, we pledged a total of $350,000 ($50,000 for infrastructure and $300,000 for education) to aid the children supported by The Hut. Functioning as a drop-in centre for children and youth, with the majority from lower-resourced backgrounds, The Hut serves as a sanctuary, equipping children and youth with essential skills to navigate life’s challenges, whether in school or at home. The Hut also houses a flagship programme called EduGrow for Brighter Tomorrows that provides tuition classes and mentoring to children. At the same time, the drop-in space provides the children and youth with a safe and nurturing environment where they can study while their parents are at work.

Our unwavering commitment to serve the Bumiputera SMEs in Malaysia In 2023, the Bank continued its commitment to financial inclusion by extending digital banking solutions to Bumiputera SMEs in Malaysia, recognising their pivotal role in the country’s economy. To enhance their access to online financial services, we introduced fully digital product offerings, including the eBiz Account-i, a Shariah-compliant business account launched in June 2023. Our digital onboarding option revolutionised accessibility by eliminating the need for SMEs to visit physical branches, offering a low initial deposit, a business debit card-i and an optional QR payments collection service, OCBC One Collect. By December 2023, over 1,000 SMEs had adopted OCBC eBiz Account-i, showcasing their confidence in our solutions.

Acknowledging the significance of capital access for SME growth, we launched online Islamic financing for Bumiputera SMEs in August 2023, streamlining the application process and witnessing a growing number of monthly online submissions. Being committed to nurturing the growth of Bumiputera SMEs, we conducted community outreach programmes in partnership with Halal Development Corporation (HDC), including events like Jelajah Halal Malaysia. This event helped to promote financial literacy within Malaysia's Halal ecosystem. These initiatives empower SMEs with knowledge and tools for informed financial decisions, fostering broader financial inclusivity within the Bumiputera community.

With funding from OCBC, The Hut revamped its facilities to better cater to these children, and financed tuition for 72 children over three years. With the current memorandum nearing its completion, we decided to extend our support for an additional three years, providing another $300,000 in funding to support the children’s educational needs. Beyond financial contributions, our employees actively volunteer weekly at The Hut, teaching younger children literacy skills as well as inculcating proper money management habits to help them manage their finances better. Witnessing the growth in these children, from struggling with basic literacy to making significant improvements in school assessments, has been immensely rewarding for our volunteers. Over the three-year period, our 45 volunteers have collectively contributed 1,944 hours of volunteer service. Additionally, we have organised various activities, from financial literacy workshops to museum visits, aiming to provide the children with engaging experiences and insightful learning opportunities.

The ongoing digital evolution in financial services presents opportunities for Bumiputera SMEs in Malaysia to efficiently handle finances and access capital, nurturing inclusivity and economic growth within this sector.

Financial solutions for women entrepreneurs in Indonesia

Since its inception in 2020, OCBC Indonesia’s flagship #TAYTB Women Warriors Programme continues to empower female entrepreneurs, aligning with the Bank’s commitment to fostering gender equality and positively impacting Indonesia’s socio-economic landscape. With over 60% of the country’s Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) led by women, the programme aims to support and empower these entrepreneurs.

In 2023, the programme has assisted more than 1,300 women entrepreneurs, providing loans totalling IDR 3.2 trillion at preferential rates. The access to financing is complemented by Nyala Bisnis, a programme offering transaction banking solutions with enhanced benefits, along with comprehensive tools for e-commerce, taxation, accounting, online payments, and social media management. Moreover, OCBC collaborates with women-led MSME communities like UMKM Perempuan Perintis Indonesia (UPRINTIS), Indonesian Business Women Association (IWAPI), and the Indonesian Women’s Leadership Organisation (PERPINA), fostering financial literacy, business acumen and a supportive network among women entrepreneurs.

Bank of Singapore has partnered with non-profit organisation Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS) to offer site visits to beneficiaries to support our clients’ philanthropic goals.

# Community Foundation of Singapore

In 2023, Bank of Singapore continued our expansion and integration of philanthropic offering within our wealth advisory processes. To support our clients’ philanthropic goals, we offered the option of site visits to beneficiaries through our collaboration with Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS).

Through this collaboration, clients can partner with CFS, who will provide the expertise needed to make an impact on Singapore’s charitable landscape. Clients will be able to donate to over 400 charities in Singapore by setting up Donor Advised Funds as a tool for philanthropic giving.

In October 2023, CFS organised the inaugural Donor Learning Trip to the Singapore Association for Mental Health to share funding gaps and opportunities with interested clients.

# Going Forward

Community development is not just a social responsibility but a strategic imperative for sustainable growth and positive societal impact. We will continue our drive to consistently innovate our range of products and services while adjusting our business model to meet the diverse requirements of society. By investing in local communities, supporting small businesses and providing access to financial services, we strive to make a meaningful difference in the lives of individuals and communities we serve.

# Our Forthcoming Targets

- Increase by 10% in annual employee volunteering hours in 2024
- Encourage deeper engagement with the community through at least five projects that foster ties between beneficiaries and employee volunteers
- Maintain No. 1 market share in Child Development Accounts in Singapore in 2024

Prioritising the trust of our stakeholders and holding ourselves to the highest ethical standards have made OCBC synonymous with integrity, reliability and financial soundness. Since 1932, OCBC has built an invaluable franchise through decades of strong, long-term relationships with our customers. We continue to uphold their trust and confidence by enshrining honesty and ethics in all that we do.

Our Brand Promise to be reliable, smart and knowledgeable and take a long-term view reflects our commitment to building enduring customer relationships by delivering reliable services and excellent experiences; offering the most suitable financial solutions; and giving the most relevant financial advice and support.

# Our Management Approach

Fair dealing is a core part of our corporate culture. Our core values of LIFRR guide our actions and decisions. We are committed to:

- recommending products that are aligned with our customers’ financial objectives and risk profiles;

# Fair Dealing

# Programmes and Initiatives

The Fair Dealing Committee, Framework and Monitoring Programme to ensure that fair dealing is an integral part of our interactions with customers, we use quantitative and qualitative indicators in our Monitoring Programme to measure and monitor our performance against the fair dealing outcomes set out by the MAS. The Fair Dealing Committee, which consists of division heads from various business units, leverages the findings from the programme to determine the Group’s performance in fair dealing.

The quantitative indicators in the Monitoring Programme include the number of misconduct cases reported to the MAS, audit results, compensation amounts arising from mis-selling and the MAS Balanced Scorecard results, covering financial, operational and business areas. The qualitative indicators reflect how systemic the cases of misconduct are. This grading system is a comprehensive and objective approach in identifying gaps quickly and ensuring they are addressed appropriately.

We review the Programme for continual enhancement of our practices, processes and policies. In 2023, no adverse issues were identified in our reviews.

# Product Suitability Committee, Policy and Guidelines

The Product Suitability Committee, Policy and Guidelines govern the approval of new investment products, ensuring that customers are only recommended products which are appropriate for them. Using OCBC’s Product Suitability Risk Rating Methodology, the Product Suitability Committee is responsible for evaluating the soundness of investment products. This methodology takes into account the target customers’ risk profiles as well as the risk considerations of new investment products. Products are then recommended after aligning customers’ risk profiles with the product risks.

# Safeguards to ensure pricing fairness for customers

Beyond policies and processes, OCBC leverages technological innovation to safeguard customers’ interests in their investment dealings with us. To ensure that customers will not be overcharged during their transactions with us and to promote pricing transparency and fairness, the team behind the Group Wealth Platform (GWP) designed the platform’s order management system with pricing fairness considerations in mind. Besides automating the transfer of price improvements, GWP also imposes limits on the spread Relationship Managers (RMs) can charge during trade execution so that trades beyond the maximum spread approved by the Singapore Product Suitability Committee (SPSC) will not go through.

To further safeguard customers’ interests in the sale of riskier investment products, we limit the sale of Loss Absorbing Capital Instruments (LACIs) to only those issued by Singapore local banks. Before the sale of a bond, the RM and Treasury Advisor must perform due diligence checks to confirm whether the product is a LACI – LACIs issued by any non-local banks are strictly not sold to retail customers in Singapore. Customers also have to fulfil certain criteria, such as being proficient in English, passing a Customer Knowledge Assessment and having prior investment experience in bonds, before they are allowed to buy LACIs in Singapore.

Before proposing new products to the committee, our product managers in Singapore are tested to validate their understanding of OCBC’s Product Suitability Policy and Guidelines. The Policy and Guidelines is essential in reinforcing the transparency and comprehensiveness of our risk disclosures to safeguard fair pricing and mitigate risks for our customers.

# Going Forward

Upholding the trust of our customers and building enduring relationships with them remains a core priority for OCBC. Guided by our core values of LIFRR, we remain committed to ensuring that fair dealing continues to be embedded in our corporate culture and practices.

# Our Forthcoming Targets

- Maintain 100% completion of mandatory employee training on fair dealing in 2024(4)
- Maintain zero significant cases of mis-selling from a regulatory breach perspective in 2024(4)

# Financial Crime Prevention

Safeguarding the financial system

# Why this is Material to Us

Financial crimes can potentially disrupt banking services and result in financial losses for our customers, organisation and the broader economy. Financial crime threats, if mismanaged, can also pose significant legal and reputational repercussions, which will severely compromise the integrity of the financial system and erode the confidence of our stakeholders. It is therefore critical that we continue to remain vigilant and resilient against these threats and safeguard the interest of our stakeholders.

# Our Management Approach

We recognise our responsibilities in safeguarding the integrity of the financial system and take an active stance by implementing comprehensive financial crime prevention measures across the Group. Our holistic approach encompasses risk governance, people, processes and leverages on technology to effectively prevent and manage financial crimes. We prioritise staying up to date with the latest systems, enabling us to swiftly adapt to the constantly evolving scam typologies. As such, we continuously upgrade our Fraud Management System to ensure quick responses to incidents and to effectively counter any attacks in real time.

Recognising the importance of vigilance within our organisation, we continuously enhance our framework, policies, processes and controls to combat evolving financial crimes. We provide mandatory training to increase employees’ awareness and knowledge throughout the Group. We also actively collaborate with law enforcement agencies, other financial institutions and the wider community to jointly combat financial crimes.

# Performance

# Programmes and Initiatives

# Anti-Fraud Measures

In our commitment to protecting our customers, we prioritise customer education, vigilance and taking pre-emptive measures as our primary defense against scams. In 2023, we intensified our efforts to educate customers about scam typologies and methods to safeguard themselves. Utilising various channels such as social media, direct electronic mail and SMS, we raised awareness among our customers about scams.

# Our Policies

As part of our approach to manage and prevent financial crimes, we are guided by key policies covering anti-money laundering and fraud. These policies detail our commitment to safeguarding the Bank and our stakeholders, and provide clear guidance on the required response in the event of any incidents. These policies are reviewed regularly and updated as needed by the Anti-Fraud Standing Committee and Group AML/CFT & Reputational Risk Committee (Group ARRC).

- Group AML/CFT Policy
- Guidelines on Fraud Measures
- Fraud Incident Response Procedure
- Group Code of Conduct
- Group Anti-Fraud Policy
- Whistleblowing Programme
- Anti-Criminal Facilitation of Tax Evasion Policy

We actively monitor and assess any shifts in scam trends to ensure that our customers are protected from new scam typologies. We strengthened our fraud detection capabilities and maintained close collaboration with key industry players and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) to explore additional anti-scam security measures and safeguards for our customers. In recognition of our efforts in helping customers who fell victim to scams, we were presented with 10 awards by the SPF in 2023.

To combat malware scams, we have implemented additional measures on our OCBC Digital app. When the app detects the usage of remote administration tools, it automatically blocks access. We also block logins when we detect the presence of apps that have not been downloaded from official app stores and have the accessibility function turned on. These measures specifically address malware scams where apps are downloaded through Android Application Package files and prevents unauthorised parties from remotely accessing our customers’ devices.

# Financial Crime Prevention

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures

Since 2019, OCBC Singapore has been actively collaborating with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) through Project POET (Production Orders: Electronic Transmission) to allow banking information to be conveyed more promptly between the Bank and the SPF. Since it was devised, it has resulted in a 99% reduction in turnaround time, now completing requests within just one to two days, enhancing efficiency in solving financial crime cases. The effectiveness of POET has attracted more LEAs to join us, benefitting from the expedited response times that OCBC provides. With LEAs and banks working together more swiftly and efficiently, we are better equipped to detect and investigate suspicious trends and patterns, ultimately combating financial crimes and minimising money laundering risks.

We are also committed to safeguarding the integrity of the financial system on a wider scale by actively contributing to industry-wide initiatives such as the AML/CFT Industry Partnership (ACIP) and Project COSMIC, which stands for Collaborative Sharing of Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing Information and Cases. Additionally, our participation in The ABS Standing Committee for Fraud further demonstrates our dedication to fortifying compliance controls and increasing the industry’s resilience against financial crime.

Apart from our collaborative efforts, OCBC consistently emphasises the importance of risk awareness among our employees. This is evident through the mandatory AML and CFT training that all our employees must complete (an annual refresher is required). Through this focus, we have been able to effectively detect early signs of money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions risks. By swiftly identifying these risks, we are empowered to take prompt and proactive actions to mitigate potential threats. Moreover, our commitment to integrity is embedded in our Code of Conduct, emphasising that all our business activities are conducted in an honest and ethical manner. The Bank adopts a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, corruption and fraud. This unwavering commitment further strengthens our ability to maintain a secure and resilient banking environment.

# Going Forward

In the coming years, financial crime prevention will see remarkable advances and transformative changes driven by the continuous evolution of technology and the relentless ingenuity of criminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. To stay ahead of these emerging threats, the future of financial crime prevention will have to incorporate a dynamic and proactive approach. OCBC and SPF jointly working to safeguard Bank customers and minimise losses to scams at the Anti-Scam Centre.

# Strengthening partnership to combat scams and safeguard our customers

OCBC, in partnership with the Anti-Scam Centre of the SPF, proactively identifies scam victims and promptly alerts them to prevent further financial losses. Many victims only become aware that they have fallen victim to scams after receiving police alerts urging them to halt all monetary transfers immediately. This joint operation reflects the ongoing commitment of the SPF and OCBC to safeguard Bank customers and minimise losses to scams. Over the course of a four month-long joint operation from April 2023 to August 2023, we successfully disrupted more than 830 ongoing scams, preventing further potential financial losses exceeding $22.4 million.

We continue to enhance our anti-scam measures to protect our customers from evolving scams. For example, our OCBC Digital app incorporates an anti-malware security feature that blocks access upon detecting malicious apps on devices. Since its launch in August 2023, this anti-malware security feature has prevented scammers from stealing over $2 million in savings from more than 30 OCBC bank accounts.

OCBC maintains a robust system of internal controls that serve to safeguard shareholders’ investments and the assets of the Group. These controls are instrumental in mitigating the occurrence of unexpected losses and minimising the risk of fraudulent activities.

# Programmes and Initiatives

Aligned with our Sustainability Imperative, Conducting our Business Responsibly, we have implemented various programmes aimed at fostering a positive risk culture while meeting the expectations of regulators to actively identify measurable indicators to assess risk cultures and evaluate the adequacy of existing policies in promoting a desired risk culture.

# 1. Material Risk Takers (MRT) Programme

The Material Risk Taker (MRT) programme identifies employees whose authorities and actions have a significant impact on the Bank’s long-term performance as well as a material impact to the Bank’s risk profile. To encourage prudent risk behaviour within this group, the programme includes measures such as deferring the payment of their variable performance bonuses. In addition, employees with significant variable performance bonuses will also have a portion of their bonuses allotted as deferred shares.

# 2. Employees Conduct Triggers (ECT) Programme

Under the ECT Programme, each employee is assessed against a set of ECT Indicators, whereby employees who breach ECT indicators will be accorded ECT points. The ECT points will be accumulated for review and consequence management (where necessary) during the year-end appraisal. Through this programme, it ensures employees’ conduct is aligned with the expected standards.

In 2023, the Bank has introduced initiatives to further enhance the current ECT programme. This enhancement not only focuses on consequence management for employees who have breached ECT indicators, but also reinforces and recognises employees who exhibit exemplary risk behaviour. Initiatives include offsetting of an ECT point, if any, in the following year if an employee does not incur any ECT breaches in the current year.

# 3. Governance and Oversight of Global Markets Rogue Trading/Unauthorised Trading

To ensure proper governance and oversight of the Global Market Rogue Trading/Unauthorised Trading (RT/UT) and Market Conduct Risk, OCBC has established clear understanding among all Global Markets (GM) employees. They are required to conduct themselves in a proper manner to discharge their responsibilities effectively in the best interest of the Bank and our customers.

The Bank’s Global Markets Trade Surveillance and Governance programme provides early warning of control issues that could create opportunities for rogue trading or unauthorised trading activities, drives risk management actions to rectify any control gaps, and allows management to have a single view of all RT/UT controls.

The governance of RT/UT underwent enhancements in both 2022 and 2023. The enhancements included extending controls coverage from front office to all support areas, including Market Conduct Risk, aligning with key risk scenarios defined by Financial Markets Standards Board (FMSB), Global Markets Policies, MAS regulations and the Bank’s ECT programme.

To streamline the management of Global Markets Conduct Risk, all crucial end-to-end key controls were consolidated under a single governance and supervision body. This extended governance framework was initially implemented in Singapore and all international branches, with plans in place for implementation in the subsidiaries by 2024.

# Going Forward

Good governance and culture are crucial enablers in realising our sustainability aspirations. Conducting our business responsibly allows us to serve as effective stewards for our customers and society, to ensure lasting and enduring value creation.

# Our Forthcoming Targets

- Maintain high percentage of employees exhibiting the desired risk behaviours in 2024.
- Maintain 100% completion of mandatory employee training on fraud awareness, whistleblowing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption in 2024.

(2) Global Markets is responsible for the management of the Group’s asset and liability interest rate positions, engagement in foreign exchange activities, money market operations, fixed income and derivatives trading, and offering of structured treasury products and financial solutions to meet customers’ investment and hedging needs.

(3) Target includes performance of OCBC Singapore international branches.

(4) Target includes performance of OCBC Singapore international branches and Great Eastern Holdings. For training on anti-bribery and anti-corruption, the target excludes performance of OCBC Property Services Pte Ltd.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|UN SDG 5|5.1|End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.|• Celebrating women in banking and tech on International Women’s Day: OCBC celebrated International Women’s Day by highlighting the importance of gender diversity and embracing the unique talents that women bring to the workplace. This was accomplished through range of activities and panel discussions featuring our own women mentors and mentees who shared their personal career journeys and underscored the importance of nurturing mentors during early career transitions.|Workplace Diversity – pages 61-66|
| |5.5|Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life.|• Launched Return to Work Programme: OCBC launched the Return to Work Programme as part of the non-conventional talent hire initiative to reintegrate mothers back into the workforce by offering empowering solutions such as flexible work arrangements and job-sharing schemes to accommodate their unique needs. • Commitment to Gender Pay Equity: We are committed to regularly reviewing our compensation practices to ensure gender pay equity within our organisation. Our forthcoming targets that support the UN SDG: • Maintain a balanced gender mix across our workforce in 2024 • Achieve 42% of leadership positions to be filled by women by 2025|Workplace Diversity – pages 61-66|
|UN SDG 7|7.2|By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.|• Maximising renewable energy adoption: OCBC is making significant progress in integrating sustainability measures across our local and regional buildings and branches. In 2023, we installed solar panels covering 27,000 square feet in key locations. • Improving building energy efficiency: OCBC is consistently prioritising the deployment of sustainable technologies, optimising building system efficiency and exploring innovative solutions for Group-owned properties. In 2023, we implemented several solutions to improve our building’s energy efficiency through HVAC optimisation and the installation of ceramic nets to reduce the cooling load of our AHUs. • Providing solar financing solutions for clients: OCBC supported multiple clients to increase their adoption of renewable energy. In 2023, we financed the launch of a pioneering 192MW floating project in Taiwan as well as the extension of the inaugural US$100 million green loan to support a China’s largest wind farm operator under the Green Loan Framework. OCBC also developed a SME Solar Programme which provides financing directly to solar providers secured against their PPA. Our forthcoming targets that support the UN SDG: • Maintain carbon neutrality for OCBC’s banking operational emission in 2024 • Receive BCA Green Mark award for all OCBC Bank Singapore branches by 2030 • Provide electric vehicle charging facilities to other major Group-owned commercial building by 2025|Climate Action – pages 18-30, 35-38 Sustainable Financial Solutions – pages 43-51|

These ERGs foster a sense of community and support as they provide a platform for employees with shared backgrounds, experiences or interests to come together, share knowledge, offer support and advocate for their specific needs within the workplace.|
| |8.8|Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments of all workers, including migrant workers, particularly women migrants and those in precarious employment.|• Ensuring the wellbeing of our employees: OCBC developed the Group-wide MyWellness Framework to empower employees to proactively invest in their health and wellness.

This initiative aims to provide opportunities such as flexible work arrangements and personalised tools and resources for individuals who may have been overlooked in traditional hiring practices. • Providing financial solutions for women entrepreneurs in Indonesia: OCBC’s #TAYTB Women Warriors Programme continues to support and empower women entrepreneurs in Indonesia. As of 2023, we assisted more than 1,300 women entrepreneurs, providing loans totalling IDR 3.2 trillion at preferential rates. • Providing unconscious bias learning opportunities: OCBC strengthened the catalogue of more than 180 unconscious bias learning opportunities through targeted programmes tailored for all employees, both managers and individual contributors. • Creating a strong culture of governance: OCBC aligned the Group’s Code of Conduct with the regulations, codes and corporate governance guidelines in the jurisdictions we operate in.|

INDEPENDENT PRACTITIONER’S LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT ON SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION OF OVERSEA-CHINESE BANKING CORPORATION LIMITED

We have been engaged by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (the “Bank” or “OCBC”) to undertake a limited assurance engagement in respect of the selected sustainability information from the 2023 Sustainability Report of the Bank described below for the year ended 31 December 2023 (“the Identified Sustainability Information”).

# Practitioner’s Independence and Quality Control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

# Identified Sustainability Information

The respective Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended 31 December 2023 is set out below:

1. GRI 2-7: Employees
2. GRI 302-1: Energy consumption within the organisation
3. GRI 302-3: Energy intensity
4. GRI 305-1: Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions
5. GRI 305-2: Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions
6. GRI 305-3: Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions
7. GRI 305-4: GHG emissions intensity
8. GRI 401-1: New employee hires and employee turnover
9. GRI 404-1: Average hours of training per year per employee

Our assurance engagement was with respect to the year ended 31 December 2023. We have not performed any procedures with respect to (i) earlier periods and (ii) any other elements included in the Bank’s 2023 Sustainability Report, and in the annual report, website and other publications, and therefore do not express any conclusion thereon.

# Reporting Criteria

Our firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Management 1 which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

# Practitioner’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We performed our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions included in the Identified Sustainability Information, Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 – Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (“SSAE 3410”) (collectively the “Standards”). These Standards require that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement. The extent of our procedures depends on our professional judgment and our assessment of the engagement risk.

The Identified Sustainability Information has been assessed against the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting Standards 2021 (“the Reporting Criteria”).

# Management’s Responsibility for the Identified Sustainability Information

Management of the Bank is responsible for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. The responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of Identified Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Bank’s use of the Reporting Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.

# Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance Report

The procedures selected included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. Given the circumstances of the engagement, we also performed the following:

- interviewed management and personnel in Group Corporate Services, Property Services, and Human Resources departments in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information;
- obtained an understanding of how the Identified Sustainability Information is gathered, collated and aggregated internally;
- performed limited substantive testing, on a selective basis, of the Identified Sustainability Information (i) to verify the assumptions, estimations and computations made in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information; and (ii) to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported, to the extent we considered necessary and appropriate to provide sufficient evidence for our conclusion; and
- assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Bank’s Identified Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

# Conclusion

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended 31 December 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.

# Purpose and Restriction on Distribution and Use

This report, including our conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Bank in accordance with the letter of engagement between us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Bank for our work or this report.

# Inherent Limitations

In designing these procedures, we considered the system of internal controls in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information and reliance has been placed on internal controls where appropriate. Because of the inherent limitations in any accounting and internal control system, errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur and not be detected.

Yours faithfully
