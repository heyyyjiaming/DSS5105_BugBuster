# Board’s Statement

Dear Stakeholders,

FY2019 was a dynamic and eventful year for Synagie Corporation Ltd. (“Synagie” or “Company”, and together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”). In FY2019, we embarked on numerous initiatives that continue to benefit the Group and our stakeholders today. Among others, we were appointed as a partner by Enterprise Singapore to work on a developmental project to help SMEs internationalise through E-Commerce. We have also successfully expanded our operations into Thailand and Vietnam.

Our goal is to achieve a sustainable business in the long term and focusing solely on financial performance is not sufficient. Sustainability considerations are important to our long-term business strategy, especially in this phase of growth that we are in. We are committed to working closely with our stakeholders to better understand their concerns and ensure that their interests are protected.

On that note, we are pleased to present our second Sustainability Report – a testament to our commitment in upholding good governance. With assistance from our Sustainability Committee, the board of directors (“Board”) had considered sustainability issues as part of its strategic formulation and determined the material Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors that are material to the continuity of our Group’s business. The Board is overall responsible for the oversight of the management and monitoring of the material ESG factors.

Ensuring sustainability in our business requires a collective effort and we wish to invite our stakeholders to join us in our sustainability journey. Together as one, we can continue to achieve greater heights and create more value for our stakeholders.

Our achievements to date would not have been possible without our team of dedicated staff and the continuous support of our business partners. We would like to express our appreciation to our staff and all our stakeholders for contributing to this Sustainability Report.

For and on behalf of the Board of Directors

Lee Shieh-Peen Clement

Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer

# Materiality Assessment

Through various channels of communication and feedback received, materiality analysis is performed to identify sustainability issues that are important to our business and stakeholders. The analysis allows us to assess and prioritise stakeholders’ needs, and assists us to allocate our resources more efficiently to achieve long-term sustainable business.

The materiality analysis has considered the GRI guidelines and the topics are prioritised based on a materiality matrix. The matrix considers the potential impact and significance of each topic to our business and its importance to stakeholders.

Our review focuses on 4 key aspects with 9 identified material topics. For each material topic, we report on its relevance to our business and stakeholders, and the measures put in place to address it. There are no newly added material topics as compared to the materiality assessment conducted in FY2018 as there is no change in our business and operations as well as the environment that we operate in.

# Material Topics

|Topic|Why is this material for us and stakeholders|How we are addressing the issue|
|---|---|---|
|Economic Aspect|A sustainable business is not one that solely focuses on profits. Building a business with sustainable growth prospects ensures continuous creation of economic value for stakeholders.|We seek to create long-term economic value for our stakeholders through building a sustainable business and brand through expansion of our geographical influence.

# Environmental Aspect

# Energy and water efficiency

As Singapore is working towards reducing its carbon footprint by encouraging lower energy consumption, we are committed towards energy conservation.

Our commitment to energy efficiency is evident through our constant effort to minimise energy consumption in daily office operation with the use of motion-triggered lightings, maintaining air-conditioner temperature at 25 degrees Celsius and the use of energy-efficient light bulbs such as LED lights.

We are taking reasonable measures to minimise energy consumption through improving overall energy efficiency of the Group. In return, this can create cost savings for the Group.

In addition, we actively monitor our energy usage in office to ascertain the effectiveness of our energy conservation measures.

# Social Aspect

# Talent attraction and retention

According to a study conducted by McKinsey, high performers are 400 percent more productive than average performers. High productivity of employees has a positive correlation with business performance. However, great talents are scarce and it has been a challenge to attract talents that fit into our Group’s culture and structure. Retaining talents is another challenge faced by our management.

Nevertheless, we are committed to attract and retain the right talent that fits into our dynamic corporate culture.

We are committed to recruit employees based on merit and valuable industry experience. Attractive remuneration, staff benefit and welfare, as well as the opportunity to develop are put in place to attract and retain talents.

Furthermore, employees are granted with flexible working hours as we recognise the benefits of flexible working hours, such as reduced costs, increased productivity and innovation, staff retention, and talent attraction. As the Group’s operations expand across the region, we are also considering to extend the same benefits to employees in our overseas offices.

# Occupational health and safety

Maintaining good records for occupational health and safety benefit the Group in terms of upholding corporate image, greater staff retention, regulatory compliance, lower level of absenteeism and better cognitive performance. Further, employees also benefit from improved quality of life and sense of well-being. We are committed to taking care of our employees’ health, safety and well-being and this forms the foundation of our warehouse and supply chain process design.

As our warehouse and logistics employees may be exposed to health and safety risks, we are committed to create a safe working environment for our employees. Occupational health and safety measures are integrated into our daily operations. Employees exposed to health and safety risks are constantly reminded to put on the necessary protective equipment. This is aligned with our mission to providing a safe working environment. Health supplements are also made available for employees to maintain good health and well-being.

Furthermore, we are exploring the possibilities of extending insurance coverage to employees in our overseas operations.

# Training and development

With an increasingly competitive business landscape, rising complexity and digital revolution, constant reskilling and upskilling of employees have become ever important. As the value of human capital declines when knowledge becomes obsolete, we are committed to invest in training and development to sustain the value of our human capital.

Opportunities for training and development have also increasingly formed the top criteria to attract and retain talent. The lack of training and development opportunities is also one of the key reasons for high employee turnover. This further strengthened our desire to provide our employees with training and development opportunity. Apart from benefiting the Group, training and development also equip our employees with the current knowledge and skillsets that would further benefit them in their career.

In 2019, we sent our management team to attend an overseas training conducted by Alibaba Group. Upon their return, they shared their knowledge, skills and experience gained during that visit.

# Governance Aspect

# Ethics and business conduct

Good corporate governance refers to having the appropriate people, processes and structures to direct and manage the business and affairs of the Group to maximise long-term shareholder value, while taking into account the interests of other stakeholders. Good corporate governance strengthens investors’ and shareholders’ confidence in the Group.

We are committed to establish our corporate image based on the foundation of good ethics and business conduct.

We have zero tolerance towards corruption and fraud as this is evident in our formalised Code of Business Ethics and Conduct policy, which is made available to all employees. This applies to all employees, including those who are located in foreign jurisdictions. Our key management in Singapore oversees the overseas operations, which mitigates agency risks as a result of the remoteness of such operations.

Accessible and independent whistleblowing channels, including direct contact with the Audit Committee Chairman, allow our employees to report any suspected wrongdoings without the fear of reprisal. Furthermore, our open-door policy culture also provides employees with channels to escalate any suspected wrongdoings to the management.

In addition, we have also established a privacy policy on our corporate website to provide transparency on our handling of confidential customer data.

# Governance Aspect

# Risk

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling threats to an organisation’s capital and earnings. Management of risks and threats is one of our top priority as our operations involve collection of large volume of customer’s personal data through our big data analytics. Data protection of confidential customer’s personal data is also a great concern to stakeholders.

Hence, we also engage in an iterative risk management process that involves feedback gathered from all stakeholders. This enables us to provide greater assurance to stakeholders in our pursuit of growth for the Group.

# Economic Objective

Our aim is to revolutionise commerce through our ecosystem and create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.

# Approach

# (a) Creating Economic Value

A sustainable business is not one that solely focuses on profits. Building a business with sustainable growth prospects ensures continuous creation of economic value for stakeholders. We seek to create long-term economic value for our stakeholders through:

# Initiative to provide E-Commerce solution and training for SMEs

In December 2019, we launched our initiative to help local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adopt cross border E-Commerce. As we are an appointed partner by Enterprise Singapore to work on a developmental project, to help SMEs internationalise through E-Commerce, qualifying SMEs who adopt our Multichannel Cross-border E-commerce Platform Solutions (MICES) to sell online in regional and international marketplaces via the cloud-based E-Commerce platform will receive 70% of subsidies for their subscription of the Solutions Package through Enterprise Singapore’s grant, commencing from 1 November 2019. This will help SMEs to kick start their cross-border E-Commerce business and make cross-border E-Commerce more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, SMEs have the opportunity to scale up their online businesses overseas and to increase their digital marketing activities on these overseas platforms with minimal capital outlay.

# A partnership with Nanyang Polytechnic’s Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (NYP-SIRS)

A partnership with Nanyang Polytechnic’s Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (NYP-SIRS) was also established to provide certified E-Commerce training for employees of SMEs who adopted the Group’s cross border solutions. Employees of qualifying SMEs will need to complete three training courses which include a one-day mandatory course “Connect Your Business to Online World with Synagie” which is exclusively developed by NYP-SIRS for Synagie to guide users to use Synagie’s self-served cloud platform to manage their online businesses. Users are also required to select and complete two additional modules from a list of approved training programmes which include the “Alibaba CEO Programme”, a 6D5N Study Trip to the Alibaba University in Hangzhou, the “Alibaba Managerial Elite Programme” and the “Alibaba New Retail Content Marketing Programme”. This comprehensive training programme will equip users with valuable knowledge and provide sufficient guidance to effectively benefit from the use of MICES to kick start their E-Commerce business.

# Increase number of Brand Partners and optimise product mix

Our continuous effort to strengthen our existing Brand Partners base has been rewarding as we have established partnerships with more than 280 Brand Partners as at the end of FY2019. Our Brand Partners include well-known brands such as Johnson & Johnson, Kimberly-Clark, Shiseido, Suunto, Salomon, Schwarzkopf and Chef Nic packed food products. We have also constantly sought to optimise our product catalogue mix to enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of our products offer. In June 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary secured the management of online sales for Samsonite International’s brands including Samsonite, Samsonite Red, American Tourister, Lipault and Kamiliant across E-Commerce platforms such as Lazada, Shopee and Zalora in Malaysia.

This marks our Group’s diversification into Travel & Lifestyle E-Commerce sector and we wish to continuously seek more opportunity to further diversify the Group’s potential revenue stream in the region and create sustainable growth prospect.

Apart from that, we were also appointed as KOSÉ exclusive solutions enabler to facilitate end-to-end online commerce process in Lazada including management and operations of KOSÉ flagship stores on Lazmall (official flagship store on Lazada). Our existing product range of beauty products is broadened as shoppers will now be able to shop for Sekkisei range of beauty products carried by KOSÉ. The result of this partnership was pleasing as we achieved record sales for the beauty brand launch on Lazmall in Singapore and Malaysia as well as surpassing sales target after 12 minutes of launch in Malaysia.

Through our continuous effort to increase the number of Brand Partners and optimising our product mix in FY2019, we have achieved great growth in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) in events such as Lazada birthday event, 9.9 and 11.11 Singles day shopping event.

# Expansion to new geographical market

We have established our market presence in Singapore, Malaysia and Philippines and further expanded our Southeast Asia regional presence into Thailand and Vietnam through the platform of Lazada and Shopee as of the end of FY2019. We are committed to continue expanding our connectivity with new Brand Partners in the region and strengthen our market presence.

# Expansion through strategic partnerships

We entered into several strategic partnerships with established corporations in FY2019. In May 2019, we collaborated with SingPost to provide on-demand warehousing and fulfilment solutions to SMEs in Singapore and Southeast Asia. That collaboration allows SMEs in Southeast Asia to utilise state-of-the-art warehousing and fulfilment services provided by SingPost’s subsidiary and powered by our cloud commerce platform. This would benefit the SMEs through greater operational efficiency and faster turnaround time as well as allow brands and SMEs to save on heavy upfront capital expenditure to setup or operate their own warehouse by acquiring integrated warehousing services on a pay-as-you-use basis without long-term commitments. The partnership would also enhance our fulfilment solution to customers and creates competitive advantage against our competitors.

In June 2019, a deal was sealed with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Weimob Inc. The deal would allow us to leverage on Weimob’s E-Commerce enablement solutions and deep domain expertise in the China1 E-Commerce market to offer an end-to-end solution via our cloud commerce platform. This would offer integrated cross border E-Commerce and advertising solutions to help SMEs in Southeast Asia to penetrate into China E-Commerce market. The partnership would also allow Synagie’s end-to-end solution to cover the entire commerce value chain from setting up SME's store account to digital store management, content translation,

# Digital Marketing and Smart Supply Chain

Digital marketing and smart supply chain for fulfilling cross-border orders to consumers in China. This would greatly increase the efficiency of our business partners and reduce the cost required to penetrate into the China market. Furthermore, the partnership creates an opportunity for us to expand into new geographical market and to extend our market presence.

# Strategic Partnership with Weimob Inc

Apart from establishing a strategic partnership with Weimob Inc, our wholly owned subsidiary was also appointed by Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), a government agency under Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, to be the cross-border E-Commerce Initiative Partner for its National E-Commerce Strategic Roadmap Seller Adoption Programme 2019 to 2020. The programme is a government initiative developed to accelerate the adoption of E-Commerce amongst Malaysian businesses with the goals of doubling Malaysia's e-Commerce growth rate and reaching a targeted GDP contribution by 2020. This partnership enables us to leverage on MDEC's nationwide network in Malaysia to offer our E-Commerce enablement solutions to businesses in Malaysia. This would speed up the E-Commerce adoption by local businesses and seamlessly sell their products in E-Commerce markets in Southeast Asia and China through our established network. Moreover, it ultimately benefits local businesses in areas such as reduced operation costs, improves image, streamline operational processes and more.

# Partnership with Lazada Services

In August 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary had also established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Lazada Services South East Asia Pte Ltd to provide services for or on behalf of Lazada in relation to management and operation of assigned selected brand store on Lazada’s online market places in Southeast Asia. As Lazada has a big presence in Southeast countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, the partnership is strategic for us to further strengthen our market presence in the region as well as opportunity to expand our presence to a country like Indonesia. Ultimately, long-term economic value and growth prospects are created, which will aid us in achieving our vision to create sustainable commerce.

# Innovative Insurtech Business Model

In March 2019, we launched an on-demand mobile application (app) called Kiasu.me, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The new on-demand lifestyle insurance app, which is usable on both IOS and Android devices, focuses on delivering instant pay-as-you-use lifestyle insurance policies tailored to protect consumers from threats and hazards in their digital lifestyle at an affordable premium. It is a breakthrough from traditional insurance policies as it provides custom-fit protection for users through partnership with our A-rated insurance partners. Furthermore, users have the freedom to add on protection or cancel anytime. This creates a differentiation between our insurance products as compared to other competitors.

Kiasu.me offered its first innovative product – Device Shield, which was launched in the form of a scratch card available at leading mobile phone retail outlets in Singapore. Device Shield is a 12-month accidental screen damage protection for brand new mobile phones that covers the cost of one screen repair for all major brands with coverage activation and automated claims powered by Kiasu.me. This innovative insurance coverage includes an app-based concierge service that picks up the damaged phone for repair and send it back to the consumer after repairing, free of charge.

# Product and Customer Service Quality

It has been our goal to build a reputation for quality and to exceed our customer’s expectations. We want to build a sustainable business relationship with our customers through our reputation for delivering quality products and services. We value customers’ feedback on their purchase experience. Our Customer Engagement Specialists have undergone customer service training to address customers’ queries and feedback. The type of concerns raised during the interaction are also collected and categorised into the relevant markets and brands before assessment begins. The results of our analysis are shared with the relevant departments for their follow-up action with our Brand Partners and logistics partners. We also monitor our response rate to customers’ feedback on the various platforms and have established key performance indicators for our customer service staff.

Data analytics is also employed to better understand customer behaviour and demands. With our cross-border expansion to countries such as Malaysia, Philippines as well as Thailand and Vietnam in 2019, we are enhancing our data analytics capabilities to cater to different customer database setup.

The use of real time big data analytics helps us to better understand customer behaviour and demands to offer the optimal products and services mix and E-Commerce shopping experience to our customers.

# Environmental Objective

We seek to be an environmentally aware and socially responsible corporation through integration of eco-friendly practices in our corporate strategies and decisions to minimise our ecological footprint.

# Approach

We provide dynamic conversion, analytics and fulfilment solutions to our Brand Partners through our cloud commerce platform and real-time big data analytics. The environmental impact of our operation comprises of electrical usage to power our offices and warehouses, disposal of leftover materials through packaging our deliveries at warehouses and general waste created during daily operations. Despite our direct ecological footprint being relatively small, we are committed to mitigate climate change and conserve resources.

# (a) Waste Management

Majority of the waste created by our operations are leftover packaging materials, which include cartons, plastic wraps, strings, wooden pallets and paper. In response to our national vision towards becoming a Zero Waste Nation and a Leading Green Economy, we are continuously exploring ways to integrate the value of 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) in our daily operations.

In FY2019, we have extended our corporate effort towards waste management through the placement of 2 recycling bins in our office, apart from the recycling bins placed in the warehouses. We are also exploring ways to extend our commitment to create a paper-less operating environment.

# At our warehouses, reusable packaging materials such as wooden pallets and carton boxes for goods packaging are continuously being reused at the warehouse, whenever possible. Similarly, recyclable materials such as paper boxes are sold to waste recycling vendors for recycling.

# However, our efforts in overall waste management would not be possible without the corporate-wide efforts to comply to our waste management policies and procedures to ensure waste is properly segregated.

# Reusing of product boxes for packing of customer orders

# (b) Energy and Water Efficiency

# Our commitment to improve energy and water efficiency is evident through our constant effort to minimise consumption in daily office operation. Our effort includes the use of motion-triggered lightings, maintaining air-conditioner temperature at 25 degrees Celsius and the use of energy-efficient Light-emitting diode (LED) light bulbs. To measure the effectiveness of our effort towards minimising energy consumption, we actively monitor our energy usage at our office. Energy-saving culture is also cultivated in the office as employees are encouraged to switch off lights and air-conditioners in office when not in use.

# Our Performance

# In FY2019, all environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions we operate in were adhered to and there were no fines or penalties incurred for non-compliance.

# Electricity usage monitoring has been our continuous practice since relocation to our new office in mid-2017. Through continuous monitoring and new conservation initiatives, we are committed and continuously exploring ways to improve our energy efficiency in the long term to ensure the environmental sustainability of the Group.

# We have extended our utilities tracking to all our Singapore and Malaysia offices. However, we are unable to track our electricity and water usage by our employees in Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam offices as they use co-working spaces in the respective countries.

# Electricity and Water Consumption

# Based on total number of 85 employees in Singapore and Malaysia as at 31 December 2019

# Comparison to FY2018 Environmental Performance

In comparison to our FY2018 environmental performance, our electricity usage for Singapore office increased from 18,827 kWh to 27,914 kWh, mainly due to the increase in our headcount and we had leased another new office space in March 2019. The increased office capacity is partly to house our employees from the Insurtech segment after their lease expired in April 2020. Notwithstanding, our water usage for Singapore office decreased from 331 Cu M to 276 Cu M.

# Environmental Performance in FY2019

|FY2019 Target|Performance Update|
|---|---|
|Set up recycling bins in offices and warehouses|Achieved through placement of recycling bins in office and warehouses.|
|Monitor and track amount of packaging material and paper used and seek ways to reduce amount of waste by 5% by 2021|Not achieved as we have yet to find an optimal, cost-effective and feasible way to monitor and track the amount of packaging material and paper reduced. Nevertheless, we are committed towards our national vision of becoming a Zero Waste Nation and a Leading Green Economy by exploring new ways to minimise waste generation.|
|Improve energy and water efficiency by 2%|Partly achieved. We have included data from our Insurtech subsidiary this year, accounting for the surge in electricity usage per employee. However, we managed to achieve our water efficiency target this year. Notwithstanding the above, we still endeavour to improve our electricity and water efficiency by 2% in FY2020.|

# Environmental Target for FY2020

|FY2020 Target|Action plan|
|---|---|
|Find an optimal, cost-effective and feasible way to monitor and track amount of packaging material and paper used and seek ways to reduce amount of waste by 5% by 2021|Potential collaboration with recycling company to find an optimal, cost-effective and feasible way to monitor and track amount of packaging material and paper used.|
|Improve electricity and water efficiency by 2%|Explore new ways to improve energy efficiency such as encouraging employees to turn off their computers instead of leaving them on screensaver mode, and unplug idle electronic devices etc.|

Corporate citizenship is a core component of our corporate responsibility strategy and we commit to conduct our business in a way that is ethical, friendly and beneficial to community as well as upholding ethically-oriented practices.

# Approach

Our business cannot thrive without the resources from the society. Understanding and embracing the importance of our social capital ensures the sustainability of our business in the long term. This includes putting in place ethical labour practices, appreciating and rewarding our employee’s contribution to the Group as well as prioritising their health and safety above all.

# (a) Talent Attraction and Retention

# Competitive and equitable remuneration

We are committed to recruit employees based on merit and valuable industry experience, and attract talents with competitive and equitable remuneration, staff benefit and welfare, as well as the opportunity to grow and develop. However, we understand that finding the right talent that fits into our Group’s culture and structure can be a challenge. Hence, we are also committed to retain existing talent as we highly value their contribution and we recognise other benefits of retaining existing employees.

This is achieved through providing all employees with equal opportunities for compensation, promotion and training on a meritocratic basis. Systematic review and evaluation of employee’s work performance is conducted annually, and results of the evaluation is taken into account in their annual salary review. This motivates our employees as their performance are rewarded based on our fair merit-based compensation system. The annual performance review and evaluation also provides a platform for open communication between employees and their direct superior to discuss and potentially create a developmental (training) plan to harness their skills.

Our employee benefits and human resource policies are also reviewed annually to ensure our competitiveness in the social aspect as well as aligned with manpower regulations in the jurisdictions we operate in.

# Employee benefits and welfare

Recognising the benefits of flexible working hours which include reduced operating costs, increased productivity and innovation, staff retention and talent attraction especially for working parents, etc, we have implemented a flexible working schedule. Our flexi-time work arrangement gives employees the flexibility to vary daily work start and end times to suit their work and personal commitments.

We also adopt all benefits and welfare practices which conforms to the manpower legislations of the various jurisdictions which we operate in.

# Other employee benefits and welfare provided include outpatient/dental expenses reimbursement, travel expenses claim and entertainment expenses reimbursement for management level.

# Christmas Event

# Bootcamp Fitness Class

# Human rights and freedom of association

We respect the principles of freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, non-discrimination and harassment, meritocratic and progressive human resource practices, and advocates the elimination of forced or child labour. All employees under the Group are entitled to practise freedom of association, within regulatory limits of each jurisdiction which we operate in.

# Diversity

# Our diversified workforce

We see great strength in the diversity of our workforce and the potential in each and every one of our employees. Diversity inspires creativity and drive innovation to enhance our strategic competitiveness and derive solutions to overcome business challenges. Our Employee Code of Conduct guides us towards this aspiration.

We recruit talents of various backgrounds and our dynamic human capital cover people of various age groups, races and genders as we highly value the experiences and knowledge that different individuals bring to the Group. We adopt a firm stance against human rights infringement and discrimination to ensure a conducive work environment for our employees. Overall, this is in line with one of our commitments to our human capital which is to give equal opportunity and ensure no discrimination of employees based on gender, race and religion.

# (b) Operational Health and Safety

Maintaining good records for occupational health and safety benefit the Group in terms of upholding corporate image, greater staff retention, regulatory compliance, lower level of absenteeism and better cognitive performance. Further, employees also benefit from improved quality of life and sense of well-being. Our commitment to ensuring our employees’ health, safety and well-being forms the foundation of our warehouse and supply chain process design.

We are committed to create an accident-free environment for our employees at the warehouse and logistics operations. For instance, employees exposed to health and safety risks are constantly reminded to put on the necessary protective equipment, such as safety vest and boots. This is aligned with our mission to providing a safe work environment. A safe work environment also provides greater assurance to our employees and customers. All employees operating Mechanised Handling Equipment (“MHE”) are also sent for courses to be certified before operating the MHE.

According to Elaine Lau, Chief Corporate Solutions Officer at AIA Hong Kong and Macau, an unhealthy workforce translates to lower engagement, higher staff turnover, lower productivity and inefficient benefit utilisation. Recognising the importance of having a group of healthy human capital, we provide our warehouses’ employees health supplements, such as fish oil, glucosamine and vitamins, on a daily basis.

All our employees in Singapore are covered under basic medical insurance and benefits programme, which insures them against any injury or illness that requires medical, surgical or hospital treatment, sustained in the course of employment. In addition, we provide travel insurance to employees who are required to travel regularly overseas for business.

# (c) Training and Development

With an increasingly competitive business landscape, rising complexity and digital revolution, constant reskilling and upskilling of our employees have become ever important. As the value of human capital declines when knowledge becomes obsolete, we are committed to invest and provide the necessary opportunities to sustain the value of our human capital. In October 2019, we sent 4 of our top management to attend the “Alibaba CEO Programme” held by Alibaba Global Business School in Hangzhou. The Alibaba CEO Programme is an immersive study trip that would equip our top management with better understanding of the latest developments in internet and e-commerce, analyse New Retail, Big Data, New Marketing, Cross-border and transcend Digital Thought Leadership with new retail strategy, operation and branding.

Apart from investing in our top management, we also sent 41 employees to attend the following training and development programmes held by reputable training organisations throughout FY2019.

With our effort to reskill and upskill our employees, we have clocked a total of 784 training and development hours in FY2019.

Understanding that opportunities for training and development have increasingly formed the top criteria to attract and retain talent, we will continue to source and invest in training and development to equip our employees with the skills and knowledge required to discharge their roles and responsibilities as well as contribute towards our goal to maintain a long-term sustainable business.

Through our current annual performance appraisal, we are able to identify gaps in knowledge and gather feedback from employees. It also allows us to communicate with our employees to better understand their needs and work out effective solutions to bridge the knowledge gaps through specialised training and development plans specially designed for them. Furthermore, it allows us to invest in the right training and development programmes.

# Governance

# Objective

We seek to establish our corporate image based on the foundation for good ethics and business conduct and our commitment to transparency and accountability to stakeholders.

# Approach

(a) Corporate Governance, Business Ethics and Anti-Corruption

Achieving good corporate governance requires the appropriate people, processes and structures to direct and manage the business and affairs of the Group to maximise long-term shareholder value, while taking into account of the interests of other stakeholders. Acknowledging that good corporate governance strengthens investors’ confidence and ensures long-term sustainable business performance, we conduct our business with good ethics and business conduct by adhering to the principles and guidelines of the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance 2018 and other applicable laws and regulations.

Our Board and board committees comprise of directors, who are qualified professionals equipped with core competencies such as accounting or finance, business or management experience, industry knowledge, legal and strategic planning experience. Our Board and board committees have an appropriate balance diversity of skills, experience, gender and knowledge of the industry. Diversity provides the Board with a wider range of perceptions and experience, which can improve the quality of its collective decision-making.

Sustainability matters are incorporated into the Group’s strategy formulations. Our Board meets at least four times a year to review and evaluate the key activities and business strategies of the Group.

Key information of our Directors are available on pages 10 to 12 of the Annual Report respectively.

We conduct our business through the application of ethical business practices that is critical in fostering trust and building confidence in our stakeholders and investors. The formulated Code of Conduct (Code) sets out the guidelines and practices which management and all employees are expected to understand, internalise and abide. The Code is found in the Staff Handbook, which is provided to all new employees during their orientation.

# Anti-corruption

We have established zero tolerance towards corruption and fraud and this is evident in our formalised Code of Business Ethics and Conduct policy, which is made available to all employees. This applies to all employees, including those who are located in foreign jurisdictions. Our key management in Singapore oversees the overseas operations, which mitigates agency risks as a result of the remoteness of such operations. We are dedicated in conducting ourselves with utmost integrity. Our firm stance is communicated to all employees.

# Whistleblowing

A whistleblowing policy has been in place to help employees who have major concerns over any wrong-doing within our Group relating to unlawful conduct, financial malpractice or dangers to our Group, the public or the environment. Our accessible and independent whistleblowing channels, including direct access to the Audit Committee Chairman, allow employees to report any suspected wrongdoings without fear of reprisal. We view any harassment or victimisation (including informal pressures) towards the whistle-blower seriously, and will take appropriate action to protect those who raise a concern in good faith. Furthermore, our open-door policy culture also provides employees with channels to escalate any suspected wrongdoings to the management.

Management of risks and threats is one of our top priority as our operations involve collection of large volume of customer’s personal data through our big data analytics. Furthermore, the constant flux of the business environment has fuelled a heighten need for organisations to identify, measure, prioritise and respond to the risks that threaten business objectives and operations. At our organisation, we are prudent in managing our risk-reward relationship. Annually, we carry out enterprise risk review to ensure that we account for new risks that arise as we seek new business opportunities.

We will continue to monitor to ensure that the risks are kept within our risk appetite and mitigated to our best ability.
