# Investing In Technology & Innovation

Captii Limited

Captii invests in technology and innovation. In 2020 we focused on managing our investments against the challenging backdrop of CoViD-19 lockdowns and restrictions, made no new investments. Our venture investment portfolio at year-end comprised 14 companies from 7 countries. While many investees weathered the impact of the pandemic by finding new sources of business and funding, or were fortunate enough to benefit from the circumstances, some did not fare as well. One investee of ours failed to secure new funding and ultimately faced liquidation in 2020.

Against the backdrop of the pandemic, both our venture investment portfolio and our existing businesses of Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS, had a mixed year in 2020. Investee of Captii Ventures whose businesses benefited from the circumstances and behavioural changes brought about by the pandemic did well and countervailed the decline in value of those that were adversely affected by CoViD-19. In a year of ups and downs, our venture investment portfolio was fair-valued at S$11.8 million at year-end, versus investment cost of S$8.2 million.

# Annual Report 2020

# Executive Chairman’s Letter

Dear Captii Shareholder:

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present the Annual Report of Captii Limited for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.

# A year of contrasts

Our Group entered the 2020 financial year on the back of thirteen profitable years.

Our Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS businesses, both recorded lower revenue in 2020. Of the two businesses, it was GlobeOSS that recorded the higher decline in revenue of 14.6% with 2020 revenue being S$9.3 million compared to S$10.9 million in 2019. Unifiedcomms revenue meanwhile declined by 6.7% to S$12.1 million in 2020 compared to S$12.9 million achieved in 2019.

As a result of this, Group revenue decreased from S$23.8 million in 2019 to S$21.4 million in 2020, a decline of S$2.5 million.

Gross profit recorded by our Group was lower this year, in line with the lower level of revenue. However the magnitude of the decrease was lesser than that of revenue – gross profit declined by 9.3%, as compared to the 10.3% decrease in revenue. This reflected the considerably higher average gross profit margin for the year of 52.8%, attributable to the favourable sales mix for 2020. This year the lower margin system sale contract revenues of GlobeOSS comprised a smaller proportion of Group revenue.

At the start of 2020, we continued to have adequate cash balances to continue with the strategy of augmenting organic growth with growth by strategic investment. The Captii Ventures team identified and screened several candidates for investment throughout 2020 but none progressed further to consummation. As a result, the number of investees in the portfolio remained as fourteen in total. The work to identify, screen and engage on further investment opportunities will persist in the new year.

# Balance sheet strength and dividends

Although we had no acquisitions or investments in 2020, during the year we continued to reinvest in GlobeOSS and Unifiedcomms – especially for the PostPay business – for further product development as well as for the acquisition of assets to support the fulfilment of managed service contracts. We continue to have a strong balance sheet at year-end 2020 with ample cash and cash equivalents of S$13.1 million. This was also after declaring and paying to shareholders a dividend for the eleventh year running. We had on 18 September 2020, paid a tax-exempt interim dividend of 1.25 Singapore Cents per share. In light of the anticipated capital requirements of our Group’s growth and investment-driven development strategy, no further and final dividend payment has been recommended by our Directors for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.

# In gratitude

Group profit before tax came in at S$2.9 million for the year, 18.8% lower compared to the S$3.6 million achieved in 2019. Although our Group bottom line benefited from the improvement in gross profit margin, the absence of fair value gain on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio this year compared to last year had resulted in a lower profit before tax for our Group in 2020.

Our overall bottom-line for the year was positive at S$2.1 million, though 26% lower than the S$2.9 million recorded last year.

2020 represented our thirteenth consecutive year of profitability. However as a result of the decline in bottom-line performance, our Group’s return on equity (ROE) decreased to 3.1% this year from 5.2% the year before.

# Lower system sale contract revenues and generally positive managed service contract performance this year, but mixed for business segments

Efforts to grow the managed service business persisted in 2020. Revenues from this contract type improved by S$1.3 million against last year with the increase being attributable to the higher managed service contract revenues at both Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS.

Group system sale contract revenues was lower for 2020. System sale revenue at Unifiedcomms declined this year to less than half the revenue achieved in 2019. GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues meanwhile declined by 28% to S$4.3 million in 2020 compared to S$6 million achieved in 2019.

# Annual Report 2020

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# An overview of our business

Our Group comprises three main segments: Unifiedcomms, GlobeOSS and Captii Ventures.

Throughout 2020, Unifiedcomms continued to address mobile network operators and integrated telecoms service providers with application and platform software, turnkey solutions and systems and a variety of professional and managed services. In 2016 a unit within Unifiedcomms called PostPay (formerly Mobilization) was revitalised into a fresh start-up and given prominence as part of a wider reorganisation of the Unifiedcomms business. PostPay focuses mainly on providing advanced solutions for prepaid credit on a managed service model. GlobeOSS meanwhile, has developed into Malaysia’s leading systems integration and solution provider in the telecoms big data and analytics field.

# Revenue by BU (S$’000)

|Year|Unifiedcomms|GlobeOSS|
|---|---|---|
|2019|12,937|10,876|
|2020|12,069|9,292|

Lower revenue at Unifiedcomms was caused by revenue from system sale contracts declining sharply to S$1.3 million in 2020 from S$3.4 million in 2019. Unifiedcomms managed service contract revenues improved from S$9.6 million to S$10.8 million but the growth achieved was not enough to offset the sharp decline in system sale revenues.

# Unifiedcomms Revenue by Type of Contract (S$’000)

|Year|System Sales|Managed Services|
|---|---|---|
|2019|3,374|9,563|
|2020|1,269|10,800|

Unifiedcomms operates primarily in the telecoms-tech markets of three regions: South East Asia (SEA), South Asia (SA) and the Middle East and Africa (MEA) while GlobeOSS focuses exclusively on SEA. For Unifiedcomms, with the exception of Malaysia, Singapore and Pakistan, where engagement with the customer is conducted directly by our own personnel, the majority of our engagements with customers are carried out through various sales channel partners. This two-tier sales and distribution approach enables us to cost-effectively reach customers within each region of focus and to tap into the local knowledge and insights of our partners to build and deliver compelling solutions.

Captii Ventures, the venture investment arm of our Group, focuses primarily on the SEA market for start-up investment opportunities. Our venture investment business regularly interacts with other venture capital (VC) management companies in the region and participates in funding rounds as either lead investor or as a co-investor following the lead investor.

As at end-2020, there are a total of 181 people that are employed in our Group. The majority of these personnel are located in Malaysia, where our operational headquarters is situated, while the rest work out of Singapore, Pakistan, Brunei, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.

Generally a positive year for Group profit though lower revenue. The Group recorded consolidated revenue of S$21.4 million for the financial year 2020, a decrease of 10.3% as compared to the S$23.8 million achieved in 2019. Both GlobeOSS and Unifiedcomms businesses recorded a decline in revenue against their 2019 results. GlobeOSS recorded revenue of S$9.3 million in 2020, a decrease of 14.6% from the S$10.9 million achieved in 2019. Unifiedcomms meanwhile had a 6.7% decline in revenue, turning in total revenue of S$12.1 million in 2020 versus S$12.9 million the year before.

|2019|11,909| | | |
|2020|11,182|578|450| |

The GlobeOSS business experienced a decline in system sale contract revenues in 2020. System sales contract revenues decreased to S$4.3 million in 2020 from S$6 million achieved in 2019. Managed service contract revenues however increased marginally by 1.8%, from S$4.9 million in 2019 to S$5 million in 2020.

|Year|System Sales|Managed Services|
|---|---|---|
|2019|5,971|4,905|
|2020|4,297|4,995|

GlobeOSS continues to have both its system sale and managed service business concentrated in the SEA region. The decrease in GlobeOSS revenue from the SEA region reflects the S$1.7 million decrease in system sale contract revenues between 2019 and 2020, that had more than offset the improvement in managed service contract revenues.

System sale contract average gross profit margin improved to 59.4% in 2020, primarily due to the lower contribution of GlobeOSS to system sale contract revenues of the Group as compared to 2019. Gross profit margin earned on managed service contract revenues was relatively flat, showing a marginal decline from 51% in 2019 to 50.4% this year. This decrease was mainly attributable to higher third-party costs on certain managed service contracts.

# Group-wide system sale revenue decline

The decline in Group revenue this year against last year was mainly attributable to the 40.4% or S$3.8 million decrease in both Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues.

We expected 2020 to be a challenging year for Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS on the system sale front. The region that proved most disappointing was SEA, which had its contribution fall from S$22.8 million to S$20.5 million. Similarly, the SA region’s result were below expectation, due to the underperformance of certain managed service contracts, coupled with impact of unfavourable foreign exchange movements. In contrast, the MEA region’s contribution to the total Group revenue increased in 2020 to S$0.6 million from S$0.5 million the year before.

# Revenue by Geographical Regions (S$’000)

|SEA|22,781|20,470|

|MEA|450| |
|Others|333|4|

In 2020, SEA, our Group’s home region, continues to be the largest geographic source of revenue, accounting for 95.8% of Group revenue.

# Lower total opex this year, before and after exceptional Items

Our Group’s operating expenditure for the year decreased to S$8.6 million this year as compared to S$9.4 million in last year. In 2019, we had a foreign exchange loss due to an unfavourable exchange rate movement of the Pakistan Rupee against the Singapore Dollar, and an impairment loss on plant and equipment relating to certain managed service contracts that have been assessed as being no longer able to generate previously expected income and returns.

This year, we had a fair value loss assessed on our Group’s venture investment portfolio, as certain investees’ business and capital raising activities were severely impacted by the CoViD-19 pandemic. Moreover, we continued to have a foreign exchange loss primarily due to the continually weakening of the Pakistan Rupee against the Singapore Dollar.

# Lower gross profit recorded, in line with lower revenue

In line with the lower Group revenue of S$21.4 million for 2020, a 10.3% decrease on 2019 revenue, absolute gross profit recorded for the year was lower as compared to 2019.

Group gross profit for 2020 was S$11.3 million, down by S$1.2 million or 9.3% against 2019. The magnitude of decline in gross profit was less than that of revenue as a result of the favourable sale mix achieved in 2020, which contributed by slightly higher overall gross profit margin earned on Group revenue of 52.8% as compared to 52.2% recorded the year before.

|Profit for the Year|2,300|3,384|2,867|2,121| |

Excluding the effect of exceptional items such as the impairment loss this year, our opex for 2020 was lower at S$8.3 million compared to S$9.1 million for 2019. This decrease was due to a reduction in Group headcount.

# Operating Expenditure before Exceptional Items (S$’000)

# Net Profile before Fair Value Effect (S$’000) & Net Profit Margin before Fair Value Effect (%)

| |2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|

|Net Profit Margin|17.1%|9.9%|10.2%|10.7%|7.0%|

When the bottom line numbers are examined more closely, to exclude exceptional gains of losses such as those to do with fair value movements of the Captii Ventures investment portfolio in 2016 to 2020, the profit performance of the Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS business is made more apparent. The ‘adjusted’ net profit generated by these two businesses have declined from S$4.0 million in 2016 to S$2.4 million and S$2.3 million in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

2020 marks our thirteenth consecutive year of being in the black. Group net profit for the year, at S$2.1 million, is 26% lower than the S$2.9 million achieved in 2019. This decrease in our Group’s bottom line reflects the absence in 2020 of any fair value gain on investment that we enjoyed on the revaluation of the Captii Ventures investment portfolio. In 2019 this fair value gain amounted to S$0.4 million.

In terms of bottom line, our Group recorded a net profit margin of 9.9% for 2020 versus 12% for 2019. If the effect of any fair value gain or loss is removed, our Group net profit margin for 2020 increased to 10.7% from 10.2% in 2019.

The flow-down effect of the changes in Group net profit before and after exceptional items and fair value movements is clearly reflected in our EBITDA results for the year.

# Annual Report 2020

# Management Discussion and Analysis

| | |EBITDA (S$’000)| |Shareholders Equity (S$’000)|Return on Equity (%)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|8,287|40,754| | |15.7%| |

| | |2018|2018| | |

| |2020|2020| | | |

EBITDA dropped to S$3.9 million in 2020, a decrease of 15.9% in tandem with the 26% decrease in net profit. A significant proportion of this EBITDA decrease is accounted for by the absence of any fair value gain on the Captii Ventures investment portfolio this year. Removing the effect of non-cash items in 2020, the cash generation performance at our underlying business can be identified. EBITDA before exceptional items and fair value gain stood at S$4.1 million for 2020 – a decrease of 6.8% against what was achieved in 2019.

This year the profit contribution of system sale contracts was considerably lower, caused by a decline in the revenue performance of both Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS. Managed service contracts however, showed steady revenue growth at Unifiedcomms. With the performance of our businesses being maintained if not improved further in 2021, we are optimistic of further extending our dividend payout track record – to at minimum, maintain the dividend per share that was paid to all shareholders last year.

EBITDA before Exceptional Items & Fair Value Effect (S$’000)5,7694,5984,4484,0714,14520162017201820192020

As at end-2020, we continued to have more than sufficient capital to augment our organic growth plans with growth by strategic investment. This remains an essential element of our current business plan that targets sustained, double-digit Group profit growth and a significant uplift of our ROE performance.

Throughout 2020, our venture investment business persisted in identifying and evaluating many investment opportunities in the SEA region, unfortunately none could be progress to consummation. As a result, we have maintained a total of fourteen investments in new technology ventures and start-ups as at end-2020.

Because of the lower net profit delivered in 2020, our Group’s return on equity (ROE) for the year dropped to 3.1% from the 5.2% achieved in 2019. Another year with single-digit outcome is certainly a disappointing result. Looking back at the double-digit outcome of 2016, it was aided by the outsized contribution from the significant fair value gain on the venture investment portfolio that year. Without the benefit of this gain from our venture investment portfolio our Group would have had a much lower ROE for 2016.

# Reviewing our 2020 balance sheet positions

Now to turn to our Group’s balance sheet as at the end of the 2020 financial year: we ended 2020 with slightly higher current assets of S$25.3 million, as compared to S$25.1 million as at end-2019. This is mainly attributable to the increase in Group cash and cash equivalents as a result of an improvement in collections. This improvement was partly offset by the S$0.6 million utilised on repayment of interest bearing borrowings. After the repayment of borrowings, Group cash and cash equivalents as at end-2020 was S$13.1 million as compared to S$10.2 million as at end-2019.

Cash and Cash Equivalents (S$’000)13,1479,05510,1738,6867,39120162017201820192020

Our total non-current assets decreased from S$28.9 million as at 31 December 2019 to S$28.7 million as at 31 December 2020, representing a marginal decrease of 0.7%.

# Annual Report 2020

# Management Discussion and Analysis

Total liabilities of our Group as at 31 December 2020 decreased from S$8.6 million to S$7.1 million. This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in borrowings, trade and other payables, following repayments in the reporting year.

# Reviewing movements in Group cash

Our Group’s net cash generated from operations for 2020 was S$5.6 million, an increase of 28.9% as compared to the net cash generated from operations of S$4.3 million in the previous year. This increase is mainly attributable to a favourable working capital change of S$1.5 million for 2020, attributable to higher collections of trade receivables, in contrast with the unfavourable working capital change of S$0.1 million in 2019.

Our Group’s net cash used in investing activities for 2020 amounted to S$0.5 million, a decrease of 61.9% as compared to the S$1.3 million invested in 2019. The lower net cash used in investing activities this year is attributable to the lower volume of investments at Captii investments.

The Group’s net cash used in financing activities for 2020 amounted to S$1.6 million, an increase of 24% as compared to the S$1.3 million invested in the previous year. This increase was mainly due to higher dividend payout to non-controlling interest and lease payments.

# 2020: a mixed year overall and disappointing for some

We expected system sale market conditions to continue to be somewhat challenging for our Group in 2020 and for our managed service contract portfolio to deliver growth. The significant decline in both Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS system sale contract revenues in 2020 evidenced the lumpiness that is to be expected in the contribution of system sale contracts to the Group’s results, especially under the more unusual, adverse conditions brought about by the CoViD-19 pandemic. Unifiedcomms meanwhile, achieved a higher managed service contract revenues, the outperformance of a new contract had more than offset the underperformance of certain existing managed service contracts, within Unifiedcomms.

Although the improved gross profit margin on system sale revenues of GlobeOSS in 2020 had effectively counteracted the decline in Group revenue, we do not expect this to be the trend that can readily be extended in the years ahead. Significant uncertainty and lumpiness is still to be expected in the contribution of system sale contracts to our Group’s future results. The need for our Group to continue to strengthen our managed service contract portfolio and to continue to grow our venture investment portfolio as the basis for delivering steady, if not rapid yet sustainable future growth, remains.

# Challenges and opportunities in 2021 and beyond

The CoViD-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries in our Group’s regions of focus reinstating movement and travel restrictions at year-end. Such restrictions have adversely affected many businesses. The uncertainty of economic recovery from the shock caused by CoViD-19 and the prospect of a protracted economic slowdown or a slow recovery, especially in the Group’s regions of focus, have weighed on the minds of the Group when considering the outlook for the next twelve months.

The impact of CoViD-19 on Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS has fortunately been minimal in the current financial year. This is because these businesses of our Group operate primarily in the field of telecommunications, an essential service in any economy today. In addition, Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS businesses have been made capable of fully-functioning under a work-from-home mode of operation, well ahead of movement control restrictions or lockdown orders being enforced. The Group’s primary customers in the Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS businesses are telecommunications network operators and service providers that have continued to operate normally throughout CoViD-19 restrictions, albeit remotely and through digital engagement, rather than face-to-face interaction. Contracts in-hand continue to be progressed and management of the Group are hopeful that new projects and initiatives requiring our products and services, will continue to be pursued by customers in the year ahead. The possibility remains however, that larger system sale contracts that have yet to be committed in the coming year, may be further deferred, or even abandoned entirely if macroeconomic and industry conditions do not improve significantly. Some managed service contracts of the Group which are impacted by government restrictions or directives arising from CoViD-19 policy measures, may meanwhile continue to show weaker performance.

At Captii Ventures, the Group’s venture investment business, the climate for either business development or funding has been challenging. As a result, certain investees in the Group’s venture investment portfolio had dampened valuations and some faced difficulty in raising further capital. The Group has taken active, early measures to perform impact assessment as well as in assisting investees to plan and manage through a more hostile environment for both business and funding. Investment management activities to assist investees and protect our investments will continue to be the priority at Captii Ventures in the year ahead.

Against this potentially negative macroeconomic backdrop for the future, the Group remains optimistic and will continue to work closely with customers and investees, to minimise the negative impact of CoViD-19 related developments on Group financial performance. The Group has in recent months taken an active and measured approach to managing risks to protect the Group’s people and assets, and will sustain these efforts until the pandemic resolves.

The Group will further the work it has been doing to strengthen the Group’s managed service contract portfolio and will invest even more selectively in the venture investment business. Demand for internet-driven application services for enterprises, in the broad domain of fintech, as well as in internet and handset-app delivered digital media, have been heightened in the current environment. These areas will continue to be the focus for the Group’s venture investment activities, and is expected to complement the organic growth strategies of the Unifiedcomms and GlobeOSS businesses.

# undeRSTAndInG WhAT mATTeRS TO uS

We use a comprehensive materiality assessment to identify priority areas based on the business strategy outlined in our plan. Our materiality assessments were based on the AA1000 Account Ability Principles of Inclusivity and Materiality, as well as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Principles for Defining Report Content – stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality and completeness. Materiality with respect to sustainability reporting, as defined by GRI Standards, includes topics and indicators that reflect the organisation’s significant environmental and social impacts; and would substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.

In 2018, a robust process was undertaken to identify and prioritise the Group’s material Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors. The process was supported by an independent consultant and involved stakeholder consultations, workshops with senior management, an assessment of long-term global trends and an internal review of our businesses.

Through internal discussion and review with the independent consultant, Management have reviewed stakeholders across the Group’s value chain and identified three (3) key stakeholder groups. These are stakeholders defined as having the most influence over and the highest level of interest in the Company’s operations as set out in Exhibit 2.

# EXHIBIT 2. KEY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS

Engagement with customers allows us to receive timely, valuable feedback to improve our service standards.|We engage suppliers to ensure alignment, especially in the areas of safety, our practices and code of conduct.|

The Group’s ESG factors are identified as those that are ranked as high and medium on the materiality matrix (See Exhibit 3). Management will focus sustainability efforts and reporting on these factors that are of the greatest concern to our business and key stakeholder groups.

Captii remains committed to maintaining a safe and productive environment, free from harassment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity and we expect all our employees and individuals that always work at our sites to follow our health and safety policies and procedures and be free from substance abuse.

Our employees and partners are assured of a safe working environment through our Health & Safety and Environment Management system (HSEMS). While the HSEMS serves as a point of reference, additional measures have been taken to cultivate a safety-first culture through various initiatives.

Processes and systems are in place to identify, mitigate and report risks and communicate best practices and we work with our contractors and subcontractors to ensure that they understand our requirements and expectations.

In 2020, there were no incidents of fatalities across Captii’s operations.

The CoViD-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries in our Group’s regions of focus reinstating movement and travel restrictions at year-end. Such restrictions have adversely affected many businesses. The uncertainty of economic recovery from the shock caused by CoViD-19 and the prospect of a protracted economic slowdown or a slow recovery, especially in the Group’s regions of focus, have weighed on the minds of management and the directors of the Group when evaluating our operations to ensure business continuity and the safety of our employees.

Employee well-being and safety has always been one of our top priorities. CoViD-19 has forced multiple phases or full or partial lockdowns imposed by governments in most parts of the world. In Singapore and Malaysia, the governments have put in place a range of safety measures that include Work From Home directives.

# Commitments & Targets

- Strive to raise awareness, maintain vigilance and foster a strong HSE-centric culture particularly at the ground level.
- Leverage technology to drive improvements in safety performance.

The Group has introduced comprehensive safe management measures at our workplaces that included safe entry, social distancing and higher cleanliness to safeguard our employees. The purpose of our measures is to establish and implement a system of Safe Management Measures to provide a safe working environment and minimise risks of further outbreaks.

We have a Health and Safety Committee to ensure that the Company complies with Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994. The Company strives to continue maintain its health & safety standards and drive continuous improvement in our Operational Health and Safety performance.

The Group’s safe management measures require employees at work to wear masks, regular temperature readings and maintain safe physical distancing and reduce physical interaction. We introduced work from home measures for employees, company laptops with VPN access being assigned to all employees.

A host of other safe management measures included staggered working hours and break hours, splitting employees at the workplace into smaller teams, reducing the need for physical meetings and interactions, maintaining physical distance between persons and hand sanitizer placed at entrance for all staff and visitors prior to entering the office.

The Group remains committed to closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic and to minimise its impact on our people.

# Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance

The Board currently comprises five (5) directors, two (2) of whom are Independent Directors and one (1) Non-Executive Director. The Independent Directors make up more than one-third of the Board and Non-Executive Directors make up majority of the Board, thus providing a pivotal role in ensuring that there is balance of power and authority. Each of the Independent Directors is considered independent of management and free of any relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The current Independent Directors bring a wide range of business and financial experience, skills and knowledge necessary for the effective stewardship of the Group.

# The directors in office at the date of this report are disclosed within Table B below.

# Annual Report 2020

# Captii Limited

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

The Board is supported by various committees, namely the AC, NC and RC whose functions are also described below.

As the Executive Chairman is part of the management team, the Board notes that Provision 2.2 of the Code requires that Independent Directors should make up a majority of the Board where the Chairman is not independent, having considered the Board currently comprise majority Non-Executive Directors of which two (2) are independent, the Board viewed that there is a strong independent element on the Board given the size of the Board. The Board believes that the Executive Chairman has always acted and will continue to act at all times in the best interest of shareholders as a whole and will strive to protect and enhance the long-term shareholder values and the financial performance of the Group. The Board also aims to maintain a diversity of expertise, industry knowledge, skills, gender, age and diversity of background among the directors, including the Non-Executive Directors’ professions and experiences, which enable them to provide independent judgement to the Group’s activities.

Having reviewed and considered the composition and diversity of the Board, the Board is of the opinion that, given the scope and nature of the Group’s operations, the present size of the Board is appropriate for effective decision making for the Group’s business, and that no individual or small group of individuals dominates the decisions of the Board. The Board is made up of directors of both gender and who are qualified and experienced in various fields including sales, engineering, business administration, general management, accountancy and finance.

While the Company has not disclosed a board diversity policy, the Board recognises the importance and benefits of composition and diversity on the Board as recommended under the Code. The Board believes that the practices of the Company had adopted are consistent with the intent of Principle 2 of the Code, which requires the Board to have an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interest of the Company.

The criterion for independence is based on the Provisions stated in the Code. The Board considers an “Independent” director as one who has no relationship with the Company, its related corporations, its 5% shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgement with a view to the best interests of the Company.

In addition, pursuant to Rule 210(5)(d) of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST, directors cannot be regarded as independent if:

1. A director who is or has been employed by the Company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three (3) financial years; and
2. A director has an immediate family member who is, or has been in any of the past three (3) financial years, employed by the company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee.

The independence of the Independent Director is subject to the NC’s annual review, based on the Provisions stated in the Code, in particular the rigorous review on the continued independence of Independent Directors who have served for more than nine (9) years from the date of their first appointment.

In respect of each of the two (2) Independent Directors, namely Peng Hock and Paul having served more than nine (9) years, the Board has considered specifically their length of service and their continued independence. The Board determined that the Independent Directors remained independent in character and judgment, and that there were no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the director’s judgment. The Board is of the opinion that their length of service has not, in any way, affected their independence.

Referring to all other directors who have served beyond nine (9) years, the Board does not consider the requirement of their retirement (if any) to be in the best interests of the Company.

The Board is able to exercise objective judgment independently from management and no individual or small group of individuals dominate the decisions of the Board. Pursuant to Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST, effective from 1 January 2022, a director will not be independent if he has been a director for an aggregate period of more than 9 years (whether before or after listing) and his continued appointment as an independent director has not been sought and approved in separate resolutions by (A) all shareholders; and (B) shareholders, excluding the directors and the chief executive officer of the issuer, and associates of such director and chief executive officer.

The Board notes that, for Peng Hock and Paul to continue to be designated as Independent Director, Peng Hock and Paul would have to comply with the requirements of Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST, the Company will seek for shareholders’ approval on both Peng Hock and Paul to continue to be designated as Independent Director in the forthcoming AGM. Should any of the above Independent Directors fail the two-tier voting, he will be re-designated as a Non-Independent Director with effect from 1 January 2022. The Board will appoint new Independent Director(s), if required, to meet the minimum required number of Independent Directors to comply with Rule 210(5)(c) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual within the prescribed timeframe.

Where necessary, the Non-Executive and Independent Directors meet without the presence of Executive Directors or management.

# Principle 3: Chairman and Executive Director

Tze Leng is the Executive Chairman of the Board and Anton is the Executive Director of the Company. They are not related to each other. The Board having considered the number of Non-Executive and Independent Directors on the Board, as well as the size and scope of the affairs and operations of the Group, is of the view that its current structure has a strong independent element which enables the independent exercise of objective judgment on corporate affairs of the Group. This is reinforced by the establishment of the various Committees of which both Tze Leng and Anton are not members.

As the Chairman of the Board, Tze Leng is responsible for providing leadership to the Board and ensuring that the Board functions effectively. He is also responsible for, among others;

1. scheduling meetings of the Board and setting the Board meeting agenda in consultation with the Company’s senior management;

(c) ensuring compliance with the Company’s Provisions on corporate governance;

1. Determining the director’s independence annually;
2. Deciding whether or not each director is able to and has adequately carried out his duties as a director of the Company in particular where the director concerned has multiple board representations;

Deciding the evaluation of the Board’s performance and proposing the objective of performance criteria to the Board;
4. Assessing the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the contributions by each individual director to the effectiveness of the Board.

The roles of the Executive Chairman and Executive Director are separate and their responsibilities are clearly formalised. Supported by the team of Chief Executives from respective business units of the Group, the Executive Chairman is responsible for providing overall leadership in the management of the Group. The Executive Director, who was formerly the Group Chief Executive to 1 September 2017, is primarily responsible for overseeing the venture investment and corporate development activities of the Group. The management and the execution of business policies, strategies, objective and plans of the businesses within the Group as formalised and adopted by the Board, are carried out by the Chief Executive of each business together with the team of key executives reporting to him.

The Board has on 26 February 2014 appointed Peng Hock as the Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director will be available to shareholders where they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of the Executive Chairman or the Executive Director has failed to resolve their concerns or is inappropriate.

Led by the Lead Independent Director, the Non-Executive and Independent Directors meet without the presence of other directors, where necessary.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

At general meetings, shareholders of the Company are given the opportunity to air their views and ask directors or management questions regarding the Company and the Group.

The Company’s Constitution allows a member of the Company to appoint not more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote on their behalf at general meetings. For the time being, the Board is of the view that this is adequate to enable shareholders to participate in general meetings of the Company and is not proposing to amend their Constitution to allow votes in absentia.

There is no provision in the Company’s Constitution that limit the number of proxies for a relevant intermediary which purchases shares on behalf of the CPF investors.

The Company ensures that there are separate resolutions at general meetings on each distinct issue. Each item of special business included in the notice of meetings will be accompanied by the relevant explanatory notes. This is to enable the shareholders to understand the nature and effect of the proposed resolutions.

All directors, including Chairman of the Board and respective Chairmen of the AC, NC and RC are present at general meetings to answer questions from shareholders. The external auditors are also present to assist the directors in addressing shareholders’ queries about the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of their auditors’ report.

The Company prepares minutes of general meetings that include substantial and relevant comments or queries from shareholders relating to the agenda of the meeting, and responses from the Board and management, and makes these minutes available to shareholders at the Company’s Website.

In compliance with Rule 730A(2) of SGX-ST’s Listing Manual, the Company puts all resolutions at the forthcoming general meetings to vote by poll and makes an announcement of the detailed results showing the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages.

In view of the CoViD-19 pandemic, the Company’s forthcoming AGM will be convened and held by electronic means pursuant to the CoViD-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 2020. Alternative arrangements relating to attendance at the AGM via electronic means (i.e. live audio-visual webcast or live audio-only stream), submission of questions to the Chairman of the Meeting in advance of the AGM, addressing of substantial and relevant questions at, or prior to the AGM and appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as the proxy at the AGM, are set out in the Notice of AGM. Shareholders may refer to the Notice of AGM for further information.

The Company does not have a fixed dividend policy. In considering the amount, frequency and form of dividend payments, the Board takes into account the Group’s financial results, cash position, capital requirements of the Group’s growth and development plan, the Company’s retained earnings and other factors. The Company paid interim dividend of 1.25 cents per share on 18 September 2020 and no final dividend has been declared / recommended for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.

# Annual Report 2020

# Captii Limited

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF CAPTII LIMITED

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Captii Limited (the “company”) and its subsidiaries (the “group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the group and the statement of financial position of the company as at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows of the group, and statement of changes in equity of the company for the reporting year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the group and the financial position of the company as at 31 December 2020 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the group and of the changes in equity of the company for the reporting year ended on that date.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current reporting year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# a) Impairment testing of goodwill

Refer to Note 2A “Goodwill”, “Carrying amounts of non-financial assets” and Note 2C “Impairment assessment of goodwill” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, and Note 16 “Intangible assets” for the key assumptions used in impairment testing of goodwill.

As at the reporting year end, the group has goodwill of $10 million, comprising 19% of the group’s total assets, which arose from the acquisition of business. The amounts are allocated to a certain cash generating unit (“CGU”) as at 31 December 2020. The CGU and goodwill are assessed annually for impairment. Management used the value-in-use method to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill. The value-in-use calculation requires management of the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU as well as a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value of the recoverable amount of each CGU. In estimating the future cash flows of the CGU, management forecasted the revenue, growth rates and margins based on presently available information. These estimates require judgement and the determination of the recoverable amount is a key area of focus.

We discussed with management the process used in determining various estimates such as forecasted revenues, growth rates, profit margins, tax rates and discount rates. As the assessment process is complex and highly judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions, our audit procedures included, among others, using our in-house valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the group. We assessed management’s estimates applied in the value-in-use model based on our knowledge of the CGU’s operations, and compared them against historical forecasts and performance. Our in-house valuation specialists also performed a review of management’s methodology, expectations and the discount rate used in the impairment assessment and tested the accuracy of the computations. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive, that is, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill.

# b) Fair value of unquoted investments

Refer to Note 2A “Fair value measurement”, “Financial instruments” and Note 2C “Fair value of unquoted investments” for relevant accounting policies and discussion of significant accounting estimates, Note 19 “Investment in an associate” and Note 20 “Other financial assets” for the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the unquoted investments.

As at 31 December 2020, unquoted investments, comprising mainly of unquoted equity investments and unquoted debt securities, amounted to $11.8 million and represented approximately 22% of the group’s total assets. The group’s investment in an associate is also accounted as fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments, and the carrying value was nil as at end of the reporting year. The fair value of these unquoted investments as at 31 December 2020 were determined with the assistance of independent external specialists and applying valuation methodology that involved difficult and complex management’s judgments because these securities are not traded in an active market. The determination of the fair value of the financial instruments using Level 3 inputs is considerably more subjective given the lack of availability of market-based data. For investments acquired during the year where there is a lack of observable inputs and profits and/or cash flows cannot be reliably determined, management considered various indicators where cost might not be representative of fair value.

We assessed the basis and process used by management in determining the fair value, the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used to revalue the unquoted financial instruments, and whether there were indicators that could adversely affect the valuation of each unquoted investments. The audit team was supported by our in-house valuation specialists to assess whether the valuations arrived at by the group were appropriate by reference to acceptable valuation practice, market practice and SFRS(I) 13. We also assessed the independence, competence and experience of the independent external specialists used by management in assessing their objectivity, professional qualifications and resources. As part of these audit procedures, we assessed the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation, by benchmarking them with external data. Finally, we also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements about the degree of estimation made when valuing these unquoted investments.

# Other information

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the statement by directors and the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the financial reporting standards, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

# Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont’d)

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.
3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.
5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Naveen Sasidaran.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020

# 1. General

Captii Limited (the “company”) is incorporated in Singapore with limited liability. It is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”). The financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and they cover the company (referred to as “parent”) and its subsidiaries.

The board of directors approved and authorised these financial statements for issue on the date of the statement by directors.

The principal activities of the company are those of investment holding and the provision of management services.

The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.

The registered office and principal place of business of the company is located at 140 Paya Lebar Road, #10-14 AZ@Paya Lebar, Singapore 409015.

# CoViD-19 related disclosures

The CoViD-19 pandemic and the aftermath of the pandemic has caused and continues to cause disruptions resulting in uncertainties surrounding the reporting entity’s business, including its working pattern with its existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, and which had and may continue to have an adverse effect on its financial position, financial performance of operations, cash flows and prospects for the foreseeable future. There is significant uncertainty around the medium to long term impact of the CoViD-19 pandemic. Other entities are also evolving and assets held by them may have material uncertainties and / or disclaimers regarding the impact of CoViD-19. These uncertainties give rise to difficulties in making an accurate assessment by management of the future financial impacts on the reporting entity. Management will continue to closely monitor the further economic development and its impact. It is however reasonably probable that the CoViD-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on the reporting entity’s revenues and results for the next reporting year, the extent of which will depend on how long the aftermath of the pandemic lasts.

# Statement of compliance with financial reporting standards

These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)s”) and the related Interpretations to SFRS(I) (“SFRS(I) INT”) as issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council. They are in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 and with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).

# Accounting convention

The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except where a financial reporting standard requires an alternative treatment (such as fair values) as disclosed where appropriate in these financial statements. The accounting policies in the financial reporting standards may not be applied when the effect of applying them is not material. The disclosures required by financial reporting standards may not be provided if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material.

# Basis of preparation of the financial statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Apart from those involving estimations, management has made judgements in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies. The areas requiring management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgements, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in Note 2C, where applicable.

# Basis of presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements made up to the end of the reporting year of the company and all of its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements are the financial statements of the group (the parent and its subsidiaries) presented as those of a single economic entity and are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All significant intragroup balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the reporting entity obtains control of the investee and cease when the reporting entity loses control of the investee.

# Annual Report 2020

# Captii Limited

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020

# 1. General (cont’d)

Basis of presentation (cont’d)

Changes in the group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for within equity as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. The carrying amounts of the group’s and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. When the group loses control of a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities and related equity components of the former subsidiary. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date when control is lost and is subsequently accounted as equity investments in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments.

The company’s separate financial statements have been prepared on the same basis, and as permitted by the Companies Act, Chapter 50, the company’s separate statement of comprehensive income is not presented.

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information

# 2A. Significant accounting policies

Revenue recognition

The financial reporting standard on revenue from contracts with customers establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer (which excludes estimates of variable consideration that are subject to constraints, such as right of return exists, trade discounts, volume rebates and changes to the transaction price arising from modifications), net of any related sales taxes and excluding any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. An asset (goods or services) is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that asset. As a practical expedient the effects of any significant financing component is not adjusted if the payment for the good or service will be within one year.

Distinct goods or services in a series – For distinct goods or services in a series such as routine or recurring service contracts where the promise under the contract is for a specified quantity of goods or services that meets the over time criteria or is a stand-ready or single continuous service and if the nature of each good or service is distinct, substantially the same and has the same pattern of transfer or each time increment is distinct, then revenue is recognised at the amount that the entity has the right to bill a fixed amount for each unit of goods or service provided.

Distinct goods or services created over time – For long-term service contracts and projects for developing an asset, the customer value is created over time during the contract period and it is accounted for as a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. This is because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the entity’s performance in processing each transaction as and when each transaction is processed; the performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or the performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The revenue is recognised over time by using the input method. For the input method, the revenue is recognised on the basis of the efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation such as costs incurred, relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.

Provisions for losses on contracts – When the current estimates of the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer, and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is made as soon as the loss becomes evident. An adjustment is also made to reflect the effects of the customer’s credit risk. The loss on a contract is reported as an additional contract cost (an operating expense), and not as a reduction of revenue or a non-operating expense.

Other income

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

Government grants

Government grants are recognised at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with and that the grants will be received. Grants in recognition of specific expenses are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. Grants related to assets are presented in the statement of financial position by recognising the grants as deferred income that is recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful lives of the assets and in the proportions in which depreciation expense on those assets is recognised.

# 2. Significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (cont’d)

# 2A. Significant accounting policies (cont’d)

Employee benefits

Certain subsidiaries have defined contribution retirement benefit plans in which employees are entitled to join upon fulfilling certain conditions. The entity contributes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of the salary of each participating employee. Contributions are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

Contributions to government managed retirement benefit plans such as the Central Provident Fund in Singapore and Employees Provident Fund in Malaysia which specify the employer’s obligations are dealt with as defined contribution retirement benefit plans. For employee leave entitlement the expected cost of short-term employee benefits in the form of compensated absences is recognised in the case of accumulating compensated absences, when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences; and in the case of non-accumulating compensated absences, when the absences occur. A liability for bonuses is recognised where the entity is contractually obliged or where there is constructive obligation based on past practice.

Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowings and are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method.

Foreign currency transactions

The functional currency of the company is the Singapore dollar as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in the functional currency at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. At each end of the reporting year, recorded monetary balances and balances measured at fair value that are denominated in non-functional currencies are reported at the rates ruling at the end of the reporting year and fair value measurement dates respectively. All realised and unrealised exchange adjustment gains and losses are dealt with in profit or loss except when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in other comprehensive income, any exchange component of that gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. The presentation is in the functional currency.

Translation of financial statements of other entities

Each entity in the group determines the appropriate functional currency as it reflects the primary economic environment in which the relevant reporting entity operates. In translating the financial statements of such an entity for incorporation in the consolidated financial statements in the presentation currency, the assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at the end of the reporting year rates of exchange and the income and expense items for each statement presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange for the reporting year. The resulting translation adjustments (if any) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity until the disposal of that relevant reporting entity.

Income tax

Income taxes are accounted using the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognised in the financial statements or tax returns. The measurements of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on provisions of the enacted or substantially enacted tax laws; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current and deferred income taxes are recognised as income or as an expense in profit or loss unless the tax relates to items that are recognised in the same or a different period outside profit or loss. For such items recognised outside profit or loss the current tax and deferred tax are recognised (a) in other comprehensive income if the tax is related to an item recognised in other comprehensive income and (b) directly in equity if the tax is related to an item recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same income tax authority and entity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realised.

A deferred tax amount is recognised for all temporary differences, unless the deferred tax amount arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which (i) is not a business combination; and (ii) at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). A deferred tax liability or asset is recognised for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the reporting entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the taxable temporary difference and it is probable that the taxable temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or for deductible temporary differences, they will not reverse in the foreseeable future and they cannot be utilised against taxable profits.

Plant and equipment

Plant and equipment are carried at cost on initial recognition and after initial recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to allocate the gross carrying amounts of the assets less their residual values over their estimated useful lives of each part of an item of these assets. The annual rates of depreciation are as follows:

|Computers, telecommunications, research and development equipment|–|3 to 5 years|
|---|---|---|
|Office equipment, furniture, motor vehicle and renovation|–|5 years|

An asset is depreciated when it is available for use until it is derecognised even if during that period the item is idle. Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.

The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of plant and equipment is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item and is recognised in profit or loss. The residual value and the useful life of an asset is reviewed at least at each end of the reporting year and, if expectations differ significantly from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate, and the depreciation charge for the current and future periods are adjusted.

Cost also includes acquisition cost, borrowing cost capitalised and any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset or component to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequent costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss when they are incurred.

Right-of-use assets

The right-of-use assets are accounted and presented as if they were owned such as plant and equipment and are depreciated over the lease terms.

Investment property

Investment property is property (land or a building or part of a building or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset under a finance lease) or held under a finance lease to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for: (a) use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or (b) sale in the ordinary course of business. It includes an investment property in the course of construction.

After initial recognition at cost including transaction costs, the fair value model is used to measure the investment property at fair value as of the end of the reporting year. A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment property is included in profit or loss for the reporting year in which it arises. The fair values are measured periodically on a systematic basis annually by external independent valuers having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of property being valued.

Leases of lessee

A lease conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. A right-of-use asset is capitalised in the statement of financial position, measured at the present value of the unavoidable future lease payments to be made over the lease term. A liability corresponding to the capitalised lease is also recognised, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of any future restoration, removal or dismantling costs. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term and an interest expense on the recognised lease liability (included in finance costs). Short-term leases of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets (such as personal computers and small office equipment) where an accounting policy choice exists under the lease standard whereby the lease payments are expensed to profit or loss as incurred on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term.

Intangible assets

An identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance is recognised as an intangible asset at acquisition cost if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. After initial recognition, an intangible asset with finite useful life is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. An intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity.

# Intangible assets (cont’d)

The amortisable amount of an intangible asset with finite useful life is allocated on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life from the point at which the asset is ready for use. The useful lives are as follows:

|Deferred development costs (completed)|–|5 years|
|---|---|---|
|Intellectual property|–|5 years|

Development costs – Development costs are typically internally generated intangible assets. Costs incurred in relation to individual projects are capitalised only when the future economic benefit of the project is probable and the following main conditions are met: (i) the development costs can be measured reliably, (ii) the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained and (iii) therefore it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.

# Subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an entity including unincorporated and special purpose entity that is controlled by the reporting entity and the reporting entity is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The existence and effect of substantive potential voting rights that the reporting entity has the practical ability to exercise (that is, substantive rights) are considered when assessing whether the reporting entity controls another entity. In the reporting entity’s separate financial statements, an investment in a subsidiary is accounted for at cost less any allowance for impairment in value. Impairment loss recognised in profit or loss for a subsidiary is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in a subsidiary are not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realised in a current market exchange.

# Associates

An associate is an entity including an unincorporated entity in which the reporting entity has a significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the reporting entity. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The group’s investment in an associate is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss financial assets in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments (see note on financial instruments below).

# Joint arrangement – joint venture

A joint arrangement (that is, either a joint operation or a joint venture, depending on the rights and obligations of the jointly controlling parties to the arrangement), is one in which the reporting entity is a party to an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control, which is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement; it exists only when decisions about the relevant activities (that is, activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a joint venture, the parties with joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

The reporting interests in joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method in accordance with the financial reporting standard on investments in associates and joint ventures.

Under the equity method, the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor’s share of the investee’s net assets. The carrying value and the net book value of the investment in the joint venture are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realised in a current market exchange. The investor’s profit or loss includes its share of the investee’s profit or loss and the investor’s other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee’s other comprehensive income. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the reporting entity’s interest in the relevant joint venture are not recognised except to the extent that the reporting entity has an obligation. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the reporting entity and a joint venture are recognised in the financial statements only to the extent of unrelated reporting entity’s interests in the joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

Accounting policies of joint ventures are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the reporting entity. The reporting entity discontinues the use of the equity method from the date that when its investment ceases to be a joint venture and accounts for the investment in accordance with the financial reporting standard on financial instruments from that date. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained in the former joint venture is measured at fair value at the date that it ceases to be a joint venture.

Business combinations

There were no acquisitions during the reporting year.

Non-controlling interests

The non-controlling interest is equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the reporting entity as the parent. The non-controlling interest is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, separately from the equity of the owners of the company. For each business combination, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree (subsidiary) is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Where the non-controlling interest is measured at fair value, the valuation techniques and key model inputs used are disclosed in the relevant note. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income is attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Goodwill

Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognised.

Goodwill is recognised as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (a) over (b); (a) being the aggregate of: (i) the consideration transferred which generally requires acquisition-date fair value; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations (measured either at fair value or as the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets); and (iii) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree; and (b) being the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with the financial reporting standard on business combinations.

After initial recognition, goodwill acquired in a business combination is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, goodwill and also any intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or any intangible asset not yet available for use are tested for impairment, at least annually. Goodwill impairment is not reversed in any circumstances.

For the purpose of impairment testing since the acquisition date of the business combination, goodwill is allocated to each cash-generating unit, or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree were assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is not larger than a segment.

Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost (weighted average method) and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

Carrying amounts of non-financial assets

Irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, an annual impairment test is performed at about the same time every year on an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life or an intangible asset not yet available for use. The carrying amount of other non-financial assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year for indications of impairment and where an asset is impaired, it is written down through profit or loss to its estimated recoverable amount. The impairment loss is the excess of the carrying amount over the recoverable amount and is recognised in profit or loss. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. When the fair value less costs of disposal method is used, any available recent market transactions are taken into consideration. When the value-in-use method is adopted, in assessing the value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

# Carrying amounts of non-financial assets (cont’d)

For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). At the end of each reporting year, non-financial assets other than goodwill with impairment loss recognised in prior periods are assessed for possible reversal of the impairment. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been measured, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

# Financial instruments

Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments:

A financial asset or a financial liability is recognised in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) are recognised and derecognised, as applicable, using trade date accounting or settlement date accounting. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset. A financial liability is removed from the statement of financial position when, and only when, it is extinguished, that is, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

At initial recognition the financial asset or financial liability is measured at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.

# Classification and measurement of financial assets:

1. Financial asset classified as measured at amortised cost: A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”), that is (a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Typically trade and other receivables, bank and cash balances are classified in this category.
2. Financial asset that is a debt asset instrument classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”): There were no financial assets classified in this category at reporting year end date.
3. Financial asset that is an equity investment measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”): There were no financial assets classified in this category at reporting year end date.
4. Financial asset classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”): All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL. In addition, on initial recognition, management may irrevocably designate a financial asset as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.

# Classification and measurement of financial liabilities:

Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) in either of the following circumstances: (1) the liabilities are managed, evaluated and reported internally on a fair value basis; or (2) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. All other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Reclassification of any financial liability is not permitted.

# Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows include bank and cash balances, on demand deposits and any highly liquid debt asset instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. For the consolidated statement of cash flows, the item includes cash and cash equivalents less cash subject to restriction that form an integral part of cash management.

Fair value measurement

The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, market observable data to the extent possible is used. If the fair value of an asset or a liability is not directly observable, an estimate is made using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs (eg by use of the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar items, discounted cash flow analysis, or option pricing models refined to reflect the issuer’s specific circumstances). Inputs used are consistent with the characteristics of the asset / liability that market participants would take into account. The entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfil a liability is not taken into account as relevant when measuring fair value.

Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the measurement are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices). Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.

The carrying values of current financial instruments not carried at fair values approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of such current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value. The fair values of non-current financial instruments may not be disclosed separately unless there are significant differences at the end of the reporting year and in such event, the fair values are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements.

# 2B. Other explanatory information

Provisions

A liability or provision is recognised when there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A provision is made using best estimates of the amount required in settlement and where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount recognised is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. Changes in estimates are reflected in profit or loss in the reporting year they occur.

Segment reporting

The reporting entity discloses financial and descriptive information about its consolidated reportable segments. Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. Operating segments are components about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. Generally, financial information is reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to operating segments.

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties

The critical judgements made in the process of applying the accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting year are discussed below. These estimates and assumptions are periodically monitored to ensure they incorporate all relevant information available at the date when financial statements are prepared. However, this does not prevent actual figures differing from estimates.

# 2C. Critical judgements, assumptions and estimation uncertainties (cont’d)

CoViD-19 pandemic and the aftermath

Management has to exercise judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses at the end of the reporting year. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors including the impact of the CoViD-19 pandemic, and they form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The nature and the carrying amount of such assets and liabilities are disclosed with further details in the relevant Notes to these financial statements. It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge that outcomes within the next reporting year are likely to be different from the current assumptions as the anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected and the variation may be material and could require material adjustments to the carrying amounts of the balances affected.

Impairment assessment of goodwill

An assessment is made annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment loss, based on the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units (“CGU”). The recoverable amounts of the CGUs was determined based on value-in-use calculations and these calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates as disclosed in Note 16C. The assessment process is complex and highly judgemental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions. Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates. The carrying amount of the group’s goodwill as at the end of the reporting year was $10,061,000 (2019: $10,042,000).

Development costs

Development costs are capitalised as intangible assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2A. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project has reached a defined milestone according to an established plan. Management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, discount rates to be applied and the expected period of profits. Should a project fail to substantiate its estimated feasibility or life cycle or other events or changes in circumstances arise that indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, material development costs may be required to be written off in future periods. The carrying amount has been disclosed in the Note on intangible assets.

Expected credit loss allowance on trade receivables

The allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the lifetime ECL for trade receivables. In measuring the expected credit losses, management considers all reasonable and supportable information such as the reporting entity’s past experience at collecting receipts, any increase in the number of delayed receipts in the portfolio past the average credit period, and forward looking information such as forecasts of future economic conditions (including the impact of the CoViD-19 pandemic). The carrying amounts might change materially within the next reporting year but these changes may not arise from assumptions or other sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year. The carrying amount is disclosed in the Note on trade and other receivables.

Revenue recognised over time

The entity has revenue where the performance obligation is satisfied over time. Revenue is recognised over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. A single method is applied consistently for measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time. Judgment is required when selecting a method (output or input methods) for measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation. Assessing the satisfaction of performance obligations over time requires judgment and the consideration of many criteria that should be met to qualify such as whether the customer presently is obligated to pay for an asset, whether the customer has legal title, whether the entity has transferred physical possession of the asset, whether the customer has assumed the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset, and whether the customer has accepted the asset. Events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected. Even if the events anticipated under the assumptions occur, actual results are still likely to be different from the estimates since other anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected and the variation may be material. The related account balances at the end of the reporting year are disclosed in the Notes on revenues, contract assets and contract liabilities.

Measurement of impairment of subsidiaries

When a subsidiary is in net equity deficit and has suffered operating losses, the recoverable amount of the investee is estimated to assess whether the investment in the investee has suffered any impairment. This measurement requires significant judgement. An estimate is made of the future profitability of the investee, and the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flows. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects. It is reasonably possible, based on existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next reporting year that are different from assumptions could require adjustments to the carrying amount of the investments in subsidiaries. The carrying amount of the company’s specific assets at the end of the reporting year affected by the assumptions is $11,000,000 (2019: $11,000,000).

Fair value of unquoted investments

If a financial asset is not traded in an active market or if the quoted price is not readily and regularly available, the fair value is established by using valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. This measurement requires significant judgement. The fair value measurement requires the selection among a range of different valuation methodologies, making estimates about expected future cash flows and discount rates. The assumptions and the fair values are disclosed in the Notes on other financial assets and investment in an associate.

# 3. Related party relationships and transactions

The financial reporting standard on related party disclosures requires the reporting entity to disclose: (a) transactions with its related parties; and (b) relationships between parents and subsidiaries irrespective of whether there have been transactions between those related parties. A party is related to a party if the party controls, or is controlled by, or can significantly influence or is significantly influenced by the other party.

# 4. Financial information by operating segments

# 4A. Information about reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities

Disclosure of information about operating segments, products and services, the geographical areas, and the major customers are made as required by the financial reporting standard on operating segments. This disclosure standard has no impact on the reported financial performance or financial position of the reporting entity.

For management purposes, the reporting entity is organised into the three major strategic operating segments that offer different products and services. Such a structural organisation is determined by the nature of risks and returns associated with each business segment and it defines the management structure as well as the internal reporting system. It represents the basis on which the management reports the primary segment information that is available and that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the performance. They are managed separately because each business requires different strategies.

The segments and the types of products and services are as follows:

- Unifiedcomms – Segment for content-driven mobile value-added services (“VAS”), messaging and signalling systems, solutions and managed services.
- GlobeOSS – Segment for mobile network operation support systems, solutions and managed services.
- Captii Ventures – Segment for strategic investment in early and late-stage technology ventures.
- Others – Segment for investment holding and operational headquarters of the group.

Inter-segment sales are measured on the basis that the entity actually used to price the transfers. Internal transfer pricing policies of the reporting entity are as far as practicable based on market prices. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

The following tables illustrate the information about the reportable segment profit or loss, assets and liabilities.

The other unrecognised deferred tax assets for the tax losses is available for unlimited future periods. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the above balance as the future profit streams are not probable against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. The realisation of the future income tax benefits from tax loss carried forwards and temporary differences from capital allowances is available for an unlimited future period subject to the conditions imposed by laws of the countries in which the entities in the group operates, including the retention of majority shareholders as defined.

# 12. Earnings per share

The following table illustrates the numerators and denominators used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share of no par value:

| |Group| | |
|---|---|---|---|
| | |2020|2019|
|$’000|Profit, net of tax attributable to owners of the company|1,288|2,076|

| | | | | |Number of shares|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | |2020|2019| |
|’000|Weighted average number of equity shares| | |31,957|31,957|

The weighted average number of equity shares refers to share in circulation during the reporting year.

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit, net of tax attributable to owners of the company by the above weighted average number of ordinary shares.

Diluted earnings per share for the reporting years are computed using the same basis as basic earnings per share as there are no potential dilutive ordinary shares.

Direct operating expenses arising from investment property that did not generate rental income during the reporting year (55) (48)

As at 31 December 2020, the strata title of the investment property has not been issued by Department of Director General of Lands and Mines in Malaysia.

The investment property has been pledged for bank facilities (see Note 28C).

The fair value of the investment property was measured in December 2020 based on the highest and best use method to reflect the actual market state and circumstances as of the end of the reporting year. The fair value was based on a valuation made by C H Williams Talhar & Wong, a firm of independent professional valuers, which hold a recognised and relevant professional qualification with sufficient recent experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year. Management determined that the highest and best use of the assets is the current use and that it would provide maximum value to market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets.

# 16A. Deferred development costs

Deferred development costs mainly comprise staff costs, operating expenses and depreciation expenses for the development of the group’s proprietary mobile software and these have an average remaining amortisation period of 2 years (2019: 2 years).

# 16B. Intellectual property

Intellectual property comprises rights and titles relating to mobile software.

# 16C. Goodwill

Goodwill acquired through business combination has been allocated to its subsidiaries, Unified Communications Pte Ltd, Postpay Asia Sdn Bhd, Postpay Sdn Bhd, Postpay Technology Sdn Bhd, Adzentrum Sdn Bhd, Unified Communications (Private) Limited and Ahead Mobile Sdn Bhd for the purpose of impairment testing. The carrying amount is disclosed above.

The goodwill was tested for impairment at the end of the reporting year. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit (“CGU’’) exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or its value-in-use. The recoverable amount of the CGU has been measured based on the value-in-use method.

The value-in-use was determined by management using discounted cash flow valuation technique. The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations, which are unobservable inputs, are as follows:

|Unobservable inputs|2020|2019|
|---|---|---|
|Estimated discount rates that reflect current market assessments at the risks specific to the CGU|13.09%|13.22%|
|Growth rates based on management estimate forecasts and not exceeding the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets|2%|2%|
|Cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans approved by management|5 years|5 years|

The value-in-use is a recurring fair value measurement (Level 3).

Management also performed sensitivity analysis over the key inputs above and noted that no reasonably possible change in any of these inputs would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to fall below its carrying amount.

# 19. Investment in an associate (cont’d)

It is not meaningful to present the summarised financial information as the investment in associate is accounted as fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) financial assets in accordance with financial reporting standard on financial instruments.

On 6 September 2019, the group announced that a writ of summons and statement of claim (“Writ”) has been issued by its associated company, OOPA Pte Ltd (“OOPA”) against (i) Mr Bui Sy Phong; (ii) Telio Pte Ltd (as a nominal defendant), a Singapore incorporated company of which Mr Bui is a sole shareholder. Under the Writ, OOPA is claiming against Mr Bui, for inter alia, the following:

- (a) 100% of the shares in Telio and/or such associated company of Telio (or such percentage or number of shares as determined by the High Court of Singapore);
- (b) An order that Mr Bui compensates OOPA in equity for breaches of director’s duties owed by him to OOPA; and
- (c) An account of profits received pursuant to the breaches of director’s duties owed by him to OOPA.

The proceedings relating to the above are ongoing as at the date of this report.

In 2019, management impaired the investment value to nil in accordance to SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. As at the date of this report, management is of the view that it is probable that the outcome of the Writ is favourable to OOPA, which may potentially increase the fair value of OOPA, and hence represent a contingent asset to OOPA. As SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets does not permit the recognition of contingent assets, management has not recognised the said fair value of OOPA.

In future, when the realisation of such contingent asset becomes virtually certain, management shall recognise the related asset in the financial statements.

# 20C. Fair value measurements (Level 3) recognised in the statement of financial position

The group adopted the following valuation methodologies in estimating the fair values of the investments:

(a) Cost approach: This is applied to estimate fair value of companies in very preliminary development stages where revenue forecasts are difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty, and assumes the book value or cost of an asset approximates its fair value. Adjustments, such as impairment allowance, are made to assets on a case-by-case basis if this assumption does not hold true.

(b) Option Pricing Model (“OPM”): The OPM, which applies the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing, is a generally accepted valuation methodology used in estimating fair values of early stage companies, in particular those with different classes of shares. In applying the OPM to determine the fair value of an investee, management considers terms such as level of seniority among the securities, dividend policy, conversion ratios, and cash allocations of the various stockholders’ agreements with the investee that would affect the distributions to each class of equity upon a liquidity event. In addition, the method implicitly considers the effect of the liquidation preference as of the future liquidation date, not as of the valuation date.

(c) Implied Enterprise Value (“Implied EV”): The implied EV model estimates the enterprise value based on an adjusted implied EV/Revenue multiple and applies the OPM model based on Black-Scholes model, to allocate the estimated enterprise value to various classes of shares.

The key assumptions used in applying the OPM and implied EV models which are unobservable inputs, are as follows:

|Unobservable inputs|2020|2019|Sensitivity of inputs to fair value|
|---|---|---|---|
|Risk free rates (range)|0.15% – 2.86%|1.53% – 3.10%|Increase (decrease) of the inputs would result in decrease (increase) in fair values|
|Asset volatility (range)|27.92% – 100%|24.21% – 119.46%| |
|Expected terms (years)|1.33 to 3.10|0.55 to 5| |

The group has the policy to regularly assess and evaluate the appropriate valuation methodologies in ascertaining the fair value of the investments.

Certain trade receivables relating to a project of a subsidiary has been pledged for bank facilities (see Note 28A).

The expected credit losses (“ECL”) on the above trade receivables are based on the simplified approach to measuring ECL which uses a lifetime ECL allowance approach for all trade receivables recognised from initial recognition of these assets. These assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due for measuring the ECL. The allowance matrix is based on the historical observed default rates (over a period of 36 months over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates including the impact of the CoViD-19 pandemic). At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. The ageing of the assets is as follows:

The amounts are written off when there are indications that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery or the failure of a debtor to make contractual payments over an extended period. There are no collateral held as security and other credit enhancements for the trade receivables.

As part of the process of setting customer credit limits, different credit terms are used. The average credit period generally granted to trade customers is between 30 to 90 days (2019: 30 to 90 days). But some customers take a longer period to settle the amounts.

# 22. Trade and other receivables (cont’d)

Other receivables:

Other receivables are subject to the ECL model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. The other receivables can be graded for credit risk individually. At inception, they are recorded net of expected 12 month credit losses. At each reporting date, an evaluation is made whether there is a significant change in credit risk by comparing the debtor’s credit risk at initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified cash flows) with the credit risk at the reporting date (based on the modified cash flows). Adjustment to the loss allowance is made for any increase or decrease in credit risk. At the end of the reporting year a loss allowance is recognised at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses if there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition including the impact of the CoViD-19 pandemic. No loss allowance was necessary for other receivables of the group. A loss allowance of $497,000 (2019: $469,000) has been recognised for other receivables of the company.

Other receivables of the group and company are normally with no fixed terms and therefore there is no maturity. Other receivables are regarded as of low credit risk if they have a low risk of default and the debtor has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term. The methodology applied for impairment loss depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The contract assets are entity’s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on the contracts. The contract assets are transferred to the receivables when the rights become unconditional. The entity recognises revenue for each respective performance obligation when control of the product or service transfers to the customer.

The increase of contract assets are due to lower amount billed during the year.

Contract assets are subject to the ECL model under the financial reporting standard on financial instruments. No loss allowance was necessary as at end of the reporting year.

|Group and Company|Number of shares issued|Share capital|
|---|---|---|
|Ordinary shares of no par value:|31,957 ’000|31,948|

The ordinary shares of no par value are fully paid, carry one vote each and have no right to fixed income. The company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Capital management:

The objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the reporting entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for owners and benefits for other stakeholders, and to provide an adequate return to owners by pricing the sales commensurately with the level of risk. The management sets the amount of capital to meet its requirements and the risk taken. There were no changes in the approach to capital management during the reporting year. The management manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it where necessary or possible in the light of changes in conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the management may adjust the amount of dividends paid to owners, return capital to owners, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.

In order to maintain its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange, the company has to have share capital with at least a free float of 10% of the shares. The company met the capital requirement on its initial listing and the rules limiting treasury share purchases mean it will continue to satisfy that requirement, as it did throughout the reporting year. Management receives a report from the share registrars frequently on substantial share interests showing the non-free float to ensure continuing compliance with the 10% limit throughout the reporting year.

# 25. Share capital (cont’d)

Capital management (cont’d):

The management does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to support its business and to add value for shareholders. The key discipline adopted is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed and the cost of that capital. There are no significant external borrowings. The debt-to-adjusted capital ratio does not provide a meaningful indicator of the risk of borrowing.

The lease liabilities above do not include the short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value underlying assets. Variable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate or based on a percentage of revenue are not included from the initial measurement of the lease liabilities and the right-of-use assets.

The leases are for office space. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants, but leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised is 5.4% (2019: 6.15%) per year.

The interest expense on lease liabilities of $36,000 (2019: $9,000) was included in finance cost.

A summary of the maturity analysis of lease liabilities is disclosed in Note 30E. Total cash outflows from leases are shown in the statement of cash flows. The related right-of-use assets are disclosed in Note 14.

# 30B. Financial risk management

The main purpose for holding or issuing financial instruments is to raise and manage the finances for the entity’s operating, investing and financing activities. There are exposures to the financial risks on the financial instruments such as credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk comprising interest rate, currency risk and price risk exposures. Management has certain practices for the management of financial risks and action to be taken in order to manage the financial risks. The guidelines include the following:

1. Minimise interest rate, currency, credit and market risks for all kinds of transactions.
2. Maximise the use of “natural hedge”: favouring as much as possible the natural off-setting of sales and costs and payables and receivables denominated in the same currency and therefore put in place hedging strategies only for the excess balance. The same strategy is pursued with regard to interest rate risk.
3. All financial risk management activities are carried out and monitored by senior management staff.
4. All financial risk management activities are carried out following acceptable market practices.
5. Consideration is given to investing in financial instruments in accordance with the investment strategy of the reporting entity.

There have been no changes to the exposures to risk; the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk.

The group and company are exposed to currency and interest rate risks. There are no arrangements to reduce such risk exposures through derivatives and other hedging instruments.

# 30C. Fair value of financial instruments

The analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These include the significant financial instruments stated at amortised cost and at fair value in the statement of financial position. The carrying values of current financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and the disclosures of fair value are not made when the carrying amount of current financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.

# 30D. Credit risk on financial assets

Financial assets that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk and failures by counterparties to discharge their obligations in full or in a timely manner. These arise principally from cash balances with banks, cash equivalents, receivables and other financial assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk is the total of the fair value of the financial assets at the end of the reporting year. Credit risk on cash balances with banks and any other financial instruments is limited because the counter-parties are entities with acceptable credit ratings. For expected credit losses (“ECL”) on financial assets, the three-stage approach in the financial reporting standard on financial instruments is used to measure the impairment allowance. Under this approach, the financial assets move through the three stages as their credit quality changes.

However, a simplified approach is permitted by the financial reporting standards on financial instruments for financial assets that do not have a significant financing component, such as trade receivables and contract assets. Management adopts the simplified approach to measure the impairment loss for financial assets. On initial recognition, a day-1 loss is recorded equal to the 12 month ECL (or lifetime ECL for trade receivables), unless the assets are considered credit impaired. For credit risk on trade receivables, contract assets and other financial assets, an ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the debtors and an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Reviews and assessments of credit exposures in excess of designated limits are made. Renewals and reviews of credits limits are subject to the same review process.

Note 24 discloses the maturity of the cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of the standard on financial instruments. There was no identified impairment loss.

# 30E. Liquidity risk – financial liabilities maturity analysis

The liquidity risk refers to the difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. It is expected that all the liabilities will be settled at their contractual maturity. The average credit period taken to settle trade payables is about 30 to 60 days (2019: 30 to 60 days). The other payables are with short-term durations. The classification of the financial assets is shown in the statement of financial position as they may be available to meet liquidity needs and no further analysis is deemed necessary.

The undiscounted amounts on the borrowings with floating interest rates are determined by reference to the conditions existing at the reporting date.

The company provides financial guarantees to financial institutions for banking facilities granted to subsidiaries (see Note 28). These financial guarantees are provided without charge.

Financial guarantee contracts – For issued financial guarantee contracts, the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee could be called. At the end of the reporting year, no claims on the financial guarantees are expected to be payable. The following table shows the maturity analysis of the contingent liabilities from financial guarantees:

|Company| | |
|Financial guarantee contracts – in favour of subsidiaries|970| |
|2019|$’000| |
|Financial guarantee contracts – in favour of subsidiaries| |1,652|

Financial guarantee contracts if significant are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the amount of the loss allowance determined in accordance the financial reporting standard on financial instruments and (b) the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of the financial reporting standard on revenue from contracts with customers.

The undrawn borrowing facilities are available for operating activities and to settle other commitments. Borrowing facilities are maintained to ensure funds are available for the operations.

There is exposure to foreign currency risk as part of the group’s and company’s normal business.

|A hypothetical 10% strengthening in the exchange rate of the respective functional currencies against US dollars with all other variables held constant would have an adverse effect on profit before tax of| |(476)| |(568)|

The above table shows sensitivity to a hypothetical percentage variation in the functional currencies of the group’s companies against the relevant material non-functional foreign currencies. The sensitivity rate used is the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. For a similar rate weakening of the functional currencies against the relevant foreign currencies above, there would be comparable impacts in the opposite direction on profit or loss.

The hypothetical changes in exchange rates are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The sensitivity analysis is disclosed for each non-functional currency to which the entity has significant exposure at end of the reporting year. The analysis above has been carried out on the basis that there are no hedged transactions.

In management’s opinion, the above sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the foreign currency risks as the historical exposure does not reflect the exposure in future.

# 30H. Equity price risk

There are instruments in equity shares, related derivatives or similar instruments. As a result, such investments are exposed to both currency risk and market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities. The fair values of these assets and sensitivity analysis are disclosed in Notes 19 and 20.

# 31. Contingent liabilities (cont’d)

# (b) Litigation

On 19 November 2013, Unified Telecom Private Limited (“UTPL”), a joint venture of Unified Communications Pte Ltd (“UCPL”), filed a petition to the High Court of Delhi, New Delhi in India under Section 9 of India Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to obtain interim relief on the protection of assets currently under the custody of a former customer, a mobile telecoms network operator and service provider in India (the “Telco”), and to deny the penalty claims by the Telco against UTPL.

The Telco had via a letter issued in July 2013 alleged that UTPL is liable for a sum of INR 11.3 crore (approximately $2.1 million) for damages and expenditure incurred in connection with the contract during its currency.

Legal advice has been sought from reputable law firms in both India and Singapore with good credentials in handling contract litigation and dispute resolution, to review and advise on the merit of this claim by the Telco on UTPL. Based on the legal opinions obtained from the law firm concerned, management is of the view that UTPL has full rights and title to the assets and should be entitled to demand their return, and that the Telco’s claim against UTPL has no legal merit. Accordingly, external legal counsels in Singapore and India have been appointed to advise and represent UCPL and UTPL to pursue legal recourse.

As announced by the company on 16 January 2015, the hearing on the petition filed by UTPL which was originally scheduled to be heard on 23 April 2014, having been adjourned on several occasions, was dismissed by the High Court, as the Telco had initiated the arbitration proceedings before a tribunal. The High Court was of the view that the matter should be resolved through arbitration proceedings since the tribunal had already been constituted.

In 2015, UTPL commenced an application pursuant to Section 17 of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 for, amongst others, the return of the assets. However, the learned Arbitrator dismissed the application, but directed Telco to ensure the safety of and protect the assets from any damage during the period the Hardware is lying in Telco’s premises.

A number of procedural hearings have been held by the Arbitrator to cross examine the affidavits of the admissions and denial documents relating to the aforesaid claim and counterclaims throughout the years. The case is currently at the stage of evidence. On 22 August 2019, the Arbitrator allowed UTPL’s application for inspection and production of the documents referred to by the Telco’s witness in the course of cross examination in which to be produced by the Telco on 5 September 2019.

On 5 September 2019, the Telco raised a procedural objection under the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act 2015, which is pending determination by the Arbitrator before cross examination of witnesses may proceed.

Due to the CoViD-19 pandemic, no hearings were scheduled in 2020. In 2021, there were two hearings which took place on 15 February 2021 and 19 February 2021 respectively. The Arbitrator had directed both parties to file written submissions for seeking extension of time by 26 February 2021.

Subsequent to the written submission filing, the case is pending decision by the Arbitrator.

In the opinion of management, no material losses are expected to arise pertaining to the aforesaid contingent matter.

# 32. Changes and adoption of financial reporting standards

For the current reporting year, new or revised financial reporting standards were issued by the Singapore Accounting Standards Council. Those applicable to the reporting entity are listed below. These applicable new or revised standards did not require any significant modification of the measurement methods or the presentation in the financial statements.
