On behalf of the Board and Management, I am pleased to present Synagie’s Annual Report for FY2018.

FY2018 was an exciting year for us. The Group set a new revenue record as our revenue grew 99.9% year-on-year (“YOY”) to S$16.1 million. The Group’s e-commerce sales surged by 66.8%, due to higher demand from online consumers for its Brand Partners’ products. The Group also achieved notable growth from its business expansion into Malaysia with a maiden contribution of 6.3% to its total sales in FY2018 as it completed its full year operations. Additionally, the Group’s Brand Partners grew by 45.2% to more than 270 by end of 2018. The Group also on-boarded several new Brand Partners including Kanebo and Sloggi for Malaysia and Singapore respectively.

During the year, we entered into a collaboration agreement with United Overseas Bank Limited (“UOB”) to help SME in SE Asia expand their e-commerce business. As UOB’s preferred commerce enabling partner, UOB’s SME clients will have preferential access to Synagie’s range of user-friendly, end-to-end e-commerce solutions. Synagie’s platform also provides real-time Big Data analytics to help businesses understand their customers’ buying preferences and offers on-demand warehousing and fulfilment services on a pay-per-use basis. This collaboration will begin with UOB’s SME clients base in Singapore, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. We will continue to strengthen our value proposition as a leading e-commerce enabler by constantly innovating and offering integrated solutions to help our Brand Partners to effectively manage their online presence.

In April 2018, we acquired Insurtech Subsidiary, which has more than seven years of experience in providing regional third-party administration services for extended warranty, accidental damage protection as well as after sales support and call centre services to Fortune 500 companies in the computer, communication and consumer electronics (“3C”) sector across SE Asia, India, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# CEO’S MESSAGE

After the acquisition of our Insurtech Subsidiary, we started developing a cloud insurance platform that provides digital distribution, claims automation and dynamic pricing for insurance products. In 2018 alone, our Insurtech Subsidiary processed more than S$500.0 million in insurance coverage and above 780,000 insurance policies. Moving forward, the Group intends to leverage on its domain expertise and technology to penetrate the growing insurtech market in SE Asia using its cloud insurance platform.

In March 2019, we launched Kiasu.me, a new on demand lifestyle insurance mobile app and cloud insurance platform, that offers affordable and instant protection for consumers. Powered by Artificial Intelligence and backed by the world’s leading insurers, it provides instant coverage and delivers “pay-as-you-use” lifestyle insurance coverage.

The first product offered by Kiasu.me is Device Shield – a 12-month, app-based accidental screen damage protection for brand new mobile phones that is underwritten by a regional A-rated insurer. Other innovative insurance products are in the pipeline, which include cyber risks and family insurance that will be available on the Kiasu.me mobile app.

At this juncture, we would like to express our appreciation to the Board for their stewardship. We would also like to thank the Management team for their dedication and commitment. And on behalf of the Management, I would like to convey my heartfelt gratitude towards our shareholders, customers, brand partners and business associates for their strong support and confidence in Synagie.

We look forward to advancing the Company to greater heights, as we endeavour to seek more partnerships and expand our business and service offerings in the coming year.

# REVIEW OF THE GROUP’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

# Revenue

The Group’s revenue surged by 99.9% or S$8.1 million, from S$8.0 million in FY2017 to S$16.1 million in FY2018. This was mainly due to (i) an increase in revenue from our e-commerce business segment, as a result of higher demand from online consumers for our Brand Partners’ products; (ii) increase in the number of our Brand Partners to over 270 in FY2018; and (iii) the first full year of operations for our business expansion into Malaysia and new revenue contribution from Insurtech Subsidiary.

Gross profit margin improved by 310 bps to 25.0% in FY2018 mainly due to higher contribution of services revenue from our e-logistics and new insurtech business segment, which delivers higher margins compared to distribution revenue from our e-commerce business segment.

# Other operating expenses

Other operating expenses increased by 160.6% or S$0.2 million from S$0.1 million in FY2017 to S$0.3 million in FY2018, mainly due to impairment loss of trade receivables and inventories written off.

# Finance costs

Finance costs increased by 203.9% or S$0.4 million from S$0.2 million in FY2017 to S$0.6 million in FY2018, largely attributed to the amortisation of Convertible Notes issued in connection with our pre-IPO fund raising.

Current assets increased by 199.4% or S$12.1 million, from S$6.1 million as at 31 December 2017 to S$18.2 million as at 31 December 2018, mainly attributed to increase in deferred costs and receivables of S$2.7 million and S$2.3 million respectively contributed from Insurtech Subsidiary, as well as increase in cash and cash equivalents of S$5.7 million.

# ECONOMIC OBJECTIVE

We aim to revolutionise commerce through our ecosystem and create long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders.

# APPROACH

# (a) Creating Economic Value

In building a business that has sustainable long-term growth prospects, we have not only focused in profit generation, but also remained focused on growth strategies, to enhance value creation for various stakeholders involved. To achieve our business and growth objectives, we adopt the following strategies:

Employees at our new product launch event

# Increase number of Brand Partners and optimise product mix

We aim to increase the number of our Brand Partners through regional expansion and by cooperating with our ecosystem partners for Brand Partner referrals. We believe that our strong track record and reputation in Singapore for providing quality end-to-end e-commerce solutions gives us an advantage in new Brand Partner acquisition. We seek to further optimise our product catalogue mix to include more consumer products. As at the end of FY2018, we have more than 270 Brand Partners, with well-known brands such as, Johnson & Johnson, Kimberly-Clark and Shiseido, which use our e-commerce solutions.

# Enhance Synagie Platform and Big Data analytics capabilities

Our Group intends to enhance our Synagie Platform through the launch of a Synagie Software as a Service (“SaaS”) Platform targeted at SME. Our Group also has plans to roll out value-added services such as trade financing by working with financial institutions which will use our Big Data analytics solutions to provide invoice factoring facilities for online sales.

In addition, we intend to be more involved in the research and development of new technology that will further enhance our Synagie Platform such as Blockchain and Internet of Things.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# Expansion of ecosystem and geographical market

As at the end of FY2018, our largest market presence is in Singapore, followed by Malaysia. We aim to continue our geographical market expansion into new jurisdictions in SE Asia such as Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia by replicating our business model and customising our Synagie Platform to meet local requirements. Building on the open architecture of our Synagie Platform, our Group intends to increase connectivity with new ecosystem partners in the region that will help expand our distribution channels so that we may distribute, market and sell products to a larger audience.

# Expansion through acquisitions, joint ventures and/or strategic partnerships

We will explore acquisitions, joint ventures and/or strategic partnerships with prudence and will consider opportunities which will complement our existing operations and which are also beneficial to our strategic long-term objectives.

# Enhance insurtech business model

We seek to further transform our current insurtech business model, by digitising its core processes and integrating its business operations into our Synagie Platform. We also intend to leverage our Synagie Platform’s Artificial Intelligence and Big Data analytics capability to implement enhanced fraud detection mechanisms and to provide the infrastructure for our distribution channel partners or their merchants to offer warranty and protection services to consumers.

# (b) Product and Service Quality

Providing quality products and services to our customers is our utmost priority. All our customer service staff undergo customer service training and targeted coaching sessions to address consumer queries, feedback and complaints pertaining to product usage and pricing. We also monitor our response rate to customer feedback and have established key performance indicators for our customer service staff.

Big Data analytics is also employed in the identification of consumer trends and behaviour to better cater our products and services to match consumer demands. Furthermore, to ensure that customers timely receive their orders, we also require our logistics vendors to provide us updates on the delivery statuses of all orders.

# OUR PERFORMANCE

Synagie is ranked Number 1 fastest growing technology company in Singapore and Number 22 in Asia Pacific on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500TM Asia Pacific 2018. Rankings are based on percentage of revenue growth over three years.

Frost & Sullivan also rates Synagie as one of the fastest growing e-commerce start-ups in SE Asia, given our historical revenue compounded annual growth rate of 551.8% from 2015 to 2017.

# ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVE

We seek to be an environment-friendly corporation by combining strategies with everyday actions that collectively contribute to minimise our ecological footprint.

# APPROACH

Synagie engages mainly in e-commerce; our direct environmental impact consists of the use of electricity in our offices and warehouses, packaging materials, and general waste generated from the re-packaging of goods in our warehouses. Even though our direct ecological footprint is relatively small, we believe in doing our part as a global corporate citizen and contributing to global goals of climate change mitigation and resource conservation.

We are supportive of various initiatives undertaken by our Brand Partners to mitigate environmental impacts of our business.

# (a) Waste Management

At Synagie, our waste is limited to mainly packaging material, which includes cartons, plastic wraps, strings, wooden pallets and paper.

As part of our commitment to environmental preservation, we have put in concerted efforts to make waste management a part of our operations and processes. We adopt waste management policies and procedures to ensure that our warehouse waste is properly segregated and disposed by appointed licensed vendor.

We also seek to reduce waste disposal through ‘reduce, reuse and recycle’ of packaging material. Packaging material such as wooden pallets and carton boxes for goods packaging are reused at the warehouse whenever possible. Paper boxes are sold to waste recycling vendors for recycling.

To reduce office paper usage, we have adopted a paper-less system. Instead of sending hard-copy documents to customers and suppliers, we have opted for electronic modes of transmission. Employees are also encouraged to use double-sided printing and to reuse paper whenever possible.

# (b) Energy and Water Efficiency

We recognise that investing in energy conservation not only reduces our carbon footprint but also makes business sense in terms of the cost savings. Therefore, we incorporate energy and water saving initiatives into our daily operations. We actively track our energy and water usage at our office and seek ways to reduce consumption, such as installing motion-triggered lightings. We also have employee awareness initiatives to encourage them to turn off lights and air-conditioning in offices when they are not in use.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# OUR PERFORMANCE

In FY2018, we have complied with all environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions we operate in and there were no fines or penalties incurred for non-compliance.

We have begun tracking our water and electricity usage as we moved into our new office in mid of 2017. Through continuous monitoring and new conservation initiatives, we will be looking at improving our water and electricity efficiency in the following years.

|Electricity Usage|Electricity Intensity|
|---|---|
|18,827|Total office electricity usage in 2018 (kWh)|
|290|Office electricity usage (kWh) per employee|

|Water Usage|Water Intensity|
|---|---|
|331|Total office water usage in 2018 (Cu M)|
|5.1|Office water usage (Cu M) per employee|

# TARGET & PLANS

- Set up recycling bins in offices and warehouses
- Monitor and track amount of packaging material and paper used and seek ways to reduce amount of waste by 5% by 2021
- Improve energy and water efficiency – reduce electricity and water intensity by 2%

# SOCIAL OBJECTIVE

Corporate citizenship is a core component of our corporate responsibility strategy and we seek to empower our employees to make positive contributions to the communities we operate in.

# APPROACH

# (a) Talent Attraction and Retention

Competitive and equitable remuneration

At Synagie, we recognise the importance of a competitive and equitable remuneration scheme in attracting and retaining talents. Therefore, we are committed to providing all employees with equal opportunities for compensation, promotion and training on a meritocratic basis. Annually, we systematically review the work performance of our employees and use the performance evaluation as a basis for their annual salary review. The performance appraisal also provides a platform for open communication between employees and their direct supervisors.

Our employee benefits and human resource policies are also reviewed annually to ensure that they are competitive and aligned with manpower regulations in the jurisdictions we operate in.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# Employee benefits and welfare

Employees are given work flexibility and benefits to ensure that they remain motivated and driven. Our flexi-time work arrangement gives employees the flexibility to vary daily work start and end times to suit their work and personal commitments. Synagie also adopts all benefits and welfare practices which conforms to the manpower legislations of the various jurisdictions we operate in.

# Human rights and freedom of association

We respect the principles of freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, non-discrimination and harassment, meritocratic and progressive human resource practices, and advocates the elimination of forced or child labour. All employees under the Group are entitled to practice freedom of association, within regulatory limits of each jurisdiction which we operate in.

# Diversity

We see great strength in the diversity of our workforce and the potential in each and every one of our employees. Diversity provides different perspectives and fosters innovative thinking to solve business challenges. Our Employee Code of Conduct (the “Code”) guides us towards this aspiration.

We hire people from different backgrounds and have a diversified workforce across all age groups, races and genders as we value the experiences and knowledge that different individuals bring to the Group. We adopt a firm stance against human rights infringement and discrimination to ensure a conducive work environment for our employees.

# (b) Occupational and Safety

A commitment to employee health, safety, and well-being permeates our culture and forms the design of our processes and supply chain.

Warehouse and logistics operations exposes our employees to health and safety risks. A safe working environment provides greater assurance to our employees and customers. Hence, other than establishing safety policies and procedures, we also require all employees to undergo a half-day safety training to ensure that they are aware of the safety practices and precautionary measures at our warehouses. All employees operating Mechanised Handling Equipment (“MHE”) are also sent for courses and certified to operate the MHE.

Additionally, we provide all warehouse employees with the necessary personal protective equipment, such as safety vest and boots, to ensure that they are well-protected.

Recognising the importance of the state of health of our employees at the warehouses, we also provide them with health supplements, such as fish oil, glucosamine and vitamins, on a daily basis.

All employees in Singapore are covered under a basic medical insurance and benefits program, which insures against any injury or illness sustained in the course of employment that requires medical, surgical or hospital treatment. In addition, we provide travel insurance to employees who requires to regularly travel overseas for business.

We provide opportunities to our employees to participate in learning and development courses in order to upgrade their skills. Through our open annual performance appraisal system, we work together with our employees to identify knowledge gaps and address training needs.

In general, our new employees and junior staff undergo on-the-job training under senior employees who will train and equip them with the necessary knowledge and practical skills required.

We selectively send our employees to industry conferences, seminars, and trade shows in Singapore, from which they gain industry-specific know-how and insight, and form new business relationships from meeting and interacting with others in our industry. In addition, we may fund part-time courses for some of our employees on a case-by-case basis.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Listing Manual – Section B: Rules of Catalist (“Catalist Rules”) issued by the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) require an issuer to describe in its annual report its corporate governance practices with specific reference to the principles and the provisions of the Code. An issuer must comply with the principles of the Code. Where an issuer’s practices vary from any provisions of the Code, it must explicitly state, in its annual report, the provision from which it has varied, explain the reasons for variation, and explain how the practices it had adopted are consistent with the intent of the relevant principle.

On 6 August 2018, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued the revised Code of Corporate Governance (the “2018 Code”) and accompanying Practice Guidance, which supersedes the existing Code of Corporate Governance issued in 2012 (the “2012 Code”), is applicable to Company’s annual report relating to financial year commencing 1 January 2019. Notwithstanding the Company’s annual report financial year commenced on 1 January 2018, the Company has adopted the 2018 Code.

The Company believes that it has largely complied with the spirit and intent of the 2018 Code and in areas where the Company’s practices have deviated from the 2018 Code, rationale for the same is provided herein.

The Code is divided into five main sections, namely:

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Company has a training budget for its Directors to attend courses and seminars, which is utilised as and when needed. The Company relies on and encourages its Directors to update themselves on new laws, regulations and changing commercial risks in the industry. Accordingly, information on courses or seminars in relation to the roles and responsibilities as a director of a listed company as well as revisions to laws or regulations (which are applicable to the Company) are disseminated to Directors.

The Company also has in place orientation programmes for newly-appointed Directors to ensure that they are familiar with the Group’s structure, the Group’s business, and its operations. New Director(s) will be expected to undergo orientation with the Company which includes meeting with the Chairman and/or the Executive Director(s) for an introduction to the business of the Company.

Newly appointed Directors are encouraged to attend formal courses to familiarise themselves with the regulatory environment in Singapore and the roles and responsibilities as a director of a listed company.

Prior to the listing of the Company, Mr Lim Chuan Poh, Mr Chua Hwee Song, Mr Koh Chia Ling and Mr Chue En Yaw were appointed on 28 June 2018 (“New Directors”). Management had conducted an orientation for the New Directors to introduce the Group’s business and its operations. All Directors were actively involved in the verification meetings during the initial public offering (“IPO”) process, where they sought advice and guidance from external advisors as part of their induction programme. Each Director is provided with an updated manual containing Board and Company policies relating to the disclosure of interests in securities and conflicts of interests in transactions involving the Company, prohibitions on dealings in the Company’s securities, as well as restrictions on the disclosure of price sensitive information.

Ms Tai Ho Yan, Ms Zanetta Lee Yue, Mr Koh Chia Ling and Mr Chue En Yaw are Directors with no prior experience as a director of listed companies in Singapore. They had attended a formal course on compliance, regulatory and corporate governance matters.

The external auditors also briefed the AC members on the developments in accounting standards (where applicable) during AC meetings whilst the Company Secretary periodically updates the Board on any changes in the regulatory environment in Singapore as well as those pertaining to the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company.

In order to ensure that the Board is able to contribute in a meaningful manner during Board meetings, the Management provides the members of the Board with management accounts at each Board meeting, as well as relevant background information and documents relating to the items of business to be discussed at each Board meeting, such as copies of disclosure documents, budgets, forecasts and internal financial statements, before the scheduled meeting. Key information relating to the Company’s operations and finances are also circulated to the Board via email so that the Directors may monitor with ease the Company’s performance as well as the Management’s fulfilment of goals and objectives set by the Board.

The Directors are also regularly briefed by the Management of the Company on the business activities of the Company. The Directors are responsible for the Company’s strategic directions as well as its corporate practices and are accordingly briefed by the Management of the Company on the day-to-day implementation of such strategic directions and corporate practices.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD. ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Directors have separate and independent access to the Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), and Group Financial Controller (“Group FC”) and Company Secretary of the Company. The Company Secretary and/or representatives from the Company Secretary’s office attends all meetings of the Board and the Board Committees and prepares the minutes of such meetings. The minutes of such meetings are then circulated to the Board and the Board Committees, as the case may be. The Company Secretary also advises the Board on governance matters and ensures that the procedures for such meetings are in accordance with the Constitution and Terms of Reference and all applicable rules and regulations (including the requirements of the Singapore Companies Act, Cap. 50 and the Catalist Rules) are complied with. Further to the above, the Company Secretary helps to facilitate communications within the Board and the Board Committees and between Management and the Directors. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board as a whole.

The Company allows Directors to take independent professional advice on matters affecting the Company, and such costs will be borne by the Company. Further to the above, Directors have, at all times, unrestricted access to the Company’s records and information.

# PRINCIPLE 2: BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE

The Board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the Company.

As at the date of this Report, the Board comprises the following members:

|Name|Designation|
|---|---|
|Lim Chuan Poh|Non-Executive and Independent Chairman|
|Clement Lee Shieh-Peen|Executive Director and CEO|
|Tai Ho Yan|Executive Director|
|Zanetta Lee Yue|Executive Director|
|Chua Hwee Song|Non-Executive and Independent Director|
|Koh Chia Ling|Non-Executive and Independent Director|
|Chue En Yaw|Non-Executive and Independent Director|

Under the Constitution of the Company, the Board must comprise a minimum of two members. However, the Constitution of the Company does not impose any limit on the maximum number of Directors the Company may appoint. The composition of the Board is also reviewed on an annual basis by the NC to ensure that the Board has the appropriate mix of expertise, skill, knowledge, experience and gender diversity, and collectively possess the necessary core competencies for the effective functioning of and informed decision making in the Company.

Pursuant to its review of the Board’s size for FY2018, the NC is of the view that the Board’s size of seven Directors as at the date of this Report is appropriate and that the Board possesses the appropriate diversity – being a mix of skill, knowledge, expertise and experience to provide core competencies in areas such as accounting or finance, business or management experience, industry knowledge, strategic planning experience and experience or knowledge that are relevant to the direction of the expansion of the Group. The current Board comprises of two female Directors and five male Directors with an age group ranging from 42 to 63 years old.

The Board has a strong element of independence. In FY2018, four of the seven Directors are Non-Executive and Independent Directors, a majority of whom are Independent Directors. Mr Clement Lee Shieh-Peen, Ms Tai Ho Yan and Ms Zanetta Lee Yue are the Executive Directors and Mr Lim Chuan Poh, Mr Chua Hwee Song, Mr Koh Chia Ling and Mr Chue En Yaw are the Non-Executive and Independent Directors, appointed to the Board.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Non-Executive and Independent Directors also set aside time to meet without the presence of Management at each Board meeting, where necessary, to discuss matters such as the Group’s financial performance, succession planning, board evaluation performance as well as leadership development and remuneration of CEO. During the year, the Non-Executive and Independent Directors also held one session to discuss with internal auditors on the internal audit matters, and leadership development of the Group without the presence of Management.

As the Non-Executive and Independent Chairman is not the same person as the CEO and not an immediate family member of the CEO or part of the Management team, it is not a requirement for the Independent Directors to make up majority of the Board pursuant to Provision 2.2 of the 2018 Code. Nevertheless, the current composition of the Board complies with Provisions 2.2 and 2.3 of the 2018 Code where the Non-Executive and Independent Directors make up majority of the Board.

The Board and the NC are also of the view that the Board can exercise independent judgement on corporate affairs and that no one individual or group(s) of individuals dominates any decision-making process. There is currently no Independent Director who has served on the Board for more than nine years.

There are no alternate directors appointed to the Board as at the date of this Report.

Key information on each Director is set on pages 10 to 13 of the Annual Report.

The Board has no dissenting views on the Chairman’s message for the year under review.

# PRINCIPLE 3: CHAIRMAN AND CEO

There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

As at the date of this Report, the Company has a Non-Executive and Independent Chairman, three Non-Executive and Independent Directors, three Executive Directors, including the CEO. In addition, the Company also has a Group FC with specific areas of responsibility within the Company. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Non-Executive and Independent Directors, and the Management of the Company, who are also not related to each other.

The responsibilities of the Non-Executive and Independent Chairman include the following:

1. leading the Board, ensuring its effectiveness in all aspects of its role, and setting out its agenda;
2. ensuring that the Directors receive complete, adequate, accurate, timely and clear information;
3. critiquing key proposals by Management before they are presented to the Board;
4. ensuring effective communication with shareholders;
5. encouraging constructive relations between the Board and Management;
6. facilitating the effective contribution of the Non-Executive and Independent Directors towards the Company;
7. encouraging constructive relations between the Executive Directors and Non-Executive and Independent Directors;
8. promoting high standards of corporate governance.

The Board is of the view that the roles of the Non-Executive and Independent Chairman, the three Non-Executive and Independent Directors, Executive Director and CEO, the two Executive Directors and Group FC are separate, thereby ensuring an appropriate balance of power between them and creating increased accountability in both the Board and Management, as well as enabling greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making, without any concentration of power or influence residing in any individual. In view thereof, there is no need for the Company to have a lead independent director.

The NC does not currently set a cap on the maximum number of directorships that Directors may hold. Nevertheless, the NC shall meet up at least once a year and review the competing time commitments of Directors serving on multiple boards, if any. If a Director is on the board of other companies, the NC shall consider whether adequate time and attention have been devoted to the affairs of the Company.

The NC is responsible for the nomination of retiring Directors for re-election.

In determining the nomination of a Director for re-election, the NC takes into account the composition and progressive renewal of the Board, and the competency, performance and contribution of the Director including his attendance, preparedness and participation at Board and Board Committees meetings. A Director’s time and effort accorded to the Company’s business and affairs will also be considered.

Based on the above, Mr Lim Chuan Poh, Mr Chua Hwee Song, Mr Koh Chia Ling and Mr Chue En Yaw are required to retire pursuant to Regulation 107 and Mr Clement Lee Shieh-Peen (the “Retiring Directors”) is required to retire pursuant to Regulation 108(1) of the Company’s Constitution at the forthcoming AGM.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Board considers an “independent” Director as one who:

1. has not been employed by the Company or any of its related corporations for the current or any of the past three financial years;
2. does not have an immediate family member who is, or has been in any of the past three years, employed by the Company or any of its related corporations and whose remuneration is determined by the RC;
3. has not been a director of the Company for an aggregate period of nine years (whether before or after listing); and
4. is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the Company’s substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Director’s independent business judgment on the conduct of the Company’s affairs.

(Collectively, the “Independent Criteria”)

The NC reviews annually the independence of each Director based on the definition and Independent Criteria set out in the 2018 Code. Each Non-Executive and Independent Director is required to complete a Confirmation of Independence form drawn up based on the Principle 2 of the Code for the NC’s review and recommendation to the Board.

Taking into consideration the foregoing, the NC has determined Mr Lim Chuan Poh, Mr Koh Chia Ling, Mr Chua Hwee Song and Mr Chue En Yaw (who represent the majority of the Board) to be independent. Each of these Directors have also confirmed their independence. The Executive Directors are not independent by virtue of their service agreements with the Company.

# PRINCIPLE 5: BOARD PERFORMANCE

The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its Board Committees and individual directors.

In addition to the above, the NC is also responsible for adopting and implementing corporate governance measures to achieve good stewardship of the Company. In this respect, its responsibilities include:

1. proposing objective performance criteria which incorporates qualitative and quantitative factors to evaluate on an annual basis the performance of the Board as a whole and that of each Director (other than Executive Directors, who are evaluated by the RC);
2. implementing appropriate programmes for orientation and training of new Directors, and to update the Board on relevant new laws, regulations, and changing commercial risks in the industry, from time to time;
3. advising the Board on corporate governance issues, generally where they are not covered by other Board Committees, including but not limited to shareholders’ issues; and
4. performing other functions assigned by law, the Company’s Constitution, or by the Board from time to time.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

In assessing the performance and effectiveness of the Directors in fulfilling their duties, the NC takes into account, among other factors, the Director’s qualifications in relation to general commercial knowledge, specific industry experience, political and social knowledge of the countries operates in, attendance at Board or Board Committees meetings in person or via teleconference, availability at all reasonable times and the degree of participation at Board and Board Committees meetings, quality of interventions or difference of opinion expressed, and any special contributions. The NC also considers whether the Director has a reasonable understanding of the Company’s business and the industry, the Director’s working relationship with the other members of the Board, as well as feedback from other Directors.

In assessing the performance and effectiveness of the Board and its Committees, the NC takes into account, among other factors, the Board Committees’ and the Board’s ability to work with the senior management of the Company, the discussions and due deliberations of the Board Committees and the Board, and whether objectives and targets set at the commencement of the relevant financial years have been met.

After evaluation, the NC considered the performance and effectiveness of each individual Director and the Board as a whole, to be satisfactory. The Board as a whole considered the performance of the NC to be satisfactory. For the avoidance of doubt, each member of the NC abstains from voting on any resolution in respect of the assessment of his performance or re-nomination as Director.

Reviews of each individual Board member’s performance and effectiveness, as well as the performance and effectiveness of the Board Committees and the Board are undertaken on a continuous basis by the NC with inputs from the various Board members. Renewals or replacements of Directors do not necessarily reflect their contributions to date but may be driven by the need to position and shape the Board in line with the medium-term needs of the Company and its business.

No external facilitator was engaged in FY2018. The NC has full authority to engage external facilitator to assist the NC to carry out the evaluation process, if the need arises.

# B. REMUNERATION MATTERS

# PRINCIPLE 6: PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPING REMUNERATION POLICIES

The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and key management personnel. No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

# PRINCIPLE 7: LEVEL AND MIX OF REMUNERATION

The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and key management personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the Company.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

# PRINCIPLE 8: DISCLOSURE ON REMUNERATION

The Company is transparent on its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation.

The RC comprises the following members:

|Lim Chuan Poh (Chairman)|Non-Executive and Independent Chairman|
|---|---|
|Koh Chia Ling|Non-Executive and Independent Director|
|Chue En Yaw|Non-Executive and Independent Director|

The RC is governed by its own TOR and its primary function is to advise the Board on compensation issues. In particular, in relation to the Directors and key management personnel, the RC bears in mind that a meaningful portion of their compensation should be contingent upon the financial performance of the Company, in order to foster the creation of long-term shareholder value.

Its responsibilities include the following:

1. recommending to the Board a framework of remuneration for the directors and executive officers, and determining specific remuneration packages for each executive director and any CEO (or executive of equivalent rank), if a CEO is not an executive director, such recommendations to be submitted for endorsement by the entire Board and should cover all aspects of remuneration, including but not limited to director’s fees, salaries, allowances, bonuses, the contingent awards of shares in the Company granted or which may be granted pursuant to its performance share plan to be granted under the Company’s performance share plan, the options to be issued under the Company’s employee share option scheme and benefits in kind;
2. in the case of service contracts (if any) for any director or executive officer, considering what compensation commitments the directors’ or executive officers’ contracts of service, if any, would entail in the event of early termination with a view to be fair and avoid rewarding poor performance; and
3. in respect of any long-term incentive schemes including share schemes as may be implemented, considering whether any director should be eligible for benefits under such long-term incentive schemes.

The RC meets once a year and at other times as required, in accordance with its TOR. The RC comprises three members and all the members, including RC Chairman are independent. The Chairman of the RC reports formally to the Board on its proceedings after each meeting on all matters within its duties and responsibilities.

The Management, together with the RC, recommends the compensation for Non-Executive and Independent Directors, taking into account factors such as time spent and the responsibilities of the Directors, the current market circumstances, long-term interest and risk policies of the Company, and the need to attract directors of experience and standing. The Non-Executive and Independent Directors’ fees are compared against market standards to ensure that they are in line with market norms and to ensure that their independence are not compromised.

As the members of the RC do not participate in any decisions concerning their own remuneration, Management takes on that role and the Board accepts the Management’s recommendation. Payment of Directors’ fees is subject to shareholders’ approval at the AGM. The RC and the Board are of the view that the compensation of the current Non-Executive and Independent Directors is adequate and not excessive.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The RC administers the Synagie Employee Share Option Scheme (“Synagie ESOS”) and the Synagie Performance Share Plan (“Synagie PSP”), which were approved by the Company’s shareholders by way of members’ resolution in writing on 25 July 2018. The performance related elements of remuneration are designed to align the interests of Directors, Management and staff with those of shareholders and to link their rewards to corporate and individual performance. Details of the Synagie ESOS and the Synagie PSP can be found on pages 68 to 70 of the Annual Report in the Directors’ Statement. The Company had not granted share options and awards to any employees and Directors under the Synagie ESOS and the Synagie PSP during FY2018.

Non-Executive and Independent Directors receive basic directors’ fees and additional fees for serving as a Board Committees Chairman. Executive Directors do not receive directors’ fees. A long-term incentive scheme for Directors, Management and staff includes Synagie ESOS and Synagie PSP.

A prorated directors’ fees of S$123,474 for FY2018 had been paid/payable to Non-Executive and Independent Directors and will be recommended to shareholders for ratification at the forthcoming AGM. Directors’ fees of S$232,000 for the financial year ending 31 December 2019, which are to be paid quarterly in arrears, will be recommended to the shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM. The actual directors’ fees paid out will be disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report in the relevant financial year.

The Management, together with the RC, determines and recommends to the Board the compensation package of the Executive Directors, taking into account their experience and knowledge as well as the existing circumstances in the employment market.

The Company does not use contractual provisions to allow the Company to reclaim incentive components of remunerations from Executive Directors and key management personnel in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial results or misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Company. The Executive Directors owe a fiduciary duty to the Company. The Company should be able to avail itself to remedies against the Executive Directors in the event of such breach of fiduciary duties. The RC will review such contractual provisions as and when necessary. The Independent Directors and Non-Executive Chairman are paid a director’s fee, consisting of a base fee and fees for chairing Board Committees Meetings, for their effort and time spent and for their responsibilities and contribution to the Board. The RC ensures that the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and key management personnel are fair. The RC’s recommendations are submitted to the entire Board for endorsement. Each member of the RC shall abstain from voting on any resolutions and making any recommendations and/or participating in any deliberations of the RC in respect of his remuneration packages.

With regard to the remuneration of other key management personnel, the RC, together with the Management, reviews proposals which are made by the Executive Directors. The remuneration policy for the key management personnel is guided by the National Wage Council guidelines, and takes into consideration the Company’s performance, long-term interest and risk policies, as well as the responsibilities and performance of individual key management personnel. The latter is measured by goals and objectives set for each key management executive in congruence with the Company’s overall goals and objectives.

The NC and the RC have reviewed the terms of the service agreements for the Executive Directors and they are of the view that the Executive Directors have service agreements which include fair and reasonable terms for termination under appropriate notice and these service agreements are in line with market practices and are not overly generous. The Company has not engaged any remuneration consultants for FY2018 and will continue to monitor the need to engage external remuneration consultants going forward and where applicable, will review the independence of the external firm before any engagement.

Details of the Directors’ and key management personnel’s remuneration for FY2018 are set out below. Disclosure of the Directors’ and key management personnel’s remuneration is also made in Note 6 to the financial statements.

# PRINCIPLE 9: RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the Company and its shareholders.

The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the overall risk management and internal control framework but also recognises that all risk management and internal control systems contain inherent limitations and that no cost-effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities, as a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against misstatements or losses. The Board and AC review regularly the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems, including but not limited to financial, operational, and compliance controls. In particular, the Company has adopted a “Whistleblowing” policy to ensure that there are no irregularities in the Company’s business dealings and that there is a system of integrity and reliability.

The Board has received assurance from each of the Executive Directors (including the CEO) and Group FC that the financial records of the Group for FY2018 have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group’s operations and finances.

In addition, the CEO and the key management personnel have also given assurance to the Board that the risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective in addressing the financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks.

The Board has reviewed and evaluated the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company’s system of risk management and internal controls and work procedures and processes. Internal controls have been put in place to safeguard the shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets, and to ensure that the Company’s financial statements give a true and fair view of the Company’s operations and finances.

Taking into account the Company’s corporate structure and scope of operations and based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by the external and internal auditors, and reviews performed by Management, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the Company’s internal controls, addressing financial, operations, compliance and information technology risks, and risk management systems were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2018.

# PRINCIPLE 10: AUDIT COMMITTEE

The Chairman of the AC reports formally to the Board on its proceedings after each meeting on all matters within its duties and responsibilities.

The AC has in place “Whistleblowing” arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns either verbally or in writing (via email) about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters within the Company to the members of the AC directly. The objective is to ensure that arrangements are in place for independent investigations of such matters and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken. Copies of the “Whistleblowing” policy have been circulated to the employees and are also available at the Company’s registered office.

Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) is an audit firm registered with the Singapore Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority and its was appointed as the Company’s external auditors on 28 March 2018.

In accordance with Rule 1204(6) of the Catalist Rules, the non-audit fees and audit fees paid to Deloitte for their services rendered in FY2018 are S$30,300 and S$293,000(1), respectively, (excluding disbursements and GST).

Deloitte was also appointed in FY2017 to audit the accounts of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company has therefore acted in compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 of the Catalist Rules.

The AC reviewed the independence and objectivity of the external auditors as required under Section 206(1A) of the Companies Act and determined that the external auditors were independent in carrying out their audit of the Group’s financial statements.

None of the members of the AC are a partner or director of Deloitte or any other auditing firm or auditing corporation. The AC had also reviewed the scope and quality of the external auditors’ work before recommending the external auditors to the Board for re-appointment.

After taking into account the resources and experience of Deloitte and the audit engagement partner assigned to the audit, Deloitte’s other audit engagements, the size and complexity of the audit for the as well as the number and experience of the staff assigned by Deloitte for the audit, the AC is of the view that Deloitte is able to meet its audit obligations. Together with the Board, the AC recommends the re-appointment of Deloitte at the forthcoming AGM.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The external auditors also brief the AC members on the developments in accounting standards (where applicable) during AC meetings to keep the AC members abreast of changes to the accounting standards and issues which have a direct impact on financial statements. The AC has full access to the external auditors and internal auditors without the presence of Management and is authorised to have full and unrestricted access to Management and all personnel, records, operations, properties, and other informational sources of the Company as required or desirable to properly discharge its responsibilities.

The AC has met with the external auditors and internal auditors without the presence of management in FY2018. The AC has full discretion to invite any Director or executive officer to its meetings and has the authority to conduct or authorise investigations into any matters within its scope of responsibilities.

The AC and Management also review the Company’s operational activities on an on-going basis to identify areas of material risks. The AC together with the Management and the internal and external auditors will table all control issues and review the appropriate measures being recommended to mitigate areas of weaknesses highlighted to the Board during its half yearly meetings.

The Company has engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers Risk Services Pte. Ltd. (“PWC”), a suitably appointed qualified firm of accountants which meets the standards set by internationally recognised professional bodies including the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of Internal Auditors, to conduct an internal audit of the Company as well as to implement enterprise risk management (“ERM”) initiatives within the Group to assist in determining whether the Group’s checks and balances and control systems are adequate.

The Board formalized and approved an Enterprise Risk Management Framework. This risk framework has four principal risk categories, namely strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks.

The Group’s risk management framework is aligned with the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Internal Controls Integrated Framework.

The identification and management of risks are delegated to management, who assumes ownership and day-to-day management of these risks. Management is responsible for the effective implementation of risk management strategy, policies and processes to facilitate the achievement of business plans and goals within the risk tolerance established by the Board key business risks are proactively identified, addressed and reviewed on an ongoing basis.

PWC has unfettered access to all the Company’s documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the AC. PWC reports directly to the AC and provides reports to AC on a timely basis.

The AC is of the view that the Internal Audit function has adequate resources to perform its functions, is independent from the activities that it audits and has appropriate standing within the Group. In assessing the engagement of PWC for the Internal Audit function, the AC ensured that the Internal Audit function is staffed with qualified and experienced personnel. The scope of the internal audit covers key aspects of the Group’s internal controls established to address financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks. The internal auditor’s activities are guided by PWC’s global internal auditing methodology which is in line with the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by The Institute of Internal Auditors.

At present, the Board relies on external audit reports and management letters prepared by the external auditors, PWC’s internal audit findings and ERM report on any material non-compliance or internal control weaknesses.

The AC has also set in place certain internal controls (for example, setting limits on transactions amounts and having different bank signatories), risk management practices and sustainability practices, taking into consideration the risks which the Group is exposed to, the likelihood of occurrence of such risks, the costs of implementing the corresponding controls and the environmental and social interactions within the communities in which the issuers operate.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Synagie Corporation Ltd. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2018, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group and the statement of changes in equity of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 76 to 135.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act”) and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (the “SFRS(I)s”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2018 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and of the changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

|Key Audit Matters|Our audit performed and responses thereon|
|---|---|
|Acquisition of subsidiary (Refer to Note 29 to the financial statements)|Our audit procedures focused on evaluating and challenging the key assumptions used by management in the PPA exercise for the acquisition of Insurtech Subsidiary. We performed the following procedures: - Obtained and read the term sheets and addendums to understand the key terms and conditions of the acquisition;
- Evaluated the competency, capabilities and objectivity of the independent valuation specialist engaged by the management for the PPA exercise;
- Engaged our internal valuation specialist to assess key assumptions such as future contract revenue and gross margins and valuation methodology used in the PPA exercise in determining the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed;
- Evaluated management’s key assumptions in determining the useful life of intangible assets.
|

The allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, and the identification and valuation of intangible assets and resulting goodwill arising from the business combination required significant judgment and the use of key management assumptions such as future contract revenue and gross margins.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

1. identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
2. obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
3. evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
4. conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
5. evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

(f) obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Mr Adrian Chia Jet Wui.

# 1. GENERAL (CONTINUED)

Basis of preparation of the combined financial statements

The Group resulting from the Restructuring Exercise above is regarded as a continuing entity throughout the years ended 31 December 2017 and 1 January 2017 as the Group is ultimately controlled by the common shareholders who collectively have the power to govern its financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities both before and after the Restructuring Exercise.

Accordingly, although the Company is only incorporated on 28 June 2017, the consolidated financial statements of the Group for these financial periods have been prepared using the principles of merger accounting on the basis that the Restructuring Exercise transfers the equity interest in the combining entities under the common control to the Company has been affected as at the beginning of these period presented in the consolidated financial statements.

# 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING – The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below, and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act and SFRS(I)s.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability which market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of SFRS(I) 1-17 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in SFRS(I) 1-2 Inventories or value in use in SFRS(I) 1-36 Impairment of Assets.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

- a) Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;
- b) Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
- c) Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION – The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and entities (including structured entities) controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company:

- • has power over the investee;
- • is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
- • has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:

- the size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders;
- potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;
- rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
- any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group’s accounting policies.

In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment in net recoverable value that has been recognised in profit or loss.

# BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under the SFRS(I)s are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:

- deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes and SFRS(I) 1-19 Employee Benefits respectively;
- liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment transactions of the acquiree or the replacement of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards transactions of the acquirer in accordance with SFRS(I) 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and
- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with SFRS(I) 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year from acquisition date.

# FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

# Financial assets

All financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of financial assets is under a contract whose terms require delivery of assets within the time frame established by the market concerned.

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# Classification of financial assets

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI):

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial asset; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

By default, all other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).

Despite the aforegoing, the Group may make the following irrevocable election/designation at initial recognition of a financial asset:

- the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment in other comprehensive income if certain criteria are met; and
- the Group may irrevocably designate a debt investment that meets the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria as measured at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.

# Amortised cost and effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.

For financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) excluding expected credit losses, through the expected life of the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross carrying amount of the debt instrument on initial recognition. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows, including expected credit losses, to the amortised cost of the debt instrument on initial recognition.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance. On the other hand, the gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any loss allowance.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method for debt instruments measured subsequently at amortised cost and at FVTOCI. For financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired. For financial assets that have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If, in subsequent reporting periods, the credit risk on the credit-impaired financial instrument improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired, interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.

For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Group recognises interest income by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset from initial recognition. The calculation does not revert to the gross basis even if the credit risk of the financial asset subsequently improves so that the financial asset is no longer credit-impaired.

Interest income is recognised in profit or loss under “other income” line item.

# Financial assets at FVTPL

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. Specifically:

- investments in equity instruments are classified as at FVTPL, unless the Group designates an equity investment that is neither held for trading nor a contingent consideration arising from a business combination as at FVTOCI on initial recognition.
- debt instruments that do not meet the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria are classified as at FVTPL. In addition, debt instruments that meet either the amortised cost criteria or the FVTOCI criteria may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases. The Group has not designated any debt instruments as at FVTPL.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value as at each reporting date, with any fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 4b(vii).

# Foreign exchange gains and losses

The carrying amount of financial assets that are denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate as at each reporting date. Specifically,

- for financial assets measured at amortised cost that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the “other income” or “other operating expenses” line item; and
- for financial assets measured at FVTPL that are not part of a designated hedging relationship, exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the “other income” or “other operating expenses” line items.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (“ECL”) on investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI, contract assets, as well as on loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. No impairment loss is recognised for investments in equity instruments. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade receivables and contract assets. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate.

For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If, on the other hand, the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. The assessment of whether lifetime ECL should be recognised is based on significant increases in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring.

Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. In contrast, 12-month ECL represents the portion of lifetime ECL that is expected to result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date.

# Significant increase in credit risk

In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition. In making this assessment, the Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information considered includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other similar organisations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast economic information that relate to the Group’s core operations, namely e-commerce solutions provider, e-logistics services and insurtech businesses.

In particular, the following information is taken into account when assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition:

- existing or forecast adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations;
- an actual or expected significant deterioration in the operating results of the debtor;

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

# FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

• significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same debtor; and

• an actual or expected significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the debtor that results in a significant decrease in the debtor’s ability to meet its debt obligations.

Irrespective of the outcome of the above assessment, the Group presumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due, unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates otherwise.

Despite the aforegoing, the Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date. A financial instrument is determined to have low credit risk if i) the financial instrument has a low risk of default, ii) the borrower has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term and iii) adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil its contractual cash flow obligations.

The Group regularly monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and revises them as appropriate to ensure that the criteria are capable of identifying significant increase in credit risk before the amount becomes past due.

# Definition of default

The Group considers the following as constituting an event of default for internal credit risk management purposes as historical experience indicates that receivables that meet either of the following criteria are generally not recoverable.

• when there is a breach of financial covenants by the counterparty; or

• information developed internally or obtained from external sources indicates that the debtor is unlikely to pay its creditors, including the Group, in full (without taking into account any collaterals held by the Group).

Irrespective of the above analysis, the Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# Credit-impaired financial assets

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes observable data about the following events:

- significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;
- a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;
- the lender(s) of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the lender(s) would not otherwise consider;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.

# Write-off policy

The Group writes off a financial asset when there is information indicating that the counterparty is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the counterparty has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings. Financial assets written off may still be subject to enforcement activities under the Group’s recovery procedures, taking into account legal advice where appropriate. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

# Measurement and recognition of expected credit losses

The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss if there is a default) and the exposure at default. The assessment of the probability of default and loss given default is based on historical data adjusted by forward-looking information as described above. As for the exposure at default, for financial assets, this is represented by the assets’ gross carrying amount at the reporting date; for loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the exposure includes the amount drawn down as at the reporting date, together with any additional amounts expected to be drawn down in the future by default date determined based on historical trend, the Group’s understanding of the specific future financing needs of the debtors, and other relevant forward-looking information.

For financial assets, the expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

Where lifetime ECL is measured on a collective basis to cater for cases where evidence of significant increases in credit risk at the individual instrument level may not yet be available, the financial instruments are grouped on the following basis:

- Nature of financial instruments (i.e. the Group’s trade and other receivables and amounts due from customers are each assessed as a separate group. Advances to related parties are assessed for expected credit losses on an individual basis);

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

- past-due status;
- nature, size and industry of debtors;
- nature of collaterals for finance lease receivables; and
- external credit ratings where available.

The grouping is regularly reviewed by management to ensure the constituents of each group continue to share similar credit risk characteristics.

If the Group has measured the loss allowance for a financial instrument at an amount equal to lifetime ECL in the previous reporting period, but determines at the current reporting date that the conditions for lifetime ECL are no longer met, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at the current reporting date.

The Group recognises an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investment revaluation reserve, and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset in the statement of financial position.

# Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss.

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments

# Classification as debt or equity

Debt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements entered and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# Equity instruments

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Group entity are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Repurchase of the company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the company’s own equity instruments.

# Financial liabilities

All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method or at FVTPL.

However, financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not qualify for derecognition or when the continuing involvement approach applies, financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group, and commitments issued by the Group to provide a loan at below-market interest rate are measured in accordance with the specific accounting policies set out below.

# Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is i) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination to which SFRS(I) 3 applies, ii) held for trading, or iii) it is designated as at FVTPL.

A financial liability is classified as held for trading if:

- it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or
- on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or
- it is a derivative, except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument.

A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading or contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:

- such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
- the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis; or
- it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and SFRS(I) 9 permits the entire combined contract to be designated as at FVTPL.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liabilities and is included in the “other income” or “other operating expenses” line item.

However, for financial liabilities that are designated as at FVTPL, the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognised in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’s credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss. The remaining amount of change in the fair value of liability is recognised in profit or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk that are recognised in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss; instead, they are transferred to retained earnings upon derecognition of the financial liability.

# Financial liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost

Financial liabilities that are not 1) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination, 2) held-for-trading, or 3) designated as at FVTPL, are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

# Convertible Notes

Convertible Notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component. The component parts of compound instruments are classified separately as financial liabilities and equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Conversion option that will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments is classified as an equity instrument. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible instrument. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis until extinguished upon conversion or at the instrument’s maturity date. The equity component is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole. This is recognised and included in equity, net of income tax effects, and is not subsequently remeasured.

Where conversion option will be settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the Company’s own equity instruments.

On initial recognition, the fair value of the liability component is determined using the prevailing market interest of similar non-Convertible Notes. The difference between the gross proceeds of the issue of the Convertible Notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the conversion option for the holder to convert the notes into equity, is included in equity (Convertible Notes reserve).

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

In subsequent period, the liability component of the Convertible Notes is carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The equity component, representing the option to convert the liability component into ordinary shares of the Company, will remain in Convertible Notes reserve until the conversion option is exercised, in which case the balance stated in Convertible Notes reserve will be transferred to share capital. Where the option remains unexercised at the expiry date, the balance stated in the Convertible Notes reserve will be released to retained earnings. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss upon conversion or expiration of the option.

Transactions costs that relate to the issue of the Convertible Notes are allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of the gross proceeds. Transactions costs relating to the equity component are charged directly to equity. Transaction costs relating to the liability component are included in the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the period of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest method.

# Foreign exchange gains and losses

For financial liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency and are measured at amortised cost as at each reporting date, the foreign exchange gains and losses are determined based on the amortised cost of the instruments. These foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the “other income” or “other operating expense” line item in profit or loss for financial liabilities that are not part of a designated hedging relationship.

The fair value of financial liabilities denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the end of the reporting period. For financial liabilities that are measured as at FVTPL, the foreign exchange component forms part of the fair value gains or losses and is recognised in profit or loss for financial liabilities that are not part of a designated hedging relationship.

# Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

# OFFSETTING ARRANGEMENTS

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when the Group and the Company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A right to set-off must be available today rather than being contingent on a future event and must be exercisable by any of the counterparties, both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.

# LEASES

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

# FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# The Group as lessee

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

# INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises finished goods and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

# PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

- Computers – 3 years
- Furniture and fittings – 3 years
- Office equipment – 3 years
- Renovation – 3 years

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

Fully depreciated assets still in use are retained in the financial statements.

# GOODWILL

Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary or the relevant cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

# INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets comprise software development costs which are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. Software developments costs are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to five years. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

# Intangible assets acquired in a business combination

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

The intangible assets pertain to customer relationships acquired through business combinations. These intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Management has assessed the appropriate useful lives to be five years. The estimated useful lives and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.

# IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiary is subject to annual impairment test or is more frequently tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.

# PROVISIONS

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

# GOVERNMENT GRANTS

Government grants are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the costs for which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Company with no future related costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.

# REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Group recognises revenue from the following major sources:

(a) E-Commerce – sale of Body, Beauty, Baby (“BBB”) products on online channels

The Group is involved in the selling of BBB products on online channels. Revenue from the sale of BBB products is recognised when control of the goods has transferred, being when the goods have been shipped to the customer’s location (delivery). A receivable is recognised by the Group and Company when the goods are delivered to the customer as this represents the point in time at which the right to consideration becomes unconditional, as only the passage of time required before payment is due.

Under the Group’s standard contract terms, customers have a right of return within 14 days. At the point of sale, a refund liability and a corresponding adjustment to revenue are recognised for those products expected to be returned. At the same time, the Group has a right to recover the product when customers exercise their right of return so consequently recognises a right to returned goods asset and a corresponding adjustment to the cost of inventories recognised in profit or loss. The Group uses its accumulated historical experience to estimate the number of returns on a portfolio level using the expected value method. It is considered highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognised will not occur given the consistent level of returns over previous years.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (b) E-Commerce – rendering of marketing support services

The Group provides a series of marketing support services. Such performance obligations are recognised
as a performance obligation over time. Revenue is recognised for these services over the contract period.
Management has assessed that the revenue recognition method is an appropriate measure of progress
towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under SFRS(I) 15.

# (c) E-Logistics – rendering of warehouse and logistics handling services

The Group provides a series of warehouse handling services – (1) Inbound deliveries; (2) Storage;
(3) order processing; (4) Pick, Pack and Quality Control; and (5) Outbound deliveries. The warehouse
handlings services are individually considered to be a distinct service as it is both regularly supplied by
the Group to other customers on a stand-alone basis and is available for customers from other providers
in the market. Transaction price are allocated to the individual warehouse handling services based on
its stand-alone selling price of these services.

Revenue relating to the warehouse handling services is recognised over time. Management has
assessed that the revenue recognition method is an appropriate measure of progress towards complete
satisfaction of these performance obligations under SFRS(I) 15.

# (d) Insurtech – rendering of warranty support services, including the related administration services in
handling and processing of warranty claims

The Group provides a series of warranty support services. Such performance obligations are recognised
as a performance obligation over time. Revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the period
of service. Management has assessed that the revenue recognition method is an appropriate measure
of progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations under SFRS(I) 15.

Revenue is measured based on the consolidation specified in a contract with a customer. The Group recognise
revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer.

# RETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS

Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense when employees have rendered the services entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes, such as the Singapore Central Provident Fund, are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans when the Group’s obligations under the plans are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.

# EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENT

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.

# INCOME TAX

Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported
in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or tax
deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been
enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end of the
reporting period.

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively).

# FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION

The individual financial statements of each group entity are measured and presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company are presented in Singapore dollar, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.

In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary items are included in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised other comprehensive income. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in other comprehensive income.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations (including comparatives) are expressed in Singapore dollar using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity under the header of translation reserve.

On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary company that includes a foreign operation), all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognised, but they are not reclassified to profit or loss.

In the case of a partial disposal (i.e. no loss of control) of a subsidiary company that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or loss.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in translation reserve (attributed to non-controlling interests, as appropriate).

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS – Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows comprise cash at bank and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

# 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

# (a) Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies

Management is of the opinion that any instances of application of judgements are not expected to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations (see below).

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENT

# 3  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)

# (b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

# (i) Acquisition of subsidiary

As part of the PPA exercise, management engaged an independent valuation specialist to assess the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Insurtech Subsidiary at the date of acquisition which was determined to be $4,405,000, including $1,916,000 of intangible assets pertaining to customer relationships and contracts. As a result, the remaining excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed amounting to $2,171,000 has been recorded as goodwill in relation to this acquisition. The intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefits of five years.

The allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, and the identification and valuation of intangible assets and resulting goodwill arising from the business combination requires significant judgment and the use of key management assumptions such as future contract revenue, gross margins and other factors. Details of the acquisition are disclosed in Note 29.

# (ii) Impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of subsidiary

Goodwill and intangible assets arise from the finalisation of the PPA exercise on the acquisition of Insurtech Subsidiary during the year. Intangible assets pertain to customer relationships and contracts carried at fair values at the date of acquisition and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefits of five years.

The Group is required to annually test goodwill for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. This assessment requires the exercise of significant management’s judgement of future market conditions, including revenue growth rates, discount rates, as well as the cash generating unit (“CGU”) on which the goodwill is tested for impairment.

The key assumptions to the impairment test and the sensitivity of changes in these assumptions to the risk of impairment are disclosed in Note 11.

# 3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (CONTINUED)

# (iii) Allowance for inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.

Management reviews the inventory listing on a periodical basis to identify aged inventories. This involves comparison of carrying value of the aged inventory items with their respective net realisable values. The purpose is to ascertain whether allowance or write-off is required to be made in the financial statements for any obsolete and slow-moving items. During the year, write-off of inventories and allowance for inventory obsolescence amounted to $118,000 (2017: Nil) and $54,000 (31 December 2017: Nil, 1 January 2017: Nil) respectively.

Management estimates the net realisable value for goods for resale based primarily on the selling prices at which the inventories could be realised. The carrying amount of the inventories is disclosed in Note 9.

# (b) Financial risk management policies and objectives

Management monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group to ensure appropriate measures are implemented in a timely and effective manner. These risks include market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.

# (i) Market risk management

The Group’s activities are exposed primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Management monitors risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchanges rates and interest rates and will consider appropriate measures should the need arises.

There has been no significant change to the Group’s exposure to market risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.

# (ii) Foreign currency risk management

The Group’s foreign currency exposures arise mainly from the exchange rate movements of the United States dollar against Singapore dollar.

At the end of the reporting period, carrying amounts of significant monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective group entities’ functional currencies are as follows:

| |Group|Company| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| |31 December 2018|31 December 2017|1 January 2017|31 December 2018|31 December 2017|

|United States dollar|1,475|20|23|–|–|

# Foreign currency sensitivity

The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the relevant foreign currencies against the functional currency of each group entity. 5% is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusted their translation at the period end for a 5% range in foreign currency rates.

* – Less than $1,000

# (iii) Interest rate risk management

Interest rate risk refers to the risk faced by the Group as a result of fluctuation in interest rates. No interest rate sensitivity was performed since the Group does not expect any material effect on the Group’s profit or loss as majority of its interest bearing instruments are subject to fixed interest rates.

# (iv) Overview of the Group’s exposure to credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. As at 31 December 2018, the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into account any collateral held or other credit enhancements, which will cause a financial loss to the Group due to failure to discharge an obligation by the counterparties arises from the carrying amount of the respective recognised financial assets as stated in the consolidated statement of financial position; and

The Group develops and maintains its credit risk gradings to categorise exposures according to their degree of risk of default. The Group uses its trading records to rate its major customers and other debtors. The Group does not hold collateral to cover its credit risks associated with its financial assets.

The Group’s current credit risk grading framework comprises the following categories:

|Category|Description|Basis for recognising ECL|
|---|---|---|
|Performing|The counterparty has a low risk of default and does not have any past-due amounts.|12-month ECL|
|Doubtful|Amount is >30 days past due or there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.|Lifetime ECL – not credit-impaired|
|In default|Amount is >90 days past due or there is evidence indicating the asset is credit-impaired.|Lifetime ECL – credit-impaired|
|Write-off|There is evidence indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and the group has no realistic prospect of recovery.|Amount is written off|

(i) For trade receivables, the Group has applied the simplified approach in SFRS(I) 9 to measure the loss allowance at lifetime ECL. The Group determines the expected credit losses on these items based on historical credit loss experience based on the past due status of the debtors, adjusted as appropriate to reflect current conditions and estimates of future economic conditions. Note 8 includes further details on the loss allowance for these receivables.

# (v) Credit risk management

Credit risk refers to the risk that debtors will default on their obligations to repay the amounts owing to the Group, resulting in a loss to the Group. The Group has adopted procedures in extending credit terms to customers and in monitoring its credit risk.

The credit policy sets out the guidelines on extending credit terms to customers, including assessment and valuation of customers’ credit reliability and periodic review of their financial status to determine credit limits to be granted.

The maximum exposure to credit risk in the event that the counterparties fail to perform their obligations as at the end of the financial year in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount of those assets as stated in the statement of financial position.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

# (vi) Liquidity risk management

The Group maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents, and internally generated cash flows to finance its operating activities. The Group has adequate credit facilities to meet all its operational requirements.

# Liquidity and interest risk analyses

# Non-derivative financial liabilities

The following tables detail the remaining contractual maturity for non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group and the Company can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. The adjustment column represents the possible future cash flows attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which is not included in the carrying amount at the financial liability at on the statements of financial position.

The Group and the Company’s non-derivative financial assets are repayable within one year and non-interest bearing (Note 8), except for short-term interests on cash balances (Note 7) which is relatively insignificant.

# (vii) Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair value of other classes of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in the respective notes to financial statements.

The Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following level:

1. quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);
2. inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices) (Level 2); and
3. inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).

# 4  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, FINANCIAL RISKS AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

The fair value of the other payable which comprise of mainly contingent consideration arising from business combination (Note 4), is measured based on Level 3. The valuation technique applied is discounted cash flow and key inputs are the present value of the expected future economic benefits that will flow out of the Group arising from the contingent consideration, discounted at the pre-tax cost of debt (estimated based on the industry weighted average cost of capital at the end of the reporting period).

There was no transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy in the period.

The following table gives information about how the fair value of the financial liability is determined, in particular, the valuation technique and inputs used.

|Fair value hierarchy as at|31 December 2018|31 December 2017|1 January 2017|Valuation technique(s)|Relationship of significant unobservable inputs to fair value|

| |–|–|–|Level 3|Discounted cash flow method was used to capture the present value of the expected future economic benefits that will flow out of the Group arising from the other payable.|
| | | | | |Discount rate of 6.33% per annum|
| | | | | |A slight increase in the discount rate used in isolation would result in an increase in the fair value|

During the financial year, an amount of $16,000 (2017: NIL) was recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as the fair value adjustment.

# Company

The Company had no financial assets or liabilities carried at fair value in 2017 and 2018.

# (c) Capital risk management policies and objectives

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged since incorporation.

The capital structure of the Group comprises only of issued share capital and reserves.

# 8 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (CONTINUED)

Loss allowance for trade receivables are measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. The ECL on trade receivables are estimated by reference to past default experience of the debtor and an analysis of the debtor’s current financial position, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions of the industry in which the debtors operate and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date. The Group has recognised a loss allowance of $20,000, representing receivables over 60 days past due.

There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting period.

A trade receivable is written off when there is information indicating that the debtor is in severe financial difficulty and there is no realistic prospect of recovery, e.g. when the debtor has been placed under liquidation or has entered into bankruptcy proceedings, or when the trade receivables are over two years past due, whichever occurs earlier.

The following table details the risk profile of trade receivables from contracts with customers based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience based on the past due status of the debtors, adjusted as appropriate to reflect current conditions and estimates of future economic conditions. As the Group’s historical credit loss experience does not show significantly different loss patterns for different customer segments, the provision for loss allowance based on past due status is not further distinguished between the Group’s different customer base.

|Change in loss allowance due to new trade receivables originated, net of those derecognised due to settlement|$’000| |20|–|–|
|At the end of the year|$’000| |20|–|–|

# Analysis of non-trade receivables

The amounts due from subsidiaries and a related party are non-trade, unsecured, interest-free and repayable on demand.

For purpose of impairment assessment, the non-trade receivables are considered to have low credit risk as the timing of payment is controlled by the Company taking into account cash flow management within the group of companies and there has been no significant increase in the risk of default on the amounts due from subsidiaries and a related party since initial recognition. Accordingly, for the purpose of impairment assessment for this non-trade receivables, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.

In determining the ECL, management has taken into account the financial position of the subsidiaries and related party, adjusted for factors that are specific to the subsidiaries and related party and general economic conditions of the industry in which the subsidiaries and related party operate, in estimating the probability of default of the trade amounts due from subsidiary and related party as well as the loss upon default. Management determines the non-trade receivables are subject to immaterial credit loss.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the CGU that are expected to benefit from the business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the Insurtech CGU, arising from the acquisition of Insurtech Subsidiary.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the future contract revenue, gross margins and other factors. Management estimates discount rate using pre-tax rate that reflect current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and expectations of future changes in the market.

# 11 GOODWILL (CONTINUED)

The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and thereafter budget a perpetual growth of 2.00%. This rate does not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets.

The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from the Insurtech CGU is 11.00%.

As at 31 December 2018, any reasonably possible change to the key assumptions applied not likely to cause the recoverable amount to be below the carrying amounts of CGU.

# 15 CONVERTIBLE NOTES

The Convertible Notes are unsecured, bear fixed interest at 6.00% per annum and intended for use as working capital and for the purpose of expansion by the Group prior to the listing of the Company.

As the conversion option is settled by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the Company’s equity instruments, the conversion option embedded in the Convertible Notes is classified as Convertible Notes reserve. At inception, the embedded conversion option is bifurcated from the host instrument and recorded as Convertible Notes reserve. The liability component of the Convertible Notes is initially measured at fair value net of related transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.

During the year, the Group had entered into additional Investment Agreements with various parties to raise Convertible Notes of $1,700,000. At inception, the fair value of the liability component of the Convertible Notes approximates to $1,042,000.

Pursuant to the Supplemental Agreements dated 25 April 2018, the Company substituted its subsidiary – BTFL Pte. Ltd. as the named borrower in the Investment Agreements entered into as at 31 December 2017.

On July 26, 2018, the entire principal amount of the Convertible Notes amounting to $4,523,000 was converted into 40,740,733 shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Notes as disclosed in Note 18.

This represents the fair value of the conversion option to convert the equity component of the Convertible Notes into ordinary shares of the Company, determined at the inception (Note 15).

On 28 July 2018, the entire principal amount of the Convertible Notes was converted into shares. Accordingly, the Convertible Notes reserve of $1,769,000 was converted to share capital of the Company as at 31 December 2018.

# 20  MERGER RESERVE

Merger reserve arises from the Restructuring Exercise which involved related parties under common control and represents the difference between the consideration paid by the Company and the equity of the subsidiary acquired under common control that are accounted for by applying the “pooling-of-interest” method.

# 21  OTHER RESERVE

This represents the excess of the Convertible Notes reserve and principal amount of the Convertible Notes upon conversion to share capital of the Company (Note 19).

Domestic income tax is calculated at 17% (2017: 17%) of the estimated assessable income for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.

The total charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting loss as follows:

| |Group|2018|2017|
|---|---|---|---|
|Loss before income tax| |(7,451)|(3,383)|
|Income tax expense calculated at 17%| |(1,267)|(575)|

As at 31 December 2018, the Group has unabsorbed tax losses of approximately $13,623,000 (2017: $7,551,000) available for offsetting against future taxable income. The unrecorded deferred tax benefits arising from unutilised tax losses and other temporary differences amounted to approximately $1,032,000 and $45,000 (2017: $468,000 and $78,000) respectively.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.

# 28 LOSS PER SHARE

The calculation of the basic and diluted loss per share attributable to the ordinary owners of the Company is based on the following data:

| |2018|2017|
|---|---|---|
|Loss for the year attributable to owners of the Company ($’000)|(7,387)|(3,383)|
|Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share|169,153,294|144,956,370|
|Basic and diluted (cents per share)|(4.37)|(2.33)|

The loss per share were computed based on weighted average number of shares adjusted to take into account the share split and conversion of Convertible Notes for the financial year ended 31 December 2018.

The number of ordinary shares outstanding was retrospectively adjusted for the effect of the share split. The number of shares outstanding is adjusted as if the share split was on the first day of prior year.

# 29 ACQUISITION OF A SUBSIDIARY

On 20 April 2018, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Insurtech Subsidiary for a cash consideration of $1,293,808; net of related party loans of $2,006,192.

This acquisition has been accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting. The transfer of economic interest in Insurtech Subsidiary was on 1 January 2018 whilst the transfer of legal interest in Insurtech Subsidiary was on 20 April 2018. All profits and receipts, and all losses and outgoing, accrual or payable in relation to Insurtech Subsidiary on and after 1 January 2018 shall belong to the Group.

The Insurtech Subsidiary is an entity incorporated in Singapore with its principal activity being the provision of information technology and computer services. The Group acquired Insurtech Subsidiary primarily for the addition of a complementary capability of the Group, allowing for potential opportunities to expand its customer base and service offerings.

Total consideration transferred (at acquisition date fair values):

| |$’000|
|---|---|
|Cash|1,294|
|Offset arrangement for related party loans|2,006|
|Contingent consideration arrangement(1)|3,026|
|Refund for excess of net cash balance(2)|250|
|Total|6,576|

(1) As part of the acquisition deal, an earn-out incentive will be awarded based on the financial performance of the Insurtech Subsidiary in 2018 and 2019. The contingent consideration requires the Group to pay the vendor an additional $3,300,000 if Insurtech Subsidiary’s revenue and profit after tax in each years 2018 and 2019 exceeds $5,500,000 (“Revenue Target”) and $1,300,000 (“NPAT Target”) respectively.

For financial year ended 31 December 2018 (“FY2018”), as Insurtech Subsidiary’s actual revenue and NPAT were below the Revenue Target and NPAT Target, the relevant shortfalls are carried forward to the Revenue Target for FY2019 (“Revised Revenue Target”) and the NPAT Target for FY2019 (“Revised NPAT Target”). The earn-out consideration of $2,000,000 (“First Earn-Out Consideration”) was withheld and deferred to 31 December 2019 (“FY2019”).

# SYNAGIE CORPORATION LTD.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2018

# NOTES TO FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018

# 29 ACQUISITION OF A SUBSIDIARY (CONTINUED)

For financial year ending FY2019, if Insurtech Subsidiary’s actual revenue exceeds the Revised Revenue Target and actual NPAT exceeds the Revised NPAT Target, an additional earn-out consideration of $1,300,000 will be paid out (“Second Earn-Out Consideration”) on top of the First Earn-Out Consideration.

If Insurtech Subsidiary’s actual revenue and/or NPAT falls short of the Revised Revenue Target and the Revised NPAT Target, the Group shall be entitled to offset the aggregate of the two shortfall amounts, from the aggregate of the First Earn-Out Consideration and the Second Earn-Out Consideration.

In the event if Insurtech Subsidiary suffers a net loss after tax in FY2019, the Group is entitled to demand from the Insurtech Vendor the amount of net loss after tax for the relevant year.

As at 31 December 2018, management is of the opinion that the earn-out incentive of $3,300,000 will be achieved. As a result, the associated payments of $3,300,000 have been duly accrued at the discounted rate of 6.30%, as “Other payable” under non-current liability.

(2) Upon completion of the acquisition, Insurtech Subsidiary’s net cash balance (determined as current assets minus current liabilities, excluding deferred service costs, prepayments and inventories as at 31 December 2017) exceeded the agreed amount of $3,300,000 by more than $250,000. On 2 May 2018, pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement and its addendums, the excess of net cash capped at $250,000 was refunded to the vendor.

# 29 ACQUISITION OF A SUBSIDIARY (CONTINUED)

Net cash outflow on acquisition of a subsidiary:

| |$’000|
|---|---|
|Consideration paid in cash|1,294|
|Refund for excess of net cash balance|250|
|Cash and cash equivalent balances acquired|(833)|
| |711|

Goodwill arising on acquisition:

| |$’000|
|---|---|
|Consideration transferred|6,576|
|Less: fair value of identifiable net assets acquired|(4,405)|
|Goodwill arising on acquisition (Note 11)|2,171|

Goodwill arose in the acquisition of Insurtech Subsidiary because the cost of the combination included a control premium. In addition, the consideration paid for the combination effectively included amounts in relation to the benefit of revenue growth and future market development. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets.

Intangible assets – customer contracts/relationships

The Group has also acquired the customer contracts and relationship of Insurtech Subsidiary as part of the acquisition. The identification and valuation of intangible assets arising from the business combination requires significant judgement and the use of key management assumptions such as future contract revenue, gross margins and other factors. These assets have been separately identified as intangible assets.

Impact of acquisition on the results of the Group

Revenue and profit after tax arising from the acquisition amounted to $2,861,000 and $506,000 respectively.

# 30 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION

For purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance, the Group’s chief operating decision makers have focused on the business operating units which in turn are segregated based on the type of goods and services supplied. This forms the basis of identifying the segments of the Group under SFRS(I) 8 Operating segments as follows:

Operating segments are aggregated into a single reportable operating segment if they have similar economic characteristics, such as long-term average gross margins, and are similar in respect of nature of services and process, type of customers, and if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment.

The Group has three reportable operating segments:

- E-Commerce – providing brand partners in transforming the traditional business models into an online model.

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following SFRS(I)s pronouncements were issued but not effective and are expected to have an impact to the Group and the Company in the periods of their initial adoption.

Effective for annual periods beginning or after 1 January 2019

SFRS(I) 16 Leases

The Standard provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their treatment in the financial statements of both lessees and lessors. The identification of leases, distinguishing between leases and service contracts, are determined on the basis of whether there is an identified asset controlled by the customer.

Significant changes to lessee accounting are introduced, with the distinction between operating and finance leases removed and assets and liabilities are recognised in respect of all leases (subject to limited exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets). The Standard maintains substantially the lessor accounting approach under the existing framework.

SFRS(I) 1-17 does not require the recognition of any right-of-use asset or liability for future payments for the operating leases that the Group enters into. Under SFRS(I) 16, the Group and Company may be required to recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all leases unless they qualify for low value or short-term leases upon the application of SFRS(I) 16. Additional disclosures may also be made with respect to leases, including any significant judgement and estimation made in distinguishing between leases and service contracts, on the basis of whether an identified asset controlled by the customer exists.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group and the Company have non-cancellable operating lease commitments as disclosed in Note 31. A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under SFRS(I) 16, and hence the Group and the Company will recognise a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low value or short-term leases upon application of SFRS(I) 16. The new requirement to recognise a right-of-use asset and a related lease liability is expected to have impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s and Company’s financial statements.

# 35  ADOPTION OF A NEW FINANCIAL REPORTING FRAMEWORK

Singapore-incorporated companies listed on the Singapore Exchange are required to apply a new financial
reporting framework SFRS(I), that is identical to the International Financial Reporting Standards for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.

The Group and the Company adopted the new financial reporting framework – SFRS(I) for the first time for
financial year ended 31 December 2018 and SFRS(I) 1 First-time Adoption of Singapore Financial Reporting
Standards (International) has been applied in the first set of SFRS(I) financial statements. SFRS(I) is identical to
the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB).

As a first-time adopter of SFRS(I), the Group and the Company have applied retrospectively, accounting policies
based on each SFRS(I) effective as at end of the first SFRS(I) reporting period (31 December 2018), except for
areas of exceptions and optional exemptions set out in SFRS(I) 1. In the first set of SFRS(I) financial statements
for the financial year ended 31 December 2018, an additional opening statement of financial position as at
date of transition (1 January 2017) is presented, together with related notes. Reconciliation statements from
previously reported FRS amounts and explanatory notes on transition adjustments are presented for equity as
at date of transition (1 January 2017) and as at end of last financial period under FRS (31 December 2017), and
for total comprehensive income and cash flows reported for the last financial period under FRS (for the year
ended 31 December 2017). Additional disclosures are made for specific transition adjustments if applicable.

There is no change to the Group’s and the Company’s previous accounting policies under FRS or material
adjustments on the initial transition to the new framework, other than enhanced disclosures arising from the
application of SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments and SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
