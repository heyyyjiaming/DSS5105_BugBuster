## Project Description
This an automatic system that extracts ESG information from unstructured reports and provides a comprehensive analysis of ESG performance within selected industries. By incorporating advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and data analysis, the tool helps streamline the ESG data extraction process, improve data quality, and offer valuable insights into corporate sustainability practices.

We're evaluating on the basis of SGX Metrics below.
